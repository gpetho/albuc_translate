Praefatio.	 Preface
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	 After having finished teaching you the book that follows and is complete with its explanation of medical sciences, I have come to an end in it. From reading this book's explanations and notes, I find it necessary for me to teach you this Treatise on surgery, which also includes manual skills required for performing surgeries.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	 Because the operation has been laid out in our region and time, because its knowledge is exhausted, it has fallen away; and they have not returned to what was necessary for its completion except these few notes from ancient books that were copied with their hands: and they came to destruction and confusion until all of them had been settled. I find it necessary for me to teach you this Treatise on surgery together with the manual skills required, which includes how to make use of Cautery tools and other surgical instruments according to its explanation, notes, abbreviation; that is, along with the forms of Cautery tools and the remaining ones used in the operation: as long as they have been added by these and taken from this necessary thing.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	 However, because the good surgeon does not come with his own hand in this time and place, there is: so that the teacher of medicine exercises before he becomes a master at knowing the parts of the body which Galen has described, until he knows about the joints of the bones, and their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of the joints between the ribs, and nerves, and ligaments, and numbering them all, and their exit from there, and pulse points, and quiet places, and the locations that have ended up with them.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	 And because of this, Hippocrates said, "the name is much and the work is little, but especially with regard to skill.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	 Now we have already spoken about that at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	 Since he is not aware of what we have spoken about anatomy, they do not come out unscathed; just as I heard many from those who are formed in this science and practice themselves without any knowledge or experiment.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	 Because the man had a stiff tongue from which blood flowed into the woman's neck, until it died by his hand
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	 And I saw another man who was superior to taking out the stone of wine, which he had prepared and the stone was great
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	 Therefore, it was brought to him, and he took it with a sieve of flesh.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	 Because the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	 And I had already called upon him to remove it; and he saw from the greatness of the stone, and with the infirmity of his strength that death would occur.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	 And I saw another man who had taken a staff near the place of our earth for medicine; and he struck him with blackness, which was by his hand, a fracture on his forehead near his heel; and the physician with his ignorance took away the fracture above the wounds with powder and strings, and walls of strength and did not release from death.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	 Therefore, he was released by his own desire.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	 After that, he released him from days and said to him not to abandon the chain; and he stayed there until his feet were bound and of his weight and was taken to destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	 Therefore, I went therefore; and he received in order to release the chain; and tranquility came upon him with his pain.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	 However, corruption had already occurred in the limb; and I could not delay it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	 Therefore, corruption ceased to walk around in the limb until death came.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	 And I saw another man who had pierced through a cancer-forming post; and it was ulcerated after days until great malice with its lord came upon him.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	 Because when a pure cancer is from the melancholy of the mind, then it should not be treated with all iron unless there is something that can tolerate it to be removed entirely from him.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	 For this reason, sons of man must learn that surgery is divided into two operations; one being with health and the other with peril involving multiple situations.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	 And I have brought this book to every place where operation is mentioned, where there is fear and trembling.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	 Therefore, you must be cautious of it (the operation) and dismiss the idea that one should rush to speak about it or describe it.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	 Therefore, with care and protection, and with the help of the sick, you will make a better path towards salvation and a worthy succession; and dismiss the great terrors of healing, for it may make your minds tremble at what it does to you, so that there is hope from above in faith and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	 However, this will be more advantageous for your glory, and higher in the world itself, and ultimately towards the number of you all.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	 Galen has already spoken in some of his teachings.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	 Do not practice fear during the night, for you are physicians by profession.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	 I am divided into three parts of this Treatise according to three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	 The first chapter
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	 The first chapter is about caution with fire and caution with acute medicine; it covers the head to feet of the body, its instruments, and all that is necessary for surgery.
Capitulum secundum.	 The second chapter
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	 The second chapter is about section and perforation; it covers phlebotomy and suction; and wounds; extraction of arrows; and the like; all chapters ordered by the forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	 The third chapter
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	 The third chapter is about restoration; it covers dislocations and twists; and the like; chapters ordered by body parts from head to feet with forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	 To God be glory alone.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	 "Book of Surgery
Pars I.	 Part One
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	 About the Opening of Flesh and Closing of Skin; To Which It Is Applied And When, Whether With Iron or Gold
Caput I.	 First Part
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	 Before We Begin the Operation with Him, It Is Necessary That You Say The Qualities of His Skin and Those Of The Scalp: And In What Form He Appears
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	 I therefore declare that the speech about the qualities of the skin for cautery and his wounds is a long one, subtle, wise, and hidden secrets are kept there.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	 I have already spoken of the many wise men and their dissenting opinions there; And to me it seems sufficient only from their speeches, fearing length.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	 I therefore declare that cautery is universally applied to all types of skin which are with or without material; excepting the two types which are hot and dry respectively.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	 In contrast, in the hot and dry skins the dissenting opinions occurred together.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	 Some have declared that cautery is appropriate for it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	 Others have declared the opposite, that cautery is not applicable to those with burns, whether hot or dry; because nature's heat lies in warmth, and therefore it cannot be treated by burning warm and dry things together if they are both hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	 He then declared the opposite, that cautery can be applied to all burns which are cold and dry, because when you compare a human body with its moisture, it appears as if there is frost on him.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	 And I say by way of an experiment that the opposite of what he said has already been proven to me several times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	 Nevertheless do not think it right that anyone should attempt to apply this without having already tried and practiced the last chapter on cautery, and knowing the diversity of skin types among men, their disposition towards burns themselves, and the causes of them all, as well as accidents which have occurred by them and time lapses.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	 "The other skin types have no fear of you.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	 "All doctors were present for them, and did not disagree with Cautious when he was among them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	 "The sons of Cautious know that from secret curations through Cautious with fire and good fortune to him is over Cautious when a medical treatment is combined. Because the action of fire is simple, whose action did not succeed unless cauterized on the part: and it does not hurt another member connected to her by connecting with caution.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	 "The action of the medical instruments was applied to that which extends from parts; and perhaps it does make the cutting difficult on the member healing, or perhaps fails.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	 "Fire because of its subtlety and substance goodness does not do that unless there is too much.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	 "We were unaware of that through an experiment because of the length of servitude and study with art, and position over the rights of things.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	 "And if it were not, because of this book I do not allow you to secret hidden in fire and quality of its operation in the expulsion bodies themselves, by which he expelled the fear of speech through philosophical demonstration, agreed upon your mind.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	 "The sons of Cautious know that at the time when it was to be done Cautious and better times for you.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	 "I tell that Cautious was done at all times; therefore, the accident because of the time falls down into injury when it is pulled by Cautious.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	 "Especially if Cautious is for the pain from necessary suffering forces, festivals that do not tolerate tardiness. Therefore, he fears with them, what did harm to malice is greater than the usual injury because of the time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	 "And not in the minds of your sons that it did not think unless only a fool and a doctor's foolishness know that it is not returned for ever: And place it as a consequence of it, things are not like they thought; because Cautious was not, unless there is a place to change the complexion, and spread the humidities which are caused, where the pains do occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	 However the cautery is necessary for medicine when its heat (or warmth) is applied to a patient's body and the doctor has confidence in his own skill as an operator, and if it causes no harm or injury to the master of the house; but if there is any risk that it might cause harm, then this should be avoided.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	 The subtility of the cautery applied to the extremities (or limbs) with excessive moisture and humidity, like a dentist's probe for pain relief, may be used when it does not cause harm or distress to that person.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	 However, this should only happen if there are few of them.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	 The second sentence is incomplete and seems to be missing a part of the phrase. Can you provide the complete sentence or help me fill in the gap?
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	 The second sentence should be corrected to say "the intent when we administer methods of curing with a cautery and don't confer them on the medicine; then we apply the cautery in the end of the matter, and grant it. Then from that moment, the cautery applied by the doctor is no longer needed according to the intention as understood by the public or doctors.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	 In the past, it was said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they did not say this except due to the equality of the value (or worth) of the substance itself, or its sublimity/excellence. And they also said that the place for cautery should never be made.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	 However, this is not absolutely true because I have already tried it and found that cautery does not do the same thing to all bodies or none of them.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	 And when combined with gold, it is beneficial and better than iron as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	 However, if you use iron for cautery in fire compared to gold, it is not given to you when the heat of the fire is equal due to its brightness or warmth; and also when it is brought near frost, ice, or added onto the fire above it, it makes water, quenches the fire, and extinguishes itself on wood.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	 "The artist is lost from that occupation; and because of this there arises a cautery with iron nearby us, at the place where we are located, for treatment.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	 "I have already ordered this Cautery's book according to the rules; and I ordered that from head to feet it be used, so that one seeking for what is missing may find it in him.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	 "The Cautery of the head in its crown.
Caput II.	 The Cautery of the second part of the head (i.e., the ear).
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	 "Here is the Cautery which extends over head and brain: these two causes are dryness and coldness; from the ear to eye sockets and auricle, and sleep, and tooth and throat pains; and universally all agitations caused by coldness, such as paralysis, and dryness, epilepsy, apoplexy.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	 "The Cautery's method is as follows: firstly to remove the pain by using a soothing remedy at once with the first application of water and vinegar three times in one night or four, according to the strength of the patient and his age and custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	 "Then order him to rub it [the Cautery] on his head with a towel.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	 "After that, put your hands together in such a way as to place them both over the top of his head where they have been placed.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	 "Then put your thumb on the middle of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	 "So that when you have pressed it [the Cautery] with all your force to this point, show him the other signs now.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	 "Then ignite the Cautery oil, which is its form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	 "Then place it on that spot with all your force; first, descending and pressing downward, until you are ready to release it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	 "Afterwards, loosen the hand of yours or quickly let go from there.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	 "If you now find out from the bone count of heads or hands separately, then take your own hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	 "If not, take the iron from you yourself or if someone else strikes your bones, until they show you which ones I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 "Then put something from the sale or that in water and drink it yourself and leave it at your place, and throw away what I told you three times.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	 "Then put on the drink yourself with butter and leave it at your place until the charcoal is burned away.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	 "And then cure that with unguent tetra-pharmacy, as long as you want.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	 They said, because the more wounds are opened up and exposed to the air, it emits pus; that is why it's better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	 And some of them said that the skin should be cautorized up to the nose; and they would hold on until something was burned in their nostrils.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	 "Then it was burned after what had been removed from a bone, then it was cured.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	 "And others said that it should be cautorized up to the end until an impression was made in their nose like a letter of the alphabet so they could die, as if by formic acid; or with something infused with alpha-beta, and they would spit out their wounds from this place after long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	 "And then it was cured until consolidated.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	 "But to me, there are no two types of cautery except those given by some people according to the way I fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	 "And leave it at that is better for my health with his blessings.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	 "The head became weak due to the natural continuous solution of his body; just as we were tested on other parts and especially when the head was frail by nature; and indeed the Cautery was first among all cures is more helpful for me, so it is used: thus I use it in order that its application may be beneficial.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	 "Healing a person's head with cautery brings about pain for the entire head.
Caput III.	 The third part of the body, i.e., the head
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	 When a person's head is afflicted with pain that lasts for all the head and becomes constant, so that they are weakened (i.e., suffering from the illness), they use ointments, oils, and vinegar
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	 If someone has already been healed with cautery on one of their body parts, we should not apply anything from that part to them at this point
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	 If a person's head is strong by nature and not weak or infirm, do not cauterize it with another cautery at that time
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	 Then cauterize the entire head of the person with that cautery and apply a bandage (discooperiatur) made from skin to cover up any cuts that may have occurred
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	 And cauterize the head with that cautery on a place where they say it is located and this is considered to be the entranceway of the body (uas): and you should not cover your mouth in that place.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	 The person becomes weak because of this pain for the head of all of them.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	 And I tell you this Cautery here (uas): it should be the cautery with which they cauterize their ears and eyebrows lightly, so that they may cauterize in the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	 This is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	 Healing with cautery for a migraine or headache, just as much when using medicine to treat it.
Caput IIII.	 The fourth part of the body, i.e., the ears and eyebrows
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	 When the pain occurs on one of the parts of the head and continues down to the eye or when a headache extends that far, they apply a treatment with medicines along with it (mundificantibus caput), and administer another cure as I mentioned in the division about illness, so do not cover them both: then cauterization is done according to two methods.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	 Cautery with a hot metal is used to burn away the tooth of one patient and remove scales from him, as well as cut off his limbs at two points
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	 Then, after he has removed the scab on that spot with a lancet and sucked out blood from it, let him put a piece of lint there to soak up any remaining blood.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Next, take him to that spot and bind it up with a bandage, until the wound is healed; then treat him with ointment as much as for twelve hours. Afterwards, lay him on his back in butter, so that the wound may be covered: afterwards, heal him with unguent and oil until he is cured.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	 And if you happen to have some medicines that are hot or burning, as I mentioned in the twelfth book of mine, for treating wounds by the Arabs
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	 The cautery is used with a metal tool.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	 The cautery looks like this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	 And it is called Claw's because its shape resembles the claw of a falcon; there are certain cuts on it and at its center lies an outstanding prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	 Afterwards put it on the spot and bind your hand; and with a little bit of iron, as much as is needed to cut through the skin, let him perform his task.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Afterwards take away your hand so that no artery remains below it and there is free flow of blood.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Afterwards pour the bandage on to water and put it there; afterwards lay him on his back with butter until he is healed; then treat him with unguent and oil until he is cured.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	 And if you have a second sharp tool called the second claw of Cautery for cutting off limbs.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	 And cauterize from making an incision into this wound without touching any nearby parts.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	 In the old way of cauterization for wounds.
Caput V.	 The Fifth Book
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	 When you are treating a hemiplegia (stroke), as we discussed in the preceding care and division of blood vessels, do not restore the treatment; instead look for a cautery to apply fire until the signs of pain over the place with the length of your fingers or like this: hold your hand by one side and strike it gently up to the artery, stopping when you feel burning.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	 However, it is necessary for you to also cauterize the continuation of the jaw, which may be affected during chewing and prevent its opening or movement in order not to fall into spasm.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	 And this is also important for ensuring safety regarding the arteries' blood flow which were cut off
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	 For it is from the cutting of them that there is fear and especially to him who did not know what was done or was not diligent nor an expert; therefore, he should remove the operation with him first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	 And I am using this reminder of procedures and their management of blood flow accidents from the second artery as it is described in its own place within this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 If you see from the fire that it is not sufficient to this Cautery, and if you tolerate the body's inflamed Cautery between the head, as we described, cure the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	 And if you administer Cautery which we mentioned in chapter of arteries with two Cauteries attached.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	 It is a more efficient and useful practice.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	 Regarding the burning of the ear
Caput VI.	 The Sixth Book
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	 When there is pain from the cold and it is treated with a solution and the remaining part of the care as we mentioned in division, do not remove the pain; instead apply fire Cautery. And that which is called "Punctum" whose shape is this one.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	 "In another part of the same ear, when he has inflamed it all around its entire circumference, as follows: either in the circumitus of one side if both sides are painful.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	 "And you with Cautery to the root of the ear, when you have inflamed places with cautery: and there be ten points of pain in every auricle, and so forth.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	 "Then cure the places until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	 "In this manner Cautery is done with Torture.
Caput VII.	 The seventh chapter of the head:
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	 Torture which is cured with Cautery, unless it be by the species which happen through phlegm, according to what we have said in divisions of Agitation.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	 And if Cautery is given to the species, that happened from Exejection and spasm of the nerves.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	 When you cure this species of Torture with ears and head, and gargling, and if your treatment is not present, then it is necessary that Cautery be given to the afflicted three times: one at the root of the ear, two below its own time, third at the junction of two lobes.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	 And you put Cautery upon the opposite side weakly
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	 Because softening does not happen unless it appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	 The form of Cautery is that Cautery be put directly beneath the top ear lobe, and another below its own length, which will depend upon how long it is compared to the fingers.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	 And you put your hand with Cautery until the number of cuts are burned off.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	 And this is the form of Cautery, and it is a species from a cuttler, whose shape was given: however it is not finer than that one, as you have seen, therefore it must be that the cuttler may also be in excess of excessive fat.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	 Then cure the place where it happened until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	 Cauterization for ancient apoplexy
Caput VIII.	 Section 8
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	 When ancient apoplexy occurs and you follow the instructions given above, but don't administer your cure, and if he is not feverish, then cauterize him with four burns on all his head hairs and a burn in the middle of his forehead as we said, so that there be a burn in the corner of his eye, according to what preceded. And the manner of cautery should follow that which proceeded it
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	 Also, cauterize with the cautery over the mouth of the stomach; and it is more ultimate than this one.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then he was cured as we said before
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	 Cauterization for a stroke
Caput IX.	 Section 9
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	 It is necessary that a big hole be made in the brain by using a powerful lye and foaming agents.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	 Then cut off his head completely, then lay a plaster over it as described in the treatise on plasters; and lay that many times upon it
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	 That is how cautery should be done; do this according to order as I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	 If so he is cured by that means it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	 If not, then cut off three burns on the back of his head as far down as he can go from the top of his head to the bottom of his eye; and lay a great burn between all the cauteries.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then cure the cautery with what proceeded it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	 If he is tolerant of that, then make a burn there as well.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	 If you are intolerant, then cut off burns on two corners of his head.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	 Then cure him until he is cured; and the cautery should be hot according to that which was prescribed before
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	 Cauterization for paralysis and relaxation
Caput X.	 Section 10
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	 "It is permissible for you to operate on the head with forceps and also as we have said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	 Afterwards you must burn it with a cautery on the middle of the head, and also all the hair on the top of the head, as well as three on each side of the temples, and three at the back of the ears, and six above the collar bone.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	 If you have many bruises and the patient is tolerant of pain (i.e., he can endure it), then burn him with four cauteries on his shoulders, and one at last to finish burning all over him until he is completely burned off; hold your hand tight.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	 Afterwards take care of him until he recovers, after which you should perform the treatment prescribed by Olius.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	 "In the manner for burning in epilepsy.
Caput XI.	 The head is number 10
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	 Do not burn an epileptic person unless it's for someone whose epilepsy is due to a brain abscess
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	 It is therefore permissible for you to operate on the brain of him first with forceps and also as we have said in healing; when he becomes big or is tolerant towards accepting medications.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	 If the child cannot tolerate medicines, then administer a gargarism and feedings to the brain before that day with many applications of food.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	 Afterwards you must burn him with a cautery on the middle of his head as we have said before; and also one at each corner of his head.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	 If he is big and tolerant of pain, then burn him with cauteries as we have said before in having a paralysis, and also to the neck and shoulders; make the cautery of Olius according to what has been said before.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	 If he is a child, then burn him with an appropriate cautery according to this way.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	 "In the manner for burning in melancholy.
Caput XII.	 "The twelfth head.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	 When the melancholy humors are corrupted by dampness and phlegm becomes thick, at this point it is cautered with Cauteries which we mentioned previously having paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	 And if the melancholy humors are excessive and bring on melancholy, and the body becomes moist, at this point it is given to him in a vessel which cleanses his brain as before mentioned in the process of division: then radiate the head of the sick person, and afterward make a tortellini more gently made from linen just like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	 Then place it in the middle of the heads: and the sick person lying flat holds onto it from all sides with both hands.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	 Then apply the ointment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	 And it is appropriate to use old goat butter.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	 Then warm him with heated embers of moderate heat that the finger can tolerate when introduced into him.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	 Then pour a poultice on his head in a circle and apply it until he is no longer inflamed.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	 He should be treated with this ointment every week as long as the regimen of his benefit continues, until he is cured.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	 Or if a finger prick with multiple punctures is not possible due to the hand being held tight by the cautery, then it should be burnt while smelling of sulfur.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	 This indeed is the species of Cauteries which moistens the brain with its quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	 Then place on top of him a poultice made from goat butter or fat from geese.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aqua descendente ad oculum.	 The manner of Cauteries to be applied by descending into the eye is as follows:
Caput XIII.	 The thirteenth head.
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	 When the beginning of water is introduced to you through signs as mentioned before, then begin and pour it on the sick person while cleansing his head with that which cleanses its head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	 And keep him free from all dampness, and make him to be at rest on a bed during nights and days for some time.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	 Then give it to him so that he may radiate his own head, and cauterize the middle of his head as mentioned before.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	 "At that point, burn it over two coals simultaneously if an incision is made to the descent of water into both eyes at once: or with one torch alone, if there's an incision only to one eye; and cut away all veins and arteries under the skin along its length while cautery remains in place. The blood flow ceases.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	 "If you wish to remove something from it, immediately cut away with whatever medicine is available and I will be there with my knowledge, which includes extracting arteries, cutting them off, and cautioning the flow of blood.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	 "Sometimes when burning a vein inside, there are two outcomes: if one of the torches is extinguished during the process and both fail to ignite, or if one ignites but cannot keep up with the other.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	 "Regarding cautery for the eyes.
Caput XIIII.	 "The twelfth part of it, which is about the head.
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	 "If tears are ancient and dry: the veins of the head are then preserved with superfluity of cold and phlegmatic fluids; at that point burn it over two coals simultaneously, one to preserve the eyes' vein inside (using the same cautery described earlier), and another above both ears, along with a second pair below under the skull.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	 "If it is added to the heat at that point, burn all of its length with a smaller torch above the eyebrows.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	 "Regarding cautery for the fetus's nose.
Caput XV.	 "The fifteenth part, which is about the head of a newborn infant.
Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	 "When you treat this one as described earlier and do not apply a different medicine: then first bind its head with three times to make it stop crying; next burn the middle of its head using that cautery we mentioned previously, along with an additional torch for its nose.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	 "Next burn it over two coals simultaneously above the eyebrows and under them (just a bit).
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	 "And keep an eye on its artery to avoid cutting into it.
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	 This is the shape (or form) of a claw
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	 The method for cauterizing with the help of the Palpebra.
Caput XVI.	 Head XVI
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	 When the Palpebra is mollified by light or moisture, then cauterize it with one small pair of forceps as shown here.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	 And if you wish so, then cauterize him above the two upper teeth with at most two pairs of forceps in every part; and they will be long by two touches: and its length is equal to all cauteries multiplied by the lengths of the upper teeth, subtracted from three times the thumb's length when touched with a pair of forceps.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	 This is the shape (or form) of the second method for cauterizing as shown here.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	 The method of cauterizing with Palpebra when there are many bristles pointing upwards from the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Head XVII
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	 Cautery is done with two methods, either by fire or by a burning medicine (ointment).
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 Cautery with fire is done by preparing an ointment beforehand and applying it to the eye before cauterizing in order to remove his own hairs if they are growing upwards; until they become longer and equalized (in length).
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	 If the bristles are at his own eye, then close them tightly with a wick so that they will not move until they become born (i.e., grow out).
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	 And when they become equalized (in length), then place his head gently into your hands so that you can see their signs with the wax seal; and this is a symbol of the hair.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	 And then pour over him an ointment of milk or egg whites onto his eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then do fire cautery with this shape (form).
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	 And then do the fire cautery with this shape (form) until he has burned all of his flesh that is like a symbol of the dying leaves, completely showing itself.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	 The seal of your surgical procedure is that if you squeeze the eyelid with a probe until it contracts and the hair follicles at the eye puncture are pulled out.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 If once you take away the hand, release it in three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	 Then smear it with a mixture of butter and vinegar until it is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then cure it with oil, so that it heals.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If what you remove from the hair after a certain time has healed and your eyelid has become soft then use a cautery over that spot as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	 If the hair is below (the eyelid), then burn that same place until it moves down to its natural position; and make it so as not to itch when hairs touch the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	 By means of cautery with a medicinal burn in this case.
Caput XVIII.	 The eighteenth head.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 It is so that you get rid of the superfluous hairs and they become equal in time.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	 Turn into paper what was formerly cloth.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	 Then take the soap with knowledge and do not drink it when it is unwashed from one ounce or almost that; then bathe her thusly with a good confession and make it as if she was washed thoroughly so that she should not be defiled.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	 Then take away from the hand and place it on the eyelid of one or two;
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	 And put under the eye the drunk drink mixed with albumin, then your head becomes light.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	 And place the sign of your finger over medicine, and raise it up higher.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	 You moved him to remove as many times as you needed from the medical incision because his wound was like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	 Until then he continued to remove it when he had inflicted himself with the injury; and moved him then away from the medicine as you do your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	 When the incision is quieted (the wound has stopped bleeding), remove the medicine, and close the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	 If you see the eyelid raised (elevated), just as when it is pulled up by fire or with an incision; this is good: and if not then proceed to make that part of your eye healthy by applying medicine in the place where there was no healing, but without any harm - until surgery returns success.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	 Afterwards, put a piece of butter on top of it (the eye) to remove the inflammation.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	 Afterwards apply ointment with another remedy if needed in order for the healing to occur.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	 It is necessary for you during the operation that the last guardian of your eye remains there so nothing can fall out from medicine into it (the eye).
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If the eyelid becomes softened after a day and there is something hanging from its eyelashes that goes into your eye; then proceed to apply medicine on that place where it became soft due to the eyelid itself just as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Afterwards apply ointment until healing occurs.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	 This is the shape of a leaf mold (?).
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	 You know that human eyes differ in size and proportion.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	 Therefore take this into account when doing your work; do not hide the way of rectifying that which is his study in this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	 How to cauterize a fistula (tear duct)?
Caput XIX.	 The nineteenth chapter
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	 When you cure a fistula (tear duct), according to what we said earlier about the divisions of grief; and do not forget your care; then it is necessary for you to cauterize that part in this way.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	 Press gently on his head and place it in your hand; keep his head held between yours so that it does not move around or be carried away with the head
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Afterwards put a piece of fat into his eye socket or over the eyelid; afterwards ignite the cautery (hot iron), whose shape is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	 Put it as gently as if you were touching the end of a quill from one of those pen makers; with this you should cauterize - and if you can get to the other side but cannot reach all the way through then try holding on above where you are.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	 Nevertheless this is better for your work
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	 If the fistula is open, remove it along with its contents and apply a dressing; if not open, then make an incision in that spot to retrieve or obtain it, and after applying a dressing on the wound.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	 Then, place over the wound something which causes burning, such as a cautery.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	 Hold the other hand closer to the cautery near your nose so that it doesn't touch you or become uneasy; place the cautery on the palm of your hand and push down upon it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	 Then if by using the cautery from its beginning up to your mouth will be beneficial
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 If not, then repeat the process one or twice more days later.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a mixture of pitch and ointment to it so that you are cured.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	 If after forty days it does not heal then place over it a sharp corrosive medicine until the opening is cured; and if there are more than one hole apply each to its proper place in that book of yours.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	 There's another way for treating fistulas which some people have mentioned
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	 Place it into that fistula and find the hole; then place over that small slit a subtle thing called a cannula which has this shape.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	 And after you find it in that hole a certain amount of drachma from the liquefied lead and hold tight with a good cannula; and let no one move the patient otherwise or throw the liquefied lead into his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	 And it is necessary to place over the eye that liquid mixture of fish glue or water
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	 Because lead would fill up and close the fistula hole and heal it miraculously.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	 If the fistula is healed with this cautery and treatment then that was good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	 And if not, then it must be administered into the nosehole and reduced to its proper course; according to what is written there itself in that place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	 Cauterizing wounds of the hand
Caput XX.	 20th head
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	 Many accidents occur in the mouth of the hand, which are called the fingers, and especially on the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore if you have wounds, as I mentioned earlier in the division of the bones, and do not apply the cure for wounds with fire, then apply a small flame to the wound in this manner
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	 And gently apply it according to its subtlety
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	 Then place the burning item on top of these wounds, until the cure reaches deep into them.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	 And then apply it with care, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	 Cauterizing wounds of the mouth
Caput XXI.	 21st head
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	 When the mouth is injured at the root of the tongue, or on the palate, or on the roots of the teeth: afterwards it becomes pus, and then dries up: after that it becomes a fistula: therefore cure it yourself, and do not apply any treatment to it, because you must use fire as a cure for wounds in proportion.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	 Then insert the burning item into the fistulas opening, and hold your hand there until you have reached deep into it with the burning iron, then do this thing once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	 And then apply it after that, as I mentioned earlier in the division of the cures.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	 If so, then it is healed, and it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	 And if not, you must remove the place where pus has built up from within your own body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	 Cauterizing wounds of the tongue and teeth softening them
Caput XXII.	 22nd head
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 When the tongue is softened by moisture and teeth are moved around it, and you cure her with medicines, do not apply any treatment to it, then place your head gently into its own mouth.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	 In the meantime, apply a cautery whose shape does not extend beyond this point so that it can be placed over the tooth; and then introduce into it a heated cautery in order to remove from the tooth the putrid matter that has already formed there: and hold your hand steady until you feel the pain subside from the heat of the fire as soon as it reaches the roots of the teeth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	 After applying your hand, apply a second cautery in turn; that is to say
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	 Afterwards the patient spits out his saliva with salt water and holds it for one hour while spitting it back out again; he does this several times in succession.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	 The motion of the tongue becomes firm, the gums are relaxed and become dry, and so is eliminated the moisture that has become corrupted.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	 In order to cauterize a tooth causing pain.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter Twenty-Three
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	 When pain arises from the tooth due to coldness or frostbite itself, or injury to it, and no treatment is provided with medicines; then a cautery must be applied in that place according to two methods: either a cautery with butter, or else one made of iron.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	 The cautery should be applied using butter, so that you apply butter to the point where it is introduced into the ear canal or nose; and this causes a contraction of the vessels.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	 After applying it, hold your hand steady over the extremity being treated.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	 After applying the cautery with butter, place the heated cautery over the pained tooth and hold it until you feel that the pain subsides; then apply another one after a while, so as to remove all the putrid matter from the teeth in succession.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	 And if you feel that it is too cold to use the butter cautery alone or a combination of both hot and cold, apply iron heated as well over the tooth in pain; and hold until the heat reaches the deepest part of the corruption in the teeth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	 The cautery is applied with iron so that you aim it towards the canal or use steel; and this causes a constriction of the vessels.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	 This is a Latin translation of the Arabic phrase "his body has some excess fat such that fire does not burn his nose.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	 Secondly, the cautery tool should have a shape that fits it; place it on his tooth and hold your hand tightly until the cautery is applied.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	 Then do this occasionally, for the pain will be removed either that day or another.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	 And it is necessary to strike him with the cautery tool until he opens his mouth, and hold him tightly for a while; afterwards remove him gently.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	 This is the shape of the cautery tool
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	 Use the cautery tool in whatever way you can; this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	 Cauterizing with a Stropus
Caput XXIIII.	 The head has 24 parts.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	 When the Stropuli are at phlegm and from cold and are not obedient to digestion by mechanics or the digestion of these is more direct; then strike the cautery tool with its shape as follows.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	 Having two open extremities such that smoke may be drawn up to the cautery from one of them; and place it on fire above him for a while; afterwards, if he is unwilling, until he becomes burned at both ends.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	 If the flame is weak, then place the cautery tool according to the quantity of the flame.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	 Afterwards release him three days and put on top of it a new fire until the pain is removed by fire.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	 Afterwards cure him with the ointment of the tooth, until the shape of the cannula heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	 Cauterizing with a poultice and constriction of the throat.
Caput XXV.	 The head has 25 parts.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	 When the humectures are above the airway and especially when it is accompanied by cold complexion, then it must be that he is relieved first with a solution of medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	 "Then cauterize it at the root of the throat, causing depression; and thus prevent bleeding from the cautery, unless he is instructed.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	 "Then cauterize it with another cautery at the junction of the collar bone and the last joint; so that Cautery may be applied as previously.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 "When doing this procedure, keep him until he is cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	 "The cautery shall be applied to the nostrils and nose as well.
Caput XXVI.	 The twenty-sixth part
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	 "When a cold and cough are present in the lungs, and the patient is not feverish or phlegmatic; then cauterize him with two cauteries at the depression of the throat, ears, and eyes.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	 "And another cautery between the two breasts; so that Cautery may be applied as previously.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	 "And if your cautery is with a point; which is called the Point, whose form precedes that of the earache; then there are thirty points from it to another.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 "When doing this procedure, keep him until he is cured.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	 "And there shall be Cautery with three branches; in the manner as follows:
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	 "And when you do this procedure once with two Cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	 The procedure of cautery on the titillus and dislocated arm.
Caput XXVII.	 The twenty-seventh part.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	 "When the attendant's arm is dislocated due to moisture; and not during the return of his own dislocation does it cease until he has become accustomed to its reduction after that, then dislocate with a gentle motion as we have already said.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	 "The patient is placed on his back or side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	 "Then remove the thread which is inside of the titillus and connect it to the left side with your left hand; and if dislocation occurs at that point.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	 "Then a cautery holder is applied with two tweezers.
Cuius forma est haec.	 What shape or form does this have?
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	 This refers to a surgical procedure where the cautery is applied using four pairs of tweezers or forceps for precise control and retraction.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	 Sometimes when a cautery is applied using three pairs of tweezers, the result forms six pairs or eight forceps as there are two in each pair. The tweezers are used to manipulate and control the surgical instrument with great subtlety.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	 This refers to a surgical procedure where three pairs of tweezers are held by an assistant, resulting in six pairs or eight forceps being available for precise control and retraction.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	 Occasionally when one additional pair is added to this setup, there will be a total of eight pairs or sixteen forceps.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	 Then a piece of porous material such as gauze or cloth is placed over the cautery so that blood can escape and control of bleeding is maintained during the procedure.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	 Then apply a soothing ointment to soothe discomfort and prevent sudden movements, ensuring that the affected area does not move too much until it is fully recovered.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	 If a dislocation occurs upwards and rarely happens, then apply the cautery over the dislocated joint with multiple points using forceps or clamps to stabilize it.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	 The wound is sealed up tightly so that moisture does not penetrate and the patient is treated for healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	 The procedure of cauterizing the stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	 When cold and excessive moisture accumulate in the stomach so that it cannot be removed from its own surface without additional help to open up the wound, multiple catheters are added near the wound site for irrigation purposes, ensuring that the patient is properly supported while allowing them to drain fluids out of their body naturally and extend the extremities.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	 Then the cautery is applied with three pairs of forceps or clamps to control bleeding and prevent it from escaping while also using another pair on each side for support, resulting in an overall triangular figure formed by six pairs of forceps or clamps.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	 And stretch the upper extremity so that they do not become entangled when used to apply dressings, bandages, etc.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	 The depth of cutting is equal to three times the thickness of the skin
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	 The second figure of the cauteries is as follows without addition, and if you use a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape; it amounts to one cautery per the figure of the circle according to this shape
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	 If you withdraw from this cautery while holding it in the stomach, it amounts to a mark on top of the stomach according to the quantity that you have with encaustry; then make him bleed with cautery; and finally cure him with a care until he is cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	 How to cauterize Epar
Caput XXIX.	 The 29th chapter
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	 If Epar becomes painful due to cold, dampness, or large weight, until the excess of its natural exit, and it is cured with what we said, and does not fail in him; then let the sick one be supplied over his own head by signs using encaustry three times according to this figure and quantity, and below Epar inferior from hypocondriums where man's cubit has been reached: it amounts to a space between all cauteries per length of fingers, and the second cautery per the right side of the body. And do not squeeze your hand with much cautery.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	 If it is supplied by a thinness of the skin and not increased in quantity, let the sick one stand over his own feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	 If he is not standing, then lie down because he has already extended his limbs and opened his mouth.
Haec est forma cauterii.	 This is the shape of a cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	 And it will be possible for you to cauterize this cautery with an encaustry when your technique and insight into art is good.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	 And be careful so that you do not proceed in cauterization until the entire body has been supplied with a thinness of skin and everything is supplied to it all over, so that he reaches his intestines; for there is a thinness on the skin where it is, therefore let this be done.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	 Of Cauterizing Poxes
Caput XXX.	 Head
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	 If an abscess occurs and you know it is on the skin of Epatis or his garment, then immediately apply cautery to the affected area of Epatis; if it's in the tunic of Epatis, but with pain present: do not let go until the surgeon has attended to him.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	 Therefore, he should raise up his head over the fire or hot object.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 Then apply the abscess with a caustic substance, and when it is burned with heated metal, it will be removed from the body by fire.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is his shape.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	 And when one cautery is applied with him until the entire skin is burned and it falls off, or until all the sores are removed by fire, then he should seek the care of doctors to be healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	 And it is not necessary to apply this kind of cautery unless the study of medicine has been prolonged, and through whose hands these afflictions have come with many experiments: then he may dare to perform this manner of operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	 But it is better for him to dismiss her at my place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	 Of Cauterizing Poxes
Caput XXXI.	 Head
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	 The ancients cautoried the pox of Plagues with the roots of sweet Cicuta in a cold manner as follows:
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	 And it is that you receive from the roots of sweet Cicuta long ones, one longer root which comes out through her and feel as if your finger were swollen.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	 Then immerse her in oil and ignite her on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	 Then apply one cautery between the neck and the head of the body, with two others close to each side under the guide below the chin, which is below the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	 And with two others and also on the one between the fifth and sixth ribs towards the back, and another on the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	 To the fingertips and thumbs: one towards the spatulas on either side of it, and two towards each of the ribs on the chest, below which is between the two spatulas
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	 And you should not apply your hand over the cautery while it is in contact with the skin and causing odor.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	 Some ancients have said that there are people who use the cautery with a similar iron tool and they ignite it, then insert it into where it is between the ribs, until it reaches its opposite end and returns to itself as we mentioned for the thumbhole of Epatis.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	 But with this perforation and cautery there is a fear that either the patient may die immediately or it can cause an injury at the place of the fistulous lesion which has no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	 Method for splaining caput
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	 When you cure spleen ulcers with the method that we mentioned from a cure of spleen ulcers and do not apply your treatment, then the cautery is to be used according to three methods which are all correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	 One of the three ways is to make a three-pronged cautery or four lines along its length following the shape of the cauteries of Epatis, whose foremost figure precedes.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	 And each cautery should have thickness proportional to the digits
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	 The method for cautery is as mentioned before for Epatis.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	 And do not apply your hand over the cautery, and let the patient breathe normally through his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	 Another method for cautery is to have a person holding two tweezers who mentioned in the chapter on dislocated arm; and apply it directly into the spleen where it touched the left cubit of an infirmity: And let you be release according to its length through the body, so that they fall out according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	 Then insert two ignited tweezers until they touch both parts of the skin; then remove it; there will therefore be four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	 If you burn with a different tool than three fingers
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	 After the cautery, if there is any remaining pus in the wound that has not been removed by previous treatments, it will be more difficult to heal than what came before from care and treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	 In order for cautery to work properly
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter 33
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	 Cautery does not fail in hydropathy (a type of medicine) unless it is used improperly.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	 When you apply Hydropicum with the methods of care that we described earlier and if you do not perform a proper treatment, then it is necessary to cauterize him with four pairs of tweezers around the navel, and one on top of the stomach, another above the liver, and others at the back, over the spine between the ribs. And also place one directly under each arm, and the other directly under the stomach: for the depth of the cautery should be very close to where it is applied, so as not to damage the skin
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	 After removing a burned area, pus may take some time to come out.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	 And in addition, after the cautery with him (the burned area): it is necessary to give him two intentions: and he will be healed by God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	 Cautery with that which you will use for the abdomen is to be sharp; and according to its previous form (of another cautery) on his back it should also be sharp.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	 For the feet and hands.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter 34
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	 When you apply Hydropicum and the blood vessels become full of a fluid called citrina, then it is necessary to cauterize the top of the back of the feet between the ear and the anus; and use your hand with the cautery, do not twist his arm like that: after using one hand for him, do not use another one again.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	 The fluid called citrina has been removed and the cautery should be according to this form (of a different cautery).
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	 In order to perform cuts on all areas of the body, a cautery must be prepared with two fingers and heated until it is burning; then apply both to each cut simultaneously and allow them to burn for as long as necessary, after which one should use another cautery that is proportionate in length. One cautery should be placed under the arm, while the other below, moving laterally across the surface of the body at an equal distance from all sides: After this, make a cautery over any vein separately and without waiting too long; so you will have done what we said earlier.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	 In order to perform cauterization using the solution of Viscus.
Caput XXXV.	 The 35th chapter.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	 When the solution of Viscus has been chilled and humidified until it weakens the veins' power to hold and digest, which are in the stomach and intestines; and then cure it with the appropriate methods, but not heal; and when the patient is more tolerant of the painful cautery due to weakness, at that point cauterize him above his belly by a large cautery as before, following what precedes in cauterization on the stomach with a circle cautery, and four cauteries around the navel's sensitive area with a subtle claw cautery; and over the ribs near them, by a great cautery.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	 If you find excessively humid conditions and a patient who is more tolerant of the painful cautery, then at that point cauterize him above his throat with a cautery; and over everything else as well. And if you wish to add two small cauteries above the belly near it in addition to the large one there.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	 The cure is effective, whose application does not err.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	 In order to perform a cautery for hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	 The 36th chapter.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	 When hemorrhoids are old and numerous, or only one, and they come from large amounts of coldness, humidity, or frigidity, then cure them with that as we said in the previous division; but do not apply a curative procedure there. Then cauterize three small cauteries above the lower part of the back beneath by the most triangularly inclined, and also place one cautery below the navel nearly with two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If the stomach of him is tightened and food cannot be digested by it, then make an incision in his face to save his life. Burn a large artery over his stomach and clamp off another one above his spleen after making an incision through it with a smaller needle's eye. Release the first incision after a while: then you will have to cure him as soon as possible.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	 In order to perform the cauterization after making incisions in them
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter 77
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 When you make an incision through the artery that supplies blood to him (arteria capitis), then ignite a cautery over it as soon as possible.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	 After that, introduce the heated cautery into his body through the newly made incision and hold it there until blood flows out of him again: do this once (only once), or twice if necessary.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	 If many incisions are needed, then perform a cautery on each one in the same way as before.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	 After that, cure them while feeding them with oil until they heal.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if you burn him with a large cautery over his stomach, it is worse than the end.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	 In order to perform the cauterization within the fistulas (fistulae) of the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter 88
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	 When a sick person has undergone surgery and is still bleeding because of the incision made there, then burn a cautery over it to stop the blood flow: he will recover with this treatment.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	 After that has happened to someone who had a fistula and it became closed (closed fistulas), pus comes out of it, and the corrupted moisture contaminates everything.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	 Therefore, do what is necessary so that you probe him with a delicate tool to remove the pus inside.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	 After that find out how deep it is when you probe him with a delicate tool.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	 Then ignite the cautery which has been prepared in the same way as before.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	 After that introduce the heated cautery into him through his fistula and find out how deep it is by probing him with a delicate tool.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 Iter over her cautery until every corrupt body is cured once or twice or thrice according to your needs
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	 And guard you from the venom of the ulcers if there is one; either apply a large plaster over her or apply a patch to her fistula at once, whether it's on her nipple or in her intestines, then tend and care for all of them.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	 And do not make this unless there is a fistula present at the place where flesh is; consider it because penetration does not occur.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	 Afterwards, tend to that place until it heals completely
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	 If the place becomes sealed off and materials come away from it, then leave it to its time for a long while; know that he has now completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And if no materials come away from it, then know that he is penetrating or there's a corruption at the mouth of his bowels; or as though something has entered through those, whose remembrance will not be found in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	 The treatment of wounds by Albucasis
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter 39
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 If a pain occurs in the veins from cold or from great suffering and the wound is small because of it, then you must apply cautery to him above all of them on top of the veins, using cauterizing iron over each vein with caution until its healing is completed.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	 And we may cauterize it a second time at his own request.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	 Where three lines are given.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	 Therefore the last one was added to the healing.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	 The treatment of wounds by Albucasis
Caput XL.	 Chapter 40
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	 When weakness occurs in the bladder and the cold goes to it with dryness of urine and humidity, until he does not hold back his urine; then you must apply cautery at the base of the male genitals above the vagina where the hairs of the penis begin, using cauterizing iron on the right side of the testes and another on the left one. And the length of that cautery should be in proportion to the number of fingers: and apply cautery below the abdomen either once or twice if you fail; according to what comes before it with a patch.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	 Of the method for cauterizing the matrix
Caput XLI.	 Head Chapter 1
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	 When a fracture or excessive moisture occurs within the matrix and it is forbidden to be contaminated with any impurities, and menstrual discharges occur along with these things, and the procreative act of theirs occurs, and then pain strikes when they arrive at their destination, so that he must cauterize them in three places around the belly button using a pair of tweezers as we described for cauterizing the vagina, or with two pairs of tweezers.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	 Of the method for cauterizing an anchor in dislocation
Caput XLII.	 Head Chapter 2.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	 When mucosal moisture occurs to the anchor and causes death at its location, that is when they approach each other; and his sign is when it extends above one of them when they are facing.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	 Therefore it is recommended that the weak one be cauterized above the anchor's pixel using a similar circle of tweezers after you have signed with the charcoal inside its circumference as we mentioned earlier; and so that he falls into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	 And let his form precede that of the stomach's cautery.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	 If this cautery is not present to you at that time, then cauterize him with three pairs of tweezers along with a deep cautery as mentioned earlier; and let the depth of the cautery be proportional to the thickness of all skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then cure him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	 Of the method for cauterizing sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	 When sciatica occurs to a limb, and if it is not cured by a single pair of tweezers alone; then he must be cauterized with three pairs of tweezers.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	 When pain strikes the anchor's pixel and there are causes of his cold and moisture; then the weak one is cured with him as we described earlier in two ways, and not by treatment alone, it fades away; so that he must be cauterized for this by either strong pills or artificial ones.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	 In such case, the appropriate translation would be "Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	 The method of cautery is divided into two ways: first, with the use of medical instruments such as needles and hooks; second, by using fire or heat.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	 "The method of cautery involving fire includes many variations.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	 One way to perform cautery is by using a triangular hook on the three points of an arrow or dart aimed at the part requiring treatment.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	 And it may be done with good effect, or bad effect.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	 The space between all cautery is measured by the digits of quantity; and one-way cautery may exist.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	 When cautery occurs at the top or middle of an arrow, it can be difficult to treat.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	 There are four types of cautery: first, cutting with a knife; second, burning with fire; third, pricking with needles; and fourth, drawing blood by a tube or lancet.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	 If you use a circle as your cautery tool, the shape of it will be like the dislocation of an arrowhead; one way to do this is by making a circle that holds all three points together tightly.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	 And burn away completely the skin's thickness.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	 This is how to perform cautery for sciatica when pain extends from the affected point but does not reach down to the buttocks and legs.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	 However, if the pain extends down to the buttocks and legs, then you should use a hook made of four fingers as well, aiming at the point where the patient complained of pain; this way your cautery will be applied with four fingers in place, making it an effective treatment for that area.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	 The depth of cautery is measured by the thickness of the skin being treated.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	 If the patient had complained of pain reaching nearly to their toes, then you should use a hook aimed at the location where he initially used it, using one or three or four or more hooks as needed for treatment.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	 If the pain is felt below both the knee and the thighs, then you should use one hook to treat that area.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	 In every cautery you undergo, to the extent that no more than necessary and immediately required for the bleeding or artery opening is used, it should not be applied to a large artery, nor attached to an injury that may cause harm, nor by way of constriction
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	 I have heard that one or more people applied a cautery above the artery and then suffered a hemorrhage due to its application, and their foot was cut through completely, and they died as a result of this occurrence.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	 If there is pain in both parts simultaneously, apply the cautery to each one according to that manner.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	 Some wise people said that a cautery anchor should be used for cautery, because it is its mode (way or method).
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	 You should use a hook shaped like iron, whose diameter is proportional to the palm of your hand; and at its opening you should apply it according to the thickness of the fingers, either by covering more or less in proportion; and into that hook insert another one as well
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	 The space between all hooks should be measured by the number of fingers; and the openings on both sides are to have a height like a finger or two fingers; so that you may attach them more firmly with an iron hook into those hooks.
Et haec est forma eius.	 This is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	 After that it becomes heated by fire until it is reduced to ashes; then it should be placed on a sick foot with an anchor firmly in place above the healthy limb.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	 Then apply three round hooks into his wound, one at a time.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 After that you should remove him from the hooks for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	 Afterwards place a layer of butter; and remove open wounds with many applications.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 After that you should care for him with oil until he is healed
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	 So here ends the chapter on cautery by Albucasis; for his sons use is limited because of their fear from its sight and also due to very few who have succeeded above it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	 Certainly. Here's a possible translation of this Latin phrase into English: "Indeed, one who has been trained with good surgical tools will find his way to the desired location.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	 "With medical instruments one can make two holes to penetrate an arrowhead, so that the door of his house may be opened by air or iron; and they are able to reach it through both holes at a height of two steps above.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	 "The space between the two quantities of the fingers should be equal in width; and both lower and upper openings should exist; and it may surround itself according to this shape.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	 "Then place that on a small anchor, gently holding its top towards the right side of your hand.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	 "Hold tightly with your left hand upon the small anchor.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	 "Then take the warm water that is heated with fire and has a similar warmth to it; hold onto it for an appropriate amount of time; then let the sick person bite into it, so that he may be burned just as if by fire, until he becomes quiet.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 "Then take your hand with the instrument and pour cold water onto it completely from a vessel filled with sweet water; then let that go for two days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	 "Then put above it butter and continue to remove the soot until it is completely removed; let that go for a few days; and then apply the oil.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	 "It is indeed the end of our discussion.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 "Then care for it with oils until it is cured.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	 "If the pain extends to your elbow or shoulder; make him stay in it as long as you kept water at equal distance from both sides.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	 "This is how warm water should be described; and I have written this down in the book on medicine.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	 "You should pour it onto the left and right hands equally; put that into a new vessel with an opening at its lower end only slightly larger than one finger's radius of the hand on which you will be stirring; put another vessel underneath, but also make sure to pour from both vessels onto your hand in equal amounts. After you have squeezed it tightly by compressing your left and right hands together, remove that container until water from an acute downward portion of a third vessel touches your elbow.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	 In such a case you should collect all of it (the water) and place it over another stone or hard object until it is returned to its original state
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	 This stone (or hard object) will be strong and effective when it is used for the collection of water during medical operations or in the process of closing up wounds after surgery.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	 Because its use brings about a healing effect due to fire.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	 And from these medicines are used as well when they're being burned with a strong fire (i.e., cauterization), and just like this one here too, and also with the ashes of wood ash mixed in with soap, so that both may be combined equally.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	 And Galenos told the story of a certain man who was treated by this cure in ancient times and it relieved the pain of his ankle and foot; so that he was greatly pleased with its effectiveness.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	 And he said this because it was not suitable for any other treatment and that he had been cured with just one application of its remedy, until it had been used inside the ear canal again; from which point onwards he became healthy once more.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	 And it is so that if one takes from the seath-ring remedy; and if not used with a man's urine, then it should be dried in the sun until it becomes dry as a powder: and apply it to the sore place where there is pain, either on the ankle or the knee. It should be tied tightly together and can be applied three times per day according to how much the patient feels soothed by the heat of the fire.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	 And then apply it inside his ear canal.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	 After this, tie him down and place him on a bed or chair until he is asleep.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	 The pain has been relieved, and so it was healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	 And know that he should not be burned with these medicines unless after the body is completely emptied of its own fluids first.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	 And Dioscorides said that the goat's skin when it is burned with just one application to a sciatic pain, cured him; and its use was according to this method only.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	 A tendon is placed over a deep groove that runs between the heel bone and toes; it is located above the tendons of the fingers and toes.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	 Then take a dry twig (of a goat) and burn it over a fire until it becomes charcoal; after that make the charcoal into powder.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	 After that place it on the tendon and remove it, then let it be extinguished (i.e., burn off).
Deinde itera illud.	 Then do this again.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	 Do not stop doing that until the pain stops (i.e., continue to apply it as long as you feel any pain).
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	 And this mode of treatment is called a cautery (lit: burning tool or instrument) by the Arabs, referring to their use of fire for cauterizing wounds
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	 The method of applying it until you are free from pain
Caput XLIIII.	 It's a capital (i.e., 14).
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	 When pain is caused by multiple causes or accidents, or by cuts, bruises, or the removal of excessive fluids, and similarly from infusions with cold and wet materials; but this cautery only remains if it was made through an infusion of frigid matter alone.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	 Therefore, after the removal of foetal pills and similarly for them to be above the back when pain is there (i.e., three lines in a semicircle), until signs with wax are placed on every five lines of the cautery or more according to their number; then let it be called a cauterization if done punctually with a cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	 If three or four cauteries are used and the middle one has been heated, then do it in this manner.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	 The mode of cauterizing for Gibbus (the term seems to be a name for an Arabic region or country).
Caput XLV.	 It is 15.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	 Many injuries happen through this with infants.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	 The sign of its injury is on the infants; that was caused by a stricture in his throat while he was being fed and a blow: then it entered into the last part of his back (i.e., the heel bone) between the toes, which has begun to rise above the remaining parts of his legs.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	 As soon as you understand this thing and know how to do it, then burn him with a cautery made in the shape of a circle according to that form
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	 Spread the cautery evenly over all parts of him and burn through it equally; if you're using a cautery with points on both ends, make two lines or three: also have the dots close together
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	 Afterwards, wait until he is cured as we said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	 Do not administer the cautery to an excessive extent that might lead to a spasm of the nerves.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	 Cautery for treating podagra and joining up pain.
Caput XLVI.	 End of text.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	 When the pains of joints are caused by cold and dampness that penetrate any part of the body, then when they occur in the feet, according to medical custom it is called Podagra specifically.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	 As soon as cured of podagra by cold causes and a cure with the methods of curing, the pains will not remain, but the cautery will remove them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	 And it is that the cautery be applied after the application of a binding mixture around the feet with many cauteries; also known as Ollie's Cautery.
Cuius haec est forma.	 What follows?
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	 If you want to make points on the face of the foot then burn with a cautery along with the points
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	 If the pains ascend up to the knee or from any joint and there are many casualties, then apply a cautery over all the joints of each limb with three or four cauteries across it according to this same method as Clauilius does.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 If you need more of that cautery then burn him (the patient).
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	 Do not hold your hand with the cautery for too long as it may damage only the skin sores
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	 If the pains ascend up to the knee and back then administer what we said using a cautery on his cheek or brow.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	 When pain is confined to a single limb, then you must strike with a sharp blow as if you were striking two strings of an instrument.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	 If the pain extends to the fingers, then strike them all at once with a sharp blow as if you were striking one point over every knot and another point over the chin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	 If the pain extends to the elbows or shoulders after a day, then cauterize both simultaneously from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	 And do not neglect any sick person nor a patient's needs for treatment.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	 If the regimen is good and helps clear the phlegm and heals with God's help by applying cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	 On how to perform cautery in Ruptures (ruptured vessels).
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter 77, the end of the first book of the surgical textbook by Albucasis.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	 When a rupture occurs in the groin or abdomen and descends into the bowels, either to the testicles or the anus, it is approaching; at this point you must immediately give food to the patient the next day with appropriate treatment.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	 And if he becomes weaker from severe illness as he descends into his belly, then you should make use of gentle remedies that will bring him back up from his belly to your hands.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	 Then let him lie between your hands on his back and gently hold it until he returns to consciousness or the bowel appears; whichever comes first.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	 Then take it gently between your fingers and signs with the wax over the rupture above the nostrils as if you were drawing a circle around the upper part of the body from side to side; but also on one hand, draw an identical sign alongside the other hand so that they meet at the top of the head.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	 Then strike with fire to seal it; when this is done let him come out and take his food.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	 And then you reduce the bowels or the bowel into your possession as appropriate treatment.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	 Then lay your hand on the place to prevent him from defecating; and you have already applied a poultice between his hands that he holds onto it while another one is above his chest and another one over his chin as he holds onto it with both hands,
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	 Then apply a cautery over the signature using your thumb with the cautery still straight
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	 Hold tight to it until you have finished applying it or another place if need be, and do not use it again unless you previously used it with the same thumb on its first application.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	 Be cautious while applying the cautery to the intestines during a surgery or procedure, so as not to burn it; instead, let it be placed over the patient's body near death or great evil.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	 You know that if you do not succeed in applying the cautery to the signature, then cancel your operation.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	 The cautery for infants should be subtle and according to their measurement or size.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a cream with the cautery until it heals.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	 The patient will be laid down on their back for forty days after the signature has been taken.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	 It is necessary that you place nourishment for him according to the length of his cure and the duration of his treatment so that he does not lose weight or suffer from exhaustion due to indigestion or constipation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	 Then after forty days the patient will be given a stronger ligature for ten more days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	 There will also be a reduction in work and increase in food, drink, and the voice of those who eat it.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	 When this regimen is used, then healing will occur with whole heart.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	 And I say that the cure for Ruptures should be with an incision on his head.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	 If Ruptures occur in the other parts of his body and are starting to come out but you do not want them to be added, then cauterize him with a round cautery according to its quantity; let it happen as if it were on the third time for him.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	 Then apply this cure and do not add anything else to it.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	 Some people said that Ruptures should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	 After the incision is made with a cautery, and another line is applied at right angles to it from the superior tear above and inferior below
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	 Place your hand in the middle while using the cauterizing tool (clavius).
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	 The first is more easily and effectively used.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	 Cautery should be applied when there is pain from a cut or when striking with a mallet (percussio).
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter 80.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	 When pain occurs due to a case or a blow (percussio), and the suffering continues for a long time without relief through medicines: then it is necessary to cauterize using a cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	 The cautery should be of all sizes proportionate to its strength and usefulness, its weakness, its disability, its usefulness, its torsion and pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	 If therefore healing comes through the use of a cautery first, then it is good (optimum).
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	 Otherwise, proceed to another cautery.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	 Because of the custom among people that they are changed from one member to what suits them better.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Therefore, it is necessary for those in pain to be treated with a cautery until they recover.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	 Cautery should only be applied in Leprosy (Leprae).
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter 90
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	 Leprosy is sometimes treated with the most extensive use of a cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	 The particular type of Leprosy that occurs due to the decay of blood and melancholy must be considered when treating with a cautery.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	 If Leprosy is not cured due to the cautery alone and does not subside or heal, do not give up: continue with additional cauterizations above his head in five places as described here (in Chapter 90), one on the forehead, two over the ears, another at the back of the neck near the chin, the fifth behind.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	 "Lastly take your hand with a cautery tool, until the impression is made on the nostril and it will be dislocated from there, freeing up expiration of the breath in that manner, also cauterize using the cautery over him so as to stop bleeding.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	 "The Leprosy has already spread over the sick one and is visible; it must be cautorized using these cauteries that we mentioned in regard to the head, and a cautery on each nostril, two over both nostrils, six over the vertebrae, and one above the heel-bone, one above him. Over the elbows there are two, one over every elbow, two over the upper arms, two over the shoulders, and two over the chest, and a cautery over every joint, using the hand of your fingers, and foot of yours; also a cautery over every ankle of yours, six over the vertebrae of the back. One above him.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	 "And cauterize your nostrils that are above the heel bone so as not to burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	 "Sometimes when cautering over the nose and mouth of the stomach is done, another above the esophagus, and another above the epiglottis.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	 "You know that when there are more cauteries, it is also more painful and exhausting.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	 "You know that the sick person did not feel pain from cautery as they do normally because their body is already weakened.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	 "It should be a cautery in magnitude and according to the parts of the body, and also with regards to joints.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 "After that, cure the cautery using flour and honey, until it is cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	 "That's how to cauterize.
Caput L.	 "Head of A.L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	 "If a member is stunned and is not cured using medicine, oil, plaster, and the cautery does nothing, then cauterize it in that member.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	 "Make a small hole for the firebrand [cautery] within and place it between the fingers.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then apply oil to the cautery until healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	 If the firebrand causes numbness or paralysis of the fingers and toes when applied to some part of the body, then it will be removed from that place by movements of the limb; and the numbness will be relieved.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	 Indeed this should not be applied over anything unless one is wise about the anatomy of the limbs, and by movements of the nerves can body move out.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	 By using cautery as prescribed by Albucasis.
Caput LI.	 The head, L.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	 If Albucasis says that something is not to be found in the cautery of Albaras by way of medical arts; then cauterize deeply into that cautery parumper and wait until the color has been removed, after which its appearance will change as well.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	 Then apply flour mixed with herbs and oil, lentils mixed with rose water, leaves of the hyacinth [Hyacinthus] mixed with columbine blood (columbine is a type of flower), and hyacinth blood mixed as well; from all this will be one part. Mix these things together and let them run over the wound until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	 By using cautery in Cancer.
Caput LII.	 The head, II.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	 When Cancer is beginning to happen and one must hold him; then cauterize him with a circle of cautery in the circle around his body as it was done before.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	 The wise ones said that cautery should be applied last to the middle of the firebrand.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	 I do not understand this; because of my fear that it will become a sore, and I have already heard about that from someone else before.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	 Indeed, when the firebrand is placed around its own circle like we said before; or by many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	 By using cautery for Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	 The head, III.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	 When someone has an abscess and it is ripe for incision or excision, perhaps due to a lack of resources or advanced age, if the patient is already impoverished and lacks sufficient blood, or perhaps because time is running short, then in such a situation one should cauterize that abscess with heated iron rods puncturing the abscess several times.
Deinde dimitte eam.	 Then let it go away
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	 And will continue to swell
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	 If instead one makes a hole in it with an iron tool as depicted below...
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	 ...then remove the abscess from its center and let it drain through a hole made with an iron tool; so that any pus in it may be purified as much as possible.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	 And once the hole is made, then cure him/her immediately.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	 In order to cauterize with a corroding iron tool.
Caput LIIII.	 The head of LIIII.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	 A corroding iron tool can only cause rot or destruction if it is applied to a swollen member; but he who was corrupted by fire became like wood that had been consumed by fire.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	 If therefore you want to apply the corroding iron tool where it may be accepted by fire and thus cause many burns with a large number of irons puncturing that place where corrosion occurs,
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	 Then one should burn him/her from all parts until the rot is completely removed and nothing remains of it except the wound itself.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	 Then let him/her go without food for three days and apply sulfurous treacle with oil to the places of the cautery until all sores are removed completely and no corruption remains anywhere.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	 And then cure him/her with various ointments made from animal fat.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	 Therefore if after three days the body is born again healthy and free of corruption, that's a good thing.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	 Then apply more cautery to the place where some corruption remains after all sores have been removed.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	 The corroding iron tool is sometimes used in conjunction with an acute medication.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	 An abscess appears where the cautery has been applied
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	 However, the cautery with fire has caused a wound; and I myself have said that cauterization should be done together with acute medicine in division: take it therefore there when it is ready
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	 Cauterize the nail or wart
Caput LV.	 The skull
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	 Many wounds have occurred on the soles of the feet; there is a large one, leaking, which affects the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	 The cautery can also be done with warm water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	 When done with fire, the cautery must be applied in a similar manner to that of removing a piece of flesh from the hand: it should be done as if using iron, proportional to how much charred cloth is removed all at once: and there will be a fine border.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	 After this, place the burned clot on top of the cloth.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	 After this, take your hand with the cautery towards the circumference of the cloth, until it reaches the depth of the cloth; and then release the cautery in three days, until the discharge starts emitting pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	 After this, place a bandage over him with salt-soaked strips; and then remove it from over him at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	 This one will be removed by its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 After this, apply ointment to the affected area of flesh until it is cured.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	 If it does not happen as desired; many wounds occur on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet; then you administer the cautery with warm water; there will be a cannula from the air or iron or from a piece of flesh: and place it on top of the cloth.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	 After this, squeeze the cannula with a small amount of water; hold your hand tight and you pull it back towards yourself with a compression of your hands stronger, until there is a border to the root of the cloth: and the hot water will go deep, to the roots of the cloth: and expect weakness more than over the hour when a hot water border is applied.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	 Therefore remove it (the abscess), since its roots are removed
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	 It is spread to one person after another, until everyone who comes into contact with them has become infected with the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	 Once it has been removed (the abscess), then cure those that have come into contact with it; and when they generate flesh from the unguents
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	 Cautery by fire
Caput LVI.	 The 60th head
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	 If a seizure occurs when someone is struck by the tremor from cold or feverish illness or any other such thing; then he must be cautorized with four cauteries at once, either four above the neck (four in the region of the brain) or five upon the back of the spine and between all of them on the backbone itself, as well as within his heart by another cauterization. And over him, too, there should be a cauterization; so that he may not die from the disease.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	 The seizure ceases with cautery and health returns to the sick one (from cold).
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	 Cautery by Albathir.
Caput LVII.	 The 70th head.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	 When the food of Albathyr (i.e., boils) is expelled from within the body; that is, when pus forms on materials which are corrupted and rotten.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	 Therefore first they should be cautorized (treated) on every head separately with a subtle cautery using wood which is charged with fire; the end of this wood being applied with fire as well.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	 Or with the root of a long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	 Or with a subtle cautery made from lenticels (lenticles) or small twigs.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	 And when they are treated (i.e., cured) by cautery and the excess is removed as I have said; so that they become healthy again.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	 However, it must be done after expulsion with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	 Cautery by the flow of blood out from an artery into a vein.
Caput LVIII.	 The 80th head.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	 Many times the flow of blood from an artery that had been cut and was outside or near to a vein; it could happen by cutting oneself with sharp instruments, or by cautery on the member itself; such things cause difficulty in removing him (i.e., the blood).
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	 "Then, if the needle passes through to that place where your hand is placed over the opening of an artery and you put forth your finger there: then grasp it firmly with both hands until blood comes out of it; otherwise, do not let go.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	 Then take a large oil lamp and set the wick on fire with it; then blow out the flame by holding it above what you are aiming at until the flame goes out.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then take one of them - a small one or a large one depending on the location where the artery has been cut and place the cautery over that spot immediately after you have removed your finger; then hold it until blood stops flowing from there.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	 If you expel the needle along with your finger from the opening of an artery and extinguish the cautery, then take another one immediately after extinguishing it; from the cauteries that have been prepared by fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Do not do this with just one other one until blood stops flowing.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	 And if you touch the inflamed wound nearby and apply another cautery to it instead.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	 And you know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to remove it; especially if the artery is large unless you use four methods at once.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	 Or with a cautery as we mentioned before.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	 Or with extraction when it is not possible to remove the object.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	 If an object is extracted out of them (the fingers), their extremities are cramped and blood stops flowing from there.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	 Or tied with a strong thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	 Or placed upon it medicines to stop the bleeding and tie it down using an appropriate constriction of veins so that it does not become loose or fall off.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	 Whoever administers the excision with a ligature, and a tie down using cloth or something else, or by placing things on top of it, he should not apply excessive pressure to prevent pain unless very rarely necessary.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	 If the person to whom that is done does not have a physician at hand and no medicine: then let it be placed over the opening of the vein in question as we described before, and by constriction of his own veins until blood stops flowing above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	 The finger is not removed immediately upon contact with cold water; it remains frozen for a long time and becomes swollen, hard, and falls off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	 In the meantime you should examine whether there was an injury or some medicine that caused this condition.
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	 The end of the first part
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	 Chapter 2: On Surgery
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	 Chapter 2: Of incisions, perforations, and phlebotomies of veins, and the like
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	 I am the tenth book of Albucasis and my purpose is to explain everything about cautery in medical practice.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	 And placed here chapters up to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	 I proceed through this chapter with the same path, so that he may be relieved of whatever was asked for him.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	 And before beginning this chapter, it is necessary that you know the offspring of what was mentioned in Chapter 1 on cautery, as it should be a warning to them.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	 And for this reason it is necessary that the caution be more severe, because in operation which takes place here there are many deaths of people from bleeding and all other causes mentioned earlier.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	 I warn you that if something like this happens to any of you, then when they fall into the same art with the weakness of people, there can be death too.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	 From these is he who becomes angry with his own pain and death occurs from him through the severity of this and the length of it, as a result of its bitterness.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	 And when there are pain and fear that mean death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	 From these is he who gives himself over to his own pain and says it with him, hoping for healing but the severity of his pain is harmful.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	 "You should treat him with kindness who has come among you from those people whose method is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	 Your caution must be greater than your desire and your greediness
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	 Do not boast over anything from him unless after certain knowledge that would have benefited you in the successful outcome which occurred because of his method.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	 You should apply your skills to the care and management of all the sick people's health, using predictions and indications as needed for what is more beneficial for their welfare.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	 That man among you shall be your teacher in acquiring fame and glory, memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	 The God inspired you sons, his mind and gave no guidance or suggestions to you because it was only in his own hand that this happened
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	 I have also given you this chapter distinguishing it by the chapters of Cautery as far down to your feet so that you may know what is to be done from him and what benefits you.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	 Of the care of waters which are gathered up among children
Caput I.	 Chapter 1
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	 Remember that this illness has often struck children at birth or when the mother's womb is tight without release.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	 And also when it occurs from an obscure cause which cannot be known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	 I did not find this disease to be as severe in others than in children, and death came upon everyone who was affected by it; for that is why I wish to withdraw the use of my treatment from them.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	 I also knew of a child whose head was bound with water and it was adorned with beauty every day until he could not stay upon himself because of the greatness of his head; and dampness increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	 And this disease also appears when moisture gathers between skin and mouth or beneath bones above the nose.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	 The operation on that should be performed when there is moisture between the skin and mouth or beneath the bones above the nose; it must occur so that a cut made at the top of the head in breadth occurs, and its length should be like two fingers until the dampness runs.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	 This is the form of a sponge
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	 If therefore humidity increases more, and the sponge becomes larger, then make two cuts along this shape
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	 And if humidity is below bone and its sign shows that the corners of your head are open on all sides; water will descend when you compress it with your hand to the inside, but not be hidden from you: then you should find three cuts in the middle of the top of the head, as shown.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	 After cutting out the humidity
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	 Then tie up the cuts with gauze and cotton.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	 Then wrap it over with wine, oil, and olive oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	 After that, remove the bandage and care for wounds along with linen and ointment.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	 And do not tie up your head in an uneven manner.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	 And make sure to keep the body as dry as possible and use any available moisture until the member is comfortable and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	 Another way of cutting it is that you consider where the size of the sponge becomes visible and collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	 Sometimes when there are cuts on one side or another, or in both hands/arms.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	 Therefore ascend with the incision where you see the sponge and pull out water; then it will be done in a way that is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	 And be careful not to cut the artery and cause blood flow stoppage; or else the member may die from that loss of fluid with the removal of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	 Of the cuts in arteries which are behind ears.
Caput II.	 The head (second part).
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	 If cuts occur on the eye or nose and become infected; then more than ever is the final care for it as a last resort, cutting of both arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	 Therefore when you see that he has cut them to remove his own head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	 Then cover the place with a bandage so that the arteries are visible.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	 "Then he ties his own arm with a bandage.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	 "And then he considers where to apply the bandage.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 And his two hands are tied behind his ears and are rare unless some men have them.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	 "Then he puts a bandage made of wax on both his hands and smashes them with nails or picks up the corners to remove it from his face, inserting it through the slit in the back of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	 "And if he is lying down, he puts a bandage made of wax under his arm and cuts it off above with an incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	 The length of the incision should be as close to two fingers joined together as possible.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	 "When one is cut open, blood flows out through a narrow slit that runs up the center of his body.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	 If an artery is not visible to him (the surgeon), then he should measure from the ear how far three fingers would be apart and insert the bandage at that distance into his body.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	 "Then he puts a bandage made of wax all the way up to his nose.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	 The object that should be emitted with blood is six finger-breadths and at most it can be emitted from him more than or less than this.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	 "That bandage should always be placed in accordance with the amount that is visible to you through your examination and pressing on his arteries, as much or more than this.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	 "Then he considers where to remove it from the nose.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	 "Then if anything remains at his nose after having removed the bandage made of wax, then he cuts it off and ties up that part of the face with linen.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 "And then he applies a treatment by anointing him with oil until he is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	 "In the extraction of arteries, which are located behind his ears.
Caput III.	 Chapter three
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	 "When a man has an old or acute catarrh of the ears due to acrimonious moisture and coldness of the lacrimal canals, or due to soda or other things that irritate him (the surgeon), he must be treated with medical methods, without causing any harm: then we are skilled in his treatment of extracting arteries from behind his ears, as we have been taught.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	 The method of removing ears is as follows: first, the surgeon severs the hairs which are within a certain time limit and aims for an artery which lies close to it
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	 The pulse test is performed on you by means of your own pulse and is rare unless only a few men are involved or there is coldness causing it.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	 If the pulse test shows that you should be examined by an attendant with a cloth to remove fear and apply it gently.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	 Or if there is warmth in place after removing the cloth then immediately show your face for immediate inspection.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	 Then take it gently as I made before a short time ago
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	 Afterwards wash with that cloth in a hurry until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	 Afterwards remove it quickly and take it out to the top part until you pull it off from your skin, then tie it up securely below that with whatever is under it on all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	 If the artery is shallow then immediately take it out quickly with your nail.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Afterwards cut off a piece as large as the parts of his extremities and tie them together securely so that no blood flows through it.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	 If not cut off or removed then there will be no bleeding from the artery.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	 Afterwards wash with water until you reach 6-3-
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If the artery is large then you must tie it with two or three ropes, firm and strong, from either a cord or a strip so that no blood flows through after tying, to prevent decay of the flesh before healing wounds and to ensure no blood flow.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	 Afterwards cut off any excess between two ropes.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	 Do this during that time or at another time.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	 And if you wish then sear it with a cautery until reaching the mouth using a cautery and tie it up securely once his extremities are cut off to ensure its location for that purpose.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	 And if the surgeon is ill or the face becomes red then a better method must be used.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	 Because of the cautery is from those who go to end the dampness
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	 Therefore it's better
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	 After extraction of arteries, let there be placed on an old vein and put the pulp down gently on top of it
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	 And after curing with dry medicines which cause to be born meat, and with vinegar until they are cured.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If during the operation there was a sudden bleeding from an artery, then immediately apply it with a cautery or else take out what you have grasped and stop the blood with vinegar.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	 If nothing is present among these things to you at this time, then put your finger over the place and until the blood freezes.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	 And cover it with cold water and let it cool down and be bound as needed.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	 And that which is better and easier to remove from the artery is with a cautery holding two hooks together so that both their sharpness are equal in strength.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	 However, smaller knives have less force than two hooks.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	 Because if they are sharp like the two hooks, it is equally to each side so that they do not cut through meat with pressure.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	 Therefore there is some excess of fat and heat in them and they are burned with fire or else the meat is cut off quickly, but because of this therefore it's better for all operations and more so.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	 And place what is between two hooks the size of your fingers after you put both places with encaustic wax and leave them to burn until they come out at their own mouth, or else cut off one in two different places so that it can be stretched as long as it extends from his extremities.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	 Because the pain is not relieved with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	 This is how the cautery works.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	 On curing of tears from eyes.
Caput IIII.	 Caput IV
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	 When there are excessive tears and the course of them is from within the ears, which are over the outer sides of the head's skull; and nothing was done for their cure with medicines, but they see a reddening in front of themselves: and it feels a movement on its forehead like that of scraping off scabs: and their eyes become moist, as if corroded by corrosion. And the eyelashes of them are heated from excessive tears, then those who were treating them did so through this operation, and called it treatment, using "Ensay".
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	 It is also that the very hairs on their forehead may be removed by a certain ailment/disease
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	 Then there are three cuts equally spaced horizontally across the forehead; and their length is nearly equal to two fingers' breadth each, one cut being midway along the nasal bone: another cut following just behind the motion of tears: the third cut at a part which is opposite from the second: then come blood vessels on both sides: and stretch your hand out by the length of both lower jaws. The total amount of all incisions is three fingers joined together, so that you may take sponges or many cloths soaked with blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	 Then introduce sharp pointed sticks in pairs to which their form follows.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	 From the cut at the part of the ear to the second one: and shave with that all the way through to the cut between two incisions, up towards the nose.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	 Then do this as well from the middle cut to the second one.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	 Then remove that with a pair of sharp sticks and introduce the same cutting tool again for the first cut from another part which is not pointed: but use an actual cutting tool for removing from another part which is pointed.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	 Then he puts the cutting tool into their ear with flesh on one side and then removes it leaving only the nose for them to pull out; and then pushes him towards the middle cut, until they reach that which appears from the flesh: except when there is a cut all the way up to where we see something coming.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	 In the middle of a wound until another cut is made
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	 After the flow of blood becomes equal to that expressed through the coagulated wounds, express it from the severed vessels with forceps
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	 Then apply a bandage over all the cuts made and bind it firmly to the severed vessels with sutures; and press upon it a mixture of powdered alum, vinegar or acetic acid.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 And be sure that the cold compresses are not too cold.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	 On the third day use a ligature and administer an infusion of warm water several times.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	 Then apply that with the ointment of the basilisk [a healing ointment made from various herbs] to all those in need; and let them gradually heal.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	 For eye drops, nose drops, and throat drops applied from the inside of the head [the sinuses].
Caput V.	 Head V
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	 When someone has a sudden attack of the eyes and nose drops, and in his aspect there is a weakening; and the eyelids are ulcerated, the hairs fall off from them, and at that place [the head] there is an acute pain, severe, and the result thereof: then remove these things which have been mentioned, as they will not come through any other means but by many vessels.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	 And the cure for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	 So that you may strongly pull at your face.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	 Then make one incision in the middle of your face, or slightly higher and to the right; and begin with a cut at the left side of the nose until you reach the mouth. And stretch out your hand towards the lips, which move during mastication: until you have reached the mouth. When you have reached it, you will extract all the blood through a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	 Then make an incision between the lips with old linen or with linen cloth.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then bind a bandage over it and press upon it a mixture of powdered alum, vinegar, or acetic acid to prevent cold from causing shock.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	 When it has warmed up and you see that the tip of the hook is ready to be inserted into flesh (carp), then it should be removed from water so that it may begin to grow inside the flesh
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	 Then take care of it while you are regulating the heat so that it makes flesh grow (carp): just as if you were to pull apart two parts from a mixture of wheat flour and four parts from colophonium, and prepare an implement using those parts, and administer them in order to bring the meat into being on these hooks.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	 Take care of it when it has fallen down inside the hook (carp).
Caput VI.	 The sixth part is the head, which contains two cavities: one for air and one for water.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	 Everything that falls down inside the hook (carp) is divided into four species: a mineral stone or a pebble like iron; earth and water are also included in this category: anything that comes from plants, such as wine from grapes, bread made of wheat; water itself, as well as vinegar.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	 Therefore when a mineral stone falls inside the hook (carp), or if there is no addition to its species so that it does not grow within the hook, just remove the hook from water and observe whether you see a pebble: in such a case distill something from olive oil, or sesame seed.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	 Then administer the extraction of it and make it grow with care, and pull up the nostrils towards the entrance of the nose after placing a hook (carp) on the ears, or wool, and raise the hook to its highest point.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	 Many things will be attributed with this kind of care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	 If not, then administer the extraction of it using a gesture (carp), that is, you pull back his head by subtle motions with such a shape as this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	 If so attributed to him after the gesture, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	 And if not with a gesture (carp), then administer the extraction of it using a blind touch by subtle strokes in two directions.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	 If not with a blind touch by the gesture (carp), then make a hook from feathers and let its tip enter deeply into the ear opening and pull it out forcefully through your strong grip after loosening it gently with oil, so that no injury occurs to the ear: unless you use a hook.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	 "For one reason I am delighted that you have come.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	 If not, then you must take it from the skullcap or from my hand, that is to say, prepare gluten, with which we cut the vein; and afterwards put this into your forearm just below where you had placed it badly when you were holding on too firmly. Afterwards introduce it into the earhole with ease, after you have shaken off the moisture of the ear.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	 Therefore if I am not delighted with everything that we have taken [i.e., the vein], then quickly prepare a hot chisel or any other suitable instrument to cut it off before removing the hook.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	 And the method of the incision is so that first you make an incision into the head; and remove him from the blood according to his measure of strength he has.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	 Afterwards let the weak one rest between your hands; and gently pull his ear up to its highest point; find the incision in the root of the ear near his cheekbone; and make a slit into the ear's figure, until you have reached the stone: then take him with those instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Afterwards seal up the incision at your time when it is ready; and look after her carefully until she has healed completely.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	 If something falls into the ear from one of many growing growths that are there and inflate; then administer an extraction for him/her.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	 If it does not go out to you with the thin, gentle, subtle manner, then take a very small, fine one according to this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	 And administer the removal of this kind from growths that fall into the ear and do not make it if you think that this one is already moistened through the moisture of the ear because of the swelling; wait until you place it on his/her forehead; then take her out with hooks, or with gentle, subtle, precise movements.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	 If something falls into the ear from water, let the weak one breathe with a nosebleed first; and already closed his/her ear because of some old clot; he/she is lying above her, where there was moisture.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	 Therefore I have learned that this is good
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	 If not then take many stones according to the length of your fingers, thin, light ones and set them ablaze with fire, and introduce one into his ear using a stone from that part [left side] for healing; after this strike him on the foot with another stone placed above it in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	 Therefore, I will not stop doing that until he is entirely healed with a stone and another.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	 I have already learned water so that you take one from a bowl or jug and introduce it into his ear; you set ablaze the extremity of another with fire until all parts are consumed.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	 Then you take another with a tube as prescribed and draw out the one that has been burned into the stone; you will do this many times until he is entirely healed by water.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	 In extracting an animal which is too small for the body, you pour it out as you would from a vessel; and to him who has received such care, treat him similarly by drawing out.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	 But if it is a large body which appears to the senses; then administer the extraction of him with a hand gesture and tweezers; and as for them who have received such care, it will be easier for them than those held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	 In extracting the uremic excrements from the ear when you have cured him as prescribed by distillation and not conferred care; then it is necessary that you scratch his ear with a finger.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	 If therefore something appears there from the excrements, then draw out this one with a gesture or with tweezers.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	 If however nothing appears there, then take a tube as prescribed; the shape of which is narrow below and wide above; and introduce the delicate extremity into the ear according to how much that can be tolerated by the patient. Afterwards suck with it strongly.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	 Do this many times until all excrements have been extracted.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	 If they refuse to obey you at your departure, then they should be tied up with cords as I described it on stone
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	 If they do not comply with what we have said, then administer the distilled substances which are now expert at infecting wounds and use them according to the treatment of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	 And let there be a shower for you with olive oil and medicines on top with this instrument which shape is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	 As I showed you before from the bronze or air below the narrow one where the hole of the ear is, above the broad one.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	 So that it pushes what is within the corded cannula away from the air and down lower.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	 If you are on fire and receive the water; then pour into that which is at its end with a gentle movement of the hand, so as to send the oil or syrup towards it through the cannula; thereafter let there be heated up by fire above, and then come out cooled down from the flame. And what is poured in the ear should now become hot, as if ignited by fire, so that no thing which is distilled may remain cold, for medicines do not tolerate this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	 Of the care of hair loss accidents ears.
Caput VII.	 The seventh head
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	 When some infants come from the parents who have not been perforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	 And it has also happened to some people that loss of hair happens because there was injury at the ear or from birth.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	 And this loss of hair occurs sometimes in the deep hole at the ear which is not due to us; and sometimes it happens from the outside holes barely, and it follows that one.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	 Therefore, those who it has happened at the deep hole of the ear and does not understand the aspect, are very difficult to heal many ways.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	 And for those who it follows us because of an injury at the ear hole, it is necessary to put the ear in the hand with its face down and wash gently; if you see the loss of hair appear, open her with a small brush which shape is this which follows, place your thumb on his extremity where there is some slight latitude, sharp part also exists. And what remains after that should be washed by two hands lightly so as not to burn it.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	 The opening of an artery from skin to ear is done with an incision made delicately and cutting it easily after applying a certain substance that facilitates the process until complete severance of the flesh occurs.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	 If the opening is in the deep ear: Then take a small needle and thread it through delicately, until you have heated it over fire to harden it; then move it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	 If you are performing surgery using this tool and it becomes worn out because of frequent use with hearing impairment, then repair the opening for him carefully to avoid ear pain
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	 After placing the ligature in the ear according to its size opening and piercing it with an awl from Egypt: let this be done for several days until the swelling is settled.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	 Or take the ligature and immerse it in hot water, then squeeze over it vinegar juice, until you mix them together; after that use this mixture to suture him up.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	 If you are removing the ligature already: then remove it immediately and allow it to be mixed with another ligature that has been soaked in olive oil, until the heated ligature is cooled down; after that, take good care of it so that it can heal completely.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	 If you have a burst artery: Then immerse the sponge or cloth in cold water and place it over his head; after that use the remaining cure to stop the blood flow which was cut off by this distillation treatment.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	 On how to heal eyes.
Caput VIII.	 The eighth chapter of the book on head surgery.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	 Those who fall into the eyes and sometimes become wet or dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	 Therefore you should hold them with tweezers; or with a needle and thread the eye and cut it at its root.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	 After that apply vinegar juice to the location.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	 If blood flows from them: then burn them with a small, fine cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	 And after cutting them it is better to burn them.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	 "Many become infected when a part of their roots is severed.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	 If they are burned with fire, the roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	 For healing of eyes
Caput IX.	 Head 9
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	 Many is damaged to the eyes something which is like Ceado with its strength and firmness, because of that it is called Grando; and there is an accumulation of large moisture on the upper eyelid and lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	 Therefore operation on them is necessary, so that you consider when Grando proceeds to it what appears from the eyelid and move to all parts of it; for his is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	 Then find a fissure across the width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	 Then smooth it all around with ease until it is gone.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	 Then suspend it with a hook and remove it.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	 If the separation of his part is not prepared for you except after you penetrate the eyelid with a more powerful incision then that will be harmful to him somewhere.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If there is a large fissure, then bind it firmly with stitching and heal it until it becomes well.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	 And if the fracture is small, you will not suffer evil from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	 It was restored and reborn.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	 If Grando is removed from the inner surface of the ear to its outer surface then the eyelid should be turned inward and suspended with a hook except where you cut it and remove it completely around.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	 If the eyelid is stretched by an incision, it will not be harmful somewhere.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Then close the eye after Grando's removal with salty water and heal the place where it was reborn until the injured one has healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	 For healing of eyes
Caput X.	 Head 10
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	 Axirnath is a swelling that occurs in the upper eyelids of children; and it happens to many boys, causing tears from them morning by morning, so they are not able to look at the sun because their eyes become swollen, hence there were always tears flowing from them, and also the swelling was under the eyebrows which was caused by the inflation. And its great prominence is noticeable on the eye when you touch it with your fingers, and then you feel Axirnath between those two eyelids.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 To perform an operation you should place his head in your hand
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	 After receiving the sheet with incisions and tying it around his neck, proceed to cut off the head according to the quantity contained in the Axirnath from every part of him.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	 Then place him upon it and fasten his head with your hands around the middle of the circle so that Axirnath will be centered within it.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	 After this, find the center of his moisture with a spit-like instrument and make an incision according to depth so that no incision is made for phlebotomy into the deep parts.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	 Or perhaps you should find a complete cut and pass it on to Axirnath with many incisions so that Axirnath proceeds from the incision according to the shape of the white part's edges.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	 Then take the sheet away with your hands and spread it out between yours so that they can be separated; proceed to not include an incision lest you may cut off his eye, tie him back up
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	 If however the shape of Axirnath is not apparent to you at first incision, proceed with the incision only slightly
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	 Then remove it as we described.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	 After removing the sheet with vinegar and water, place them upon a spot, and tie him up tightly.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	 And there are those who have taken the salt and placed it into the incision so that it may dissolve what remains of the moisture from before.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 After this, take care of her until she is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	 If however he falls into a hot place bind him tightly with satiated plasters so that he may be healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	 In the mode of Axirnath to the eye, which means with a relaxation of the eyelid so that it moves like it should not
Caput XI.	 The 11th Head
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	 When there are hairs added to the eyelashes of the eye that grow beyond their course under natural hairs and are equal in number: at this point they harm the eye by striking it with blows like tears and causing irritation of the eyelids and dryness, until this occurs as a cause for destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	 "And for curing eye ailments, there are four modes.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	 With fire cautery.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	 Or with a lancet and acute medicine, as described in the chapter on cauteries.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	 And for curing eye ailments using incisions and stitches (sutures).
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	 Or with tubes, as I say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 It is to be placed on the head of a physician into your hand.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	 Then, with the left hand cover the eye socket.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	 If it is so done, then it's good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	 And if not: pull the thread from beneath the eyelid as it is and make it penetrate through with a needle and tie to the eyebrow ridge; that is, to the hair's head, i.e., to the eyebrow margin where hairs are born; and draw the thread up to the top of the eye as you cover her with your hand.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	 Then find it in the inner part of the eyelid, under hairs added due to spit and tears running down to the tears below; then you will have reached the tear duct lower than the tear ducts themselves.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	 Then draw it out and place beneath the eyelid a small knot made of wax or cloth; then take signs over the eye with charcoal, as it is like the shape of a mourning wreath.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	 However, let its figure be according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid; because it has already been diversified among men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	 These are done by those who make incisions into large portions from the eyelid according to how much the eyelids have been softened.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	 Then find it above two lines that you have drawn and start at the tear duct lower than tears itself down to tears; and there should be a single hole near natural hairs as large as the radius of your hand is wide.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	 Then introduce it into one of two angles of skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	 And then you are done.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	 Finally bind the lips closed with a double fold of thread and needle thin linen; and remove blood, so that you do not exceed what is left on both sides by the threads above two eyebrows, if it can be done: and if not, then do not cure.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	 "If you remove sutures after three days at the latest, or four.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	 "And if there is a wound without sutures, then take care of it with oil and vinegar so that it may be dried up and tightened.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	 "The eyelid swells upon the swelling around the wound, but recovery is better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	 "This manner of treatment was used by ancient physicians.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	 "However, there is a lot of effort on the sick person and good work does not create fear.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	 "And another way of treatment is in Ataxmir as well; and it is so that there are signs above the eyelid shaped like a leaf cut out, just like we know.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	 "After the eyelid swells apart from three strands or together with four, according to its shape which follows then you cut off what is left over using small cuts in the same way as before.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	 "If you cannot hold onto one thread and it does not match well then take the other thread in your hand and put it into the middle of the shape; and put another thread on its way towards tears more, and one thread on its way to tears less: and gather the threads between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	 "After you have gathered both hands equally then take a thread above the one that is marked out as before in the same way.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 "Then gather two lips together with sutures and care for it until it gets better.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	 "If you accidentally cut the eyelid when making your incision or tearing it then apply oil and vinegar to it.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	 "And sometimes eyelids also occur where hair grows out of them.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	 "Therefore, it is advised to use sutures as we mentioned before the incision; but stitching more than one is artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	 "About curing of Ataxmir with animals.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	 "And it is so that you apply oil and vinegar to the eyelid, and cut off any cuts that have come out in the same way as before.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	 In the art of making two hooks or two thin rods, their length should be according to the length of the eyelid and their width shall be less than that of a very small sponge; you have already made an incision at both ends where you hold them together
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	 After attaching both ends to the eyelid using a thin rod in excess of that which is available from the eyeball's eyelid, and after binding them with strong thread on both sides, you should release it at intervals over several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	 The tightened skin will die (die) and become emaciated, and will decompose unless it is released itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	 If this occurs late then make an incision with hooks.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	 After which you must take care of it so that it may heal.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	 Once they are secured together the eyelid will become firm; and hairs will not be pulled out.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	 And this is the shape of two hooks that you should make according to this figure, quantity being in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	 With the pulling out of hairs from the eye with sharpness
Caput XII.	 The end
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	 Operation is performed on this as you take a thin thread and introduce it into the eye from its edge with great care.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	 After attaching both ends to him, then tie each end of the thin cord firmly and let one thread be as long as a finger.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	 After joining them together with another thin thread below him for a short time, then tie off the ends of his fingers tightly
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	 After you have placed your head inside your hand and it is close to the sun, for this operation is thin or small in size.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	 After you have introduced the thread at the root of the eyelid and made it penetrate further into the eyelid with force, until you remove it from above a natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	 After removing the thread up to where you have introduced it, then introduce another thread at this point or somewhere above that, either one or two or three threads, not more than these.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	 Then take your finger with him, until he gets away from under his hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	 If his hair is pulled back after taking your finger, and he does not get away from under it: take that same finger to the lower eyelid, using a thread you prepared earlier, until he gets away from under his hair; then pull him towards the upper eyelid with the other hand, so that both eyes are covered. When this has been done, remove the eye patch as described above, and in three days or more it will grow back over its place on his forehead, restoring him to normal health.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	 If the hair is very short, then attach it to his longer hairs with those of nature and tie him down as mentioned above; or remove him immediately if you want to shorten them quickly, until they reach their full length, after which remove him again.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	 Of the causes that may occur in the eyelid above.
Caput XIII.	 The Thirteenth Head
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	 When this happens to an eye, it is called Leporinia.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 This eye patch can be either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	 Accidental causes include injuries caused by blows to the face, cutting off his eyelids with scissors, or tearing them in wrestling matches or similar situations.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	 The mode of operation is as follows: to find a thread between the eyelids and sew it up so that his eyes are closed, until he recovers from this injury.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	 Do not neglect the need for treatment of any injury that causes pain or constriction when he is being operated on; since if you do this, his eye patch will be worse than before, use such remedies to soften them as a poultice made from fennel leaves soaked in water, rubbed with ointment of unguentum dyaquilon, which has been made by mixing it with olive oil. And bind him up tightly and carefully, so that the treatment is complete, or you will be unable to remove his eye patch even if he recovers from the injury.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	 Your treasure trove of treatments is as follows: you must apply your ingenuity and not let him get sewn up again in the way it was at first; but rather use a poultice made from fennel leaves soaked in water, rubbed with unguentum dyaquilon ointment that has been made by mixing olive oil.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	 "This operation is not mentioned in our previous discussion, but rather a correction by Albucasis to prevent the form from becoming distorted according to what was originally intended.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	 "The treatment of the lower eyelid by Albucasis is either a fold or contraction upwards towards the right and left sides.
Caput XIIII.	 The number 12, in Roman numerals.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	 "The treatment of the lower eyelid by Albucasis is called the 'treatment of Albucasis.'
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	 "It's natural and accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	 "Accidental injuries can occur through a wound or tear, or by other means similar to these.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	 "The path of this operation is to grasp the doubled thread and pull it through to the skin, then cut it so that it penetrates into both sides of the nose up to both sides of the tear.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	 "Then stretch out the meat upwards with a knife on one side and cut it, then use your other hand as well.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	 "If this operation causes the eyelid to conform to what is expected, it is beneficial.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	 "If the eyelid was not corrected properly then grasp a rod and put it in a tear, hold the eye lid so that you make two tears on the inner corner of the eyelid, and find both tears at the ends from which angles the incision occurs. Until they meet and become one figure: until when they are made into these figures is the Greek letter 'L'. It means 'good luck'.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	 "Then stretch out that meat from its inferior thickness downwards towards the eye.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	 "Then bring together the separate parts: hold it with a thread of linen.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	 "And then perform the treatment as mentioned before in our discussion about mollifying medicines and applying ointments until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	 "And if Albucasis caused a tear or cut it then you should apply a patch until the flat tear is found below the eyebrow hair, as well as according to what came before.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	 Then separate between two lips with a hook, as we have stated before
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	 And at the end of a patient's care, when it is superior or inferior to his operation, it should be performed according to what has been prepared from the form of Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	 The shape of each part is different: and a prudent artificer prepares the body with whatever way it can be done, until he has directed the figure to its natural form or direction towards it, or even to that which is impaired; and the same infirmity, according to what was agreed upon by his operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	 The detachment of the eyelids from the conjunctiva or the cornea.
Caput XV.	 Chapter Fifteen.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	 When this occurs in many men, the fixation of the upper eyelid with the whites of the eyes should be done so that it may not be hindered by its own natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	 Therefore you must insert the extremities of your fingers under the eyelid and hold it up: or extend it with a hook; then cut through to its detachment with a small sharp tool, so that it is not hindered by the sharpness of the incision, rather being obtuse than blunt: in order not to disturb the patient during operation, and remove it gently, and anoint the eye with your own fluid; and make an incision as you release it from its attachment gradually, until when returned to its natural form, and become whole again.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	 Then drop into the eye some salty water, or distill it from its own juice if you are able to do so with water alone.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	 Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a hook liner; and place over the eye a moistened cloth lined with white linen; and after three days use it along with solids, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	 Chapter Sixteen.
Caput XVI.	 Of the incision of the eyelids and prominence of the cheeks in weeping.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	 It is done according to two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	 "It is a gentle thing and it is similar in strength to a sinew.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	 "It is not a gentle thing and it resembles frozen white frost; when touched by iron or grasped with an awl, it splits apart and does not stick to the awl.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	 "The two do not begin to grow together unless they are wetted with more tears, until it yields gradually and stops the flow of light, and moves the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 "The method of using this substance is as follows: you place a weakened head into your own hand, or put it between your fingers.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	 "Then you open the eyes by touching them with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	 "Next, press it gently between two fingers and stretch it out above.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	 "Then take it in your hand and hold its two ends with a needle from horsehair or similar materials; make the thread strong enough to double the length of the eye, but not too thick that you cannot stretch out all the way to the pupil: then insert into the eye with an awl, bind the two ends together with string, extend it fully above and open up completely.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	 "Finally, cut off the remaining part at the root of tears with a delicate and slender instrument; or with tweezers made for this purpose. Release the natural tear course as it will not be impeded by the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	 "And sometimes you stretch out the eye using only a needle or string, just like we said earlier.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	 "Finally, scrape away with a gentle and slender instrument as described in this section.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	 "Do not touch the delicate eyelid skin or cause it to tear apart; otherwise it will be ruined and cover the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 "After making an incision but before inserting anything into the eye, wash it gently with a saline solution or clean it thoroughly using another instrument and remove it to be used later.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	 "And then apply whatever you need until it is healed completely.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	 If the ulcer is not healed and cannot be introduced into it with a probe, nor does it pierce through to the other side of the ulcer from its base; then cure this kind of ulcer by means of ointments containing unguents (drugs). It will heal just like an incision in the flesh.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	 If you wish to enter this ulcer and make an incision with a probe, then open the eye of the patient, take gentle and subtle spit, soft, weak due to old age, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	 And approach it from above with subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	 If you see that it becomes rare and is crushed by reason, and it imprints upon it a reason, then distill from your eye at the time of its occurrence out to another eye in this way: either due to factitious reasons or due to weak rubes, or sale truffles; and cleanse the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 Then repeat this same treatment until you remove completely from him
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	 Unless it is contrary to the custom of your eye being warm; then let loose this same ulcer and cure the wound until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat this treatment with reason, until you heal him completely.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	 However, if the treatment with tears of the eyelids is contrary to custom and causes great pain when it touches the eye; then hold back this same ulcer by its base using a probe, and make an incision into that part of him; but do not finally cut out until you have cured the tear course.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	 Then hold back gently using a very weak spit or due to a factitious reason, until you heal him completely.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	 From the incision of the glans penis and the flesh of the eye.
Caput XVII.	 The seventeenth chapter.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	 A person's flesh is formed and placed in the eye when it occurs once or twice at certain times; until it closes its pupil with a veil of flesh, or extends itself towards the pupil, or stretches to the eyelid, sometimes turning over the eyelid towards the outside: and it assimilates the baluster roses.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the treatment for this is also done by placing a weak headpiece on your brow.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	 "Then open his eyes and tie down his head with a strip around it so that the whole meat hangs down beneath him, then hold on to this with one tool or by hand.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	 "Then cut off the head first until only his neck is left with a cutting tool.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	 "Then place it on his face so that the incision will not be seen during surgery; and if you are using a curved cutting tool or scissors then cut off just above the elbow to make sure everything is done neatly.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	 "When your incision is complete and all the arm has been removed then remove his eye with a soft cloth or towel; also apply some medicine to cool it down, if you wish.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	 "If anything remains from the arm then apply warm blood to you and control your heat; then remove his eye and take care of it as you would any other.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	 "Then repeat this for him after he has been operated on until he is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	 "And similar things should be done with the added flesh that was cut from his eye by cutting it off like so.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	 "However it is necessary to treat any weak eye from the natural or accidental way with a cutting tool; and do not let your hand interfere in another operation until that one has been completed so that you may tolerate that member undergoing the operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	 "Of the Sebel removal from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	 "Chapter Eighteen: The Head.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	 "A Sebel is a cloth used to cover the eye and it prevents your own surgery from being seen; it also weakens or makes weaker the eye as time passes.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	 "Therefore it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye with which a Sebel is used is strong and not has any weakness there except for the Sebel; then tie down that Sebel.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	 "And it is also necessary to consider if his head is weak so that he puts his own head into your hand.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	 "After you have made the incision, either with one or two curved hooks according to your judgment; and let each hook be smooth on both sides so that they can grasp.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	 "Then close the incisions with fine hooks in such a way that they will not cause injury; and after you have done so, remove any blood at once before it can be removed through the eye, or they will tear.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	 "Your work should take place during daylight; and you must have strength for your work so that you do not cut unless necessary.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	 "When you have completed it, then put a small knife into the eye or into the ear; so that your sharpness may cut off what remains from the flesh.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	 "If you are unable to close that during the same hour; then put your eye-needle into his eye so that he may feel pain and release him from there.
Et haec est forma forficis.	 "This is how you make an incision.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	 "From the excess of thirst to the nose.
Caput XIX.	 "The ninth head.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	 "When the physician reaches Arissa's fist, he should either treat it with cautery or burn it with a strong medicine according to his story.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	 "If it is not healed then there must be a cause that the mucus which is there and pus can come out through his mouth.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	 "When this is done, you will see that he has got rid of the corruption or blackness; then put it with a tool whose shape is like this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	 "The tenth head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	 "Let the head be cut off with an iron; and make it round like Aziris so that it is made smooth by a needle of lime or by a small iron needle, and put it on a corrupted bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	 Therefore take hold of it between your fingers and you shall make its proper use; until you learn that this corruption has already occurred. And when you have learned, do
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	 Then restore the place with the help of medicinal substances applied to it.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	 If the place is restored and flesh appears therein then the course of sin (sin) disappears along with it; after forty days have passed without any recovery or further progress being made, that point indicates healing has occurred.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	 And if not, then there is no natural outlet for it except to reduce the fist through the nostrils, following this path.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	 And it is so that you break away from the bone with a second stroke of iron or with an acute medicine; and when the mouth has been found then take hold of its back following this path, make it solid, triangular: and its wood should be reduced to a pyramid shape until reaching the extremity.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	 Then place this upon his mouth; let it hang down in front of his eyes, and extend your hand from the mouth only slightly.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	 Therefore take hold of the hand with the stick; until it penetrates into his mouth and he feels this cold thing on his tongue; by doing so you will remove the poison from him as you hold your hand over his mouth.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	 Therefore restore the place with the help of medicinal substances applied to it, just as I have shown you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	 And when flesh appears and the place is hardened; then the material that was poured upon the outside comes back to the nose: it therefore sticks to the sick one above all others.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	 Of the reduction of prominence (or prominence) of the eyes.
Caput XX.	 Head Twenty
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	 When the eye comes out with its entire part and there is no falling of the eyelids or diminution; then it is necessary to take only one sick person; afterwards apply leeches to him; after this place tubes near his ear without any scarring but by suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	 Then place upon the eyes ointment which is made from acacia and aloe and oil of myrrh and sarcolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	 "Then grasp an eyelid above the eye with a multitude of eyelashes.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	 The method of eyelashes is as follows: grasp the upper eyelid with many lashes and double it on top; then place one over another in multiples according to quantity - above all four, then above three etc., until you reach the eye itself. Then grasp them with a hard cloth firmly
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	 And repeat this motion with suction without making incisions.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	 Then release the eyelid and remove the tight band of skin during the day and at night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	 If the tightening band is loosened in future repetitions, then it should be tightened once again; after that release it during the day and at night as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	 If you want to correct the eyelid's position once more while using the band and if not then repeat the tightening band, eyelashes, and release pressure until the eye is corrected.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	 From making incisions of the eyelid's bandage
Caput XXI.	 The 21st chapter.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	 When the eyelid's bandage breaks, it is then placed out and proceeds to wrap around like a grain of salt, and adheres to the shape of a man due to that; you should make an incision there, as follows: and it is, so as to insert a finger into the root of the eyelid from below to above.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	 Then insert another finger with its double strand on the opposite side of the tear duct and make it penetrate; then release the first one according to your own arrangement.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	 Then cut through the two strands of the eyelid and bind them tightly around the eye's circumference; then tighten it very much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	 Then remove it and put a loop of thread on the eye with an oar; then release him until the thread is with the eyelid.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then care for the eye by holding it as needed to correct its position until the injury has healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	 And when the eyelid is tightened with a circle of cloth from all sides, until the eye's prominence increases greatly.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	 "Then, with a fine spatula, remove any residue of the eye and pour in clear water. The eye will descend immediately; after that, gently pull it out and quickly apply it.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	 From the remedy of Alcomnate
Caput XXII.	 In the treatment of an attack on the head with a severity of twenty two.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	 This remedy is called Alcomnateor, and unless it is cured, which gathers in the eye just like a clear water descending, it will not be itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	 And the method to do this is as follows: either gently set down or support someone with an infirmity over a raised bed that has been prepared for them; otherwise, you should direct them in some way.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	 Then take his head into your hands on the two sides; and gently move it down so that you can remove him from the lower part of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	 Then he becomes quiet and does not descend; and his light disappears; the patient is like him again; if it did not descend lower, you know that it was water
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	 If however, when I said the descent of the eye with him what we have mentioned, then gently set down the patient between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	 Then take with a fine spatula and find it above the surface of the corium layer at the junction between the conjunctiva and the cornea, until it descends immediately.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 And when it descends then you should immediately pour into the eye a warm water which was prepared as I mentioned earlier; or else use the other water and its solution of honey. Then after that is cured until he is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	 From the treatment with water that descends into the eye or a cataract.
Caput XXIII.	 In the treatment of an attack on the head with a severity of thirty three.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	 We have mentioned earlier that kind of water and it is used for piercing the membrane with a needle and an expander; then you take that one according to health
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then you should gently set him down or support the patient between your hands square and opposite to the light of the sun; and apply the eye of his good health and pull it out quickly; then touch with your right hand the eyelid of the eye in which water is, if there is a left one; or else use your left hand for the other one.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 With your right hand take the instrument if it is on the right side; or with your left hand, if it is on the left side.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	 With the right hand take the instrument and apply it to the nose as far as possible by extending the arm; afterwards pull it gently with strength using both hands until it reaches the eye. And when you feel that the instrument has penetrated into the tear duct, you will notice that the object is now within the eyeball.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	 It is necessary to measure how far the instrument goes along the nose and up until it reaches the end of the nasal septum; and this is called the "corona" or "rim" of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	 But you should also do this: insert it into the pupil of the eye because of the clarity of the cornea's membrane.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	 Afterwards, apply the instrument until it reaches where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	 After that, remove it from one side to start on the other.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	 If water descends immediately, then at that moment you will see it above what was the opening of his eye; and place it into his eye as quickly as possible.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	 Then close your eyelids gently.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	 If water descends after that, then put it aside from the other side as well.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	 When this happens and does not go up; then remove the instrument gently with speed using both hands.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	 Afterwards dissolve it into something from a clear droplet of oil, after removing it from eye.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	 After that put aside the whole eyelid or insert a piece of oiled wool onto it; and after doing this place an eye bandage on it; and then tie with it the healthy eye as tightly as possible.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	 But for us of our times we put upon him a mixture of charcoal and alum.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	 If the instrument does not take you into the tear duct due to its hardness since people have found it that way and it is hard in use; then you should remove it gently as quickly as possible, called "Alberid" because of this shape.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	 With this you will join her together only once and not again after that, excepting your own hand to the purpose of needling; unless it is done skillfully at the place where she is set down
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	 Then introduce the needle in accordance with what we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	 And from the completion of your work you should retire to a sick-bed, where he lies in the dark; and be prohibited from all motion by his hands, except that which serves for food, even as nature dictates it: and let not his head move on its right side, nor on his left hand.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	 And you should keep the bandage according to your disposition until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	 Then take him into that dark house and see what his condition is; and do for him whatever is to be done.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	 And you should remove the bandage according to your disposition until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	 It is not permitted to do this at the time of healing or immediately after the operation; it should be done by another, because water ascends quickly through a wound which has been opened.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	 If a cold finger has been lost, then let it be introduced before the seventh day; and rectify that which was set with it until it is satiated: and after this take away its use, putting on above his mouth where he feeds his own flesh beneath him for several days in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	 Then return to your home gradually, and arrange yourself in the beds you have made.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	 And know that a pupil is not excused from his duty at intervals of time; then he may do for the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	 And indeed we have heard from certain people who are of Albucasis that what was done in the passage from Albucasis was made by puncturing through the hand to let water flow out.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	 Indeed I did not find anyone among our own who had done this; nor could I find it in any of the ancient books that we have; and there is a possibility for it to be new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	 These are shapes of organs from the abdomen, so as not to cause harm when they are ignored.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	 They should be placed in their proper position; and the extremities of them should have the same degree of sharpness as that which is required for the triangle (i.e., scalpel).
Formae magda.	 Shapes from the abdomen
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	 From birth, care should be taken to avoid injury by nose into body.
Caput XXIIII.	 Head (twenty-four).
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	 When newborn animals are introduced into the nose of a person who has scorpion stings on their feet; from this there arises something that is akin to poison in many feet and also arises in it cancerous matter, matter of flesh (scarlet), fur (of skin) of colors: and from this arises what is lenis body matter not of color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	 In such things that from those bodies there arises what is lenis not deceitful and also not cancerous should be said to stop being used (as remedies) against the sick person in your hands opposing only one hand alone: you must hold his nose, and push back a finger into their bodies; then pull them out towards the outside, and strike that which you comprehended from those with the fine pointed tool on both sides until now you know that the body is already completely wiped out.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	 If anything remained of what whose removal was impossible; then you will take that with one tool from the fine tools in an easy way until it no longer remains out of him something.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	 If the blood to you becomes dominated or if it is injured by a hot probe; then bind him with that which should be used: or if he is possessed of venomous apostems, then cauterize his (binding) and until the bleeding stops, and all the flesh will be removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	 After the incision there should be poured into the nose of the patient vinegar or water or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	 If he opens his nose and proceeds from him until that which is wet reaches up to the palate: then you will know because he is already healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	 If however the wetness does not penetrate as it should: then you will know that there is cancerous matter which has arisen from within his nose up to the upper openings of the nostrils but did not come out with the incision of a tool.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	 Therefore it is necessary to insert a string of some length into the vein that has many knots in it and then tie all these knots with one another: either by using your fingers or fewer; if you are unskilled, use an instrument like scissors so as to cut off one end of the thread towards its nose (if possible) or along whatever direction is convenient for him after he has finished sewing such a thing. And then put back on his throat that which he has removed from it.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	 Many children of Attus do this same trick at school; and for them it is very easy to learn how to do it
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	 Then tie one end of the thread towards its nose and leave another still inside his nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	 And then tighten the knot around the finger as there are knots in the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	 When you have finished sewing, until you know that the fingers of meat and the knots of the thread are already tied together
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	 Then remove the thread from its nose and put back on it what you drank off of the finger with the Egyptian ointment after the blood has been washed away: do this for three days or more until the ointment completely dissolves whatever remains from the meat.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 And finally tie a knot around it with lead after some time has passed: do this for as many days as needed until healing occurs.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	 If the ointment you used for sewing is exhausted, use that one instead.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	 To clean the head with oil and other medicines from it, do this by using an egg or air instead; so that what is similar to the flame of fire will be burned off in a way similar to blowing out a candle: and let whatever remains of him burn off in the same manner.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	 And if you tie a closed knot like that
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	 To clean the head with oil and other medicines from it, you use a tool for that purpose: keep its handle while heating it up until you have removed all of it through steam or by any other method.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	 This is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	 Of the nose's care
Caput XXV.	 Head, 25th.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	 It is born and adorned with great care as soon as the nose reaches its utmost extent; it grows larger each day until a suitable size is reached for use of clothing or other adornments on it.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	 And this should be so that the appearance and shape of it at its beginning might resemble what is now seen; and all its parts should be reduced to him
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	 Then they must apply a remedy in the place where this happens; either a bandage or an ointment applied to it.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	 If this should be delayed by a delay in its opening; then it must be considered if it is made of stone or horn or fleshly color and furrowed with bristles, so that the time for cutting off [the cancerous] growth will come, when the matter is dealt with: because the tumor has spread.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	 Indeed many heard who had cut off this tumor and met a great evil from it which he had on him
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	 And if the tumor is gently touched and does not have bristles on it, you will know that cutting into its whole extent was possible; then apply a remedy to it quickly, without fear or hesitation: until health comes back
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	 Of the nose's care and ears and mouth's care.
Caput XXVI.	 Head, 26th.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 Because when the solution of continuity has been lost on one side of those cartilages; only a few can perform it unless some people do.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And it should be so when anything happens from that; you will see if he is wounded by his own blood and then tie up the wound with sutures; after that, take care of him until he is healed.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	 And if the solution of continuity has already been separated and one healthy part is made; then it must be done that you remove all parts from his sight in front of him until he bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 After tying up the two lips with sutures and stringing them out; pour oil of dragons over him so as to stop his bleeding, and also sprinkle crushed oylabum on it; put a bandage upon him with a hole made in front like this one [indicates]; bind the other part closed by means of an implement placed above. And release after three days or more, unless he is bound with two bandages.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	 "Remove (remove) and exchange medicine; after removing it they will fall apart by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 "And remove the bandage
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	 "The surgical technique is to combine the continuous flow of solution or by means of an abacus and stitching as we do with the stitches inside us; either combining a bandage with thread so that I taught you how.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	 "To remove the knots
Caput XXVII.	 "Chapter 27".
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	 "To many people the hard knots (remarks) are inside their intestines, and some of them smaller and larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	 "Therefore, it is necessary to make a loop in the threads, so that you remove (cut) all the knots of him with a knife and cut off (remove) him from every part.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 "After removing the knot tie it tightly so that the blood stops.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	 "It is tied with vinegar and cured when it was with him where there is a stiffness until they stop the ulcers.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	 "Of the incision of the beginning of the tongue above the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	 "Chapter 28
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	 "The additional part of the tongue that is added above the gum.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	 "Therefore it is necessary to remove it with a knife, either you hold her tightly or tie with your fingers and cut off from the root of his own.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	 "After removing the knot ties tight so that the ulcers stop.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	 "If she got it after treatment of the ulcer, as many times he did, then you cut him again and burn her; but she herself does not come out from the burning.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	 "Of the wisdom with a knife (tooth) to
Caput XXIX.	 "Chapter 29
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	 "When the teeth above the gums from the interior and exterior parts come together with the tongue's surface, and when they are cut up to the side of the tongue, stumps, and when they give out and disappear, and virides [survivors], until it is gone corruption from him to the gum, and the teeth become empty.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	 Let it happen that you may hold a sick person between your hands and put his head in yours and gently touch both the eye-lids and tongue; where if you find any resemblance to those of an arena fighter, do not neglect but remove them with great care: until nothing remains from these except some part only. If you wish, however, you may also strike a blow at him with a sharp instrument in order to put him out of his misery.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	 If indeed there is reason at the beginning of these things and goodness prevails over them, then all will be well; but if not, let another day come to examine and try again tomorrow, the second time; and on a third day until you have finished your studies in him.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	 And you know that the different shapes of instruments used in your surgery are important; namely, one shape for cutting through the skin from below is different to one for cutting between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	 The shapes of instruments used by you will be prepared beforehand as far as I know.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	 On extracting pain from the teeth
Caput XXX.	 Head (omitted).
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	 Let it happen that you may cure the pain of his tooth with all your ingenuity and try to eradicate this from him
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	 For it is not the case that a man may be cured when he has been eradicated; for its substance is very high and until there is no excuse to eradicate him from then you must try again as soon as he becomes sick in order to cure him, so that it can be certified by you of the suffering one.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	 Many indeed suffer from pain and believe that cutting through it will eradicate them; but afterwards the pain does not go away until they are eradicated by a sore person.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	 We now understand this from the work of phlebotomists.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	 When it is certified by you of the suffering one that they may be cured from all the pain; afterwards, let them strike at their tooth with a spit-cleaner and gently touch him to remove it completely, until all of his teeth are gone: afterwards move him out using your fingers or with fine forceps.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	 "Then take hold of a good forceps in the hand and place them on your lap for cutting; when you have already performed this operation well and with care, do not let it move or drop from your hand until you carefully draw out the tooth using it according to its position.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	 "If you do not succeed, then take one of their instruments and gently introduce it beneath him from every part with ease; after that, compare its movement as you did before.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	 "If the tooth is perforated or has been burned off; then take care to introduce a piece of cloth into it and tightly wrap it around with the end of your delicate fingers so that it does not break due to the pressure you apply while using forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	 "And take care to remove all traces of blood from around the tooth with great care and cleanliness.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	 "And guard your strength so that you do not break it and the part remains whole; after that, let it fall off from that evil trickery which is more painful for him than before.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	 "And remember not to do what ignorant phlebotomists do at the time of their own excitement and audacity over its destruction; except for what you have already mentioned.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	 "Many people make big mistakes when trying to extract teeth from men because they are more fragile and can break; the roots remain all of them, or some of those, or that they extract it with the jaws of the mouth in such a way as we have tested before.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	 "Then bind him up after its destruction using wine, vinegar, or salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	 "If the flow of blood from there is abundant and often happens; then take something out of it immediately and carefully with that place; but if not, burn him using a cautery or do not let him go until you take something else.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	 "Forceps of small size are used first; the ends long and delicate, the middle ones short and strong so that they do not break when force is applied over the tooth like heavy tools; these are like thick sticks until you draw them tightly with care without damaging yourself or breaking them; the thin ones have teeth at their end which sometimes bite into something and clamp tight by force.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	 When extremities are compressed like a beak of a cuckoo and are strong against constriction
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	 The removal of teeth and the extraction of the mandibular bones that have fractured
Caput XXXI.	 Section 31
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	 When a tooth is broken and needs to be removed during the removal of teeth, it should be placed on top with butter for one or two days until the place becomes comfortable; then insert into its mouth, or use pliers: whose extremities become beak-like.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	 This is a form for pliers.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	 Their extremities are made as thin as the blades of grass, or like a sickle blade.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	 If you cannot remove it with those pliers, then take another pair of pliers and place the whole piece on top and insert a tool called Palanca's bow, whose form is this one.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	 The thin extremities are stronger than those that have been soaked in oil; so they will not break when used properly.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	 If the root is cut through that one, it is good; and if not, you need to use another pair of pliers whose forms are like this one.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	 The first has a triangular extremity with some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	 The thin triangular extremity.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	 You need to use this tool with two arms whose form is like this one.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	 And with the other instruments and tools that came before them in extracting teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	 The tool is the large one with a triangular extremity twisted and having some thickness as not to break; it should be used when soaked (i.e., not fresh).
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	 You know that there are many tools for extracting teeth; and similarly the other tools are not counted, so a skilled craftsman has found an appropriate tool by himself with his own art, according to what operation he is performing and the skills of these tools.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	 "For those instruments which were not mentioned before by earlier writers because of their diversity.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	 "If the mouth is broken by a bone from the jaw or another bone of the face, it becomes necessary to search for that which was suitable with his instruments and fingers as I described in the removal of the root, and to hold him with a grip, such as this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	 "It should be gently stretched or held with it the mouth so that no dripping or loss of saliva occurs and a place is restored when appropriate, together with suitable medicines.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 "However if decay has set in the bone, then cure it by its own means and take care of it until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	 "Of the extraction of the teeth superior to others.
Caput XXXII.	 "Chapter thirty-two.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	 "When the teeth superior are not extracted as prescribed by their own nature a wound occurs due to that form and especially when it happens among women or children.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 "Therefore take care, considering this.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 "For if the tooth is born after another one and cannot be located or if it is possible to extract him without breaking any other teeth then remove it immediately and when it has been attached with a tooth: at that point strike it off with this instrument whose form is like this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	 "It is very similar to the face but happens by an iron wound and severe extremity of the mouth.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	 "And you must make an incision to extract him during many days, due to the hardness of teeth and so that no other person or tooth is damaged.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	 "However if it has been exposed in its own cutting out groove then cut him off with the cutter whose form is like this one.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	 "The whole of him is extracted by the fingers and the small points of his hand are exposed so that a point or a cutter can be used to cut out the tooth during many days as desired but not to damage it, until finally he is relaxed in order to extract him with some cutters.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	 When the part is cut off from what it was dense with, and its language fails; then let this be done, that he may become smooth again (the wound), until it becomes fresh and equal in smoothness to before: and it shall be pliant once more, but not allow itself to be taken by any of his own parts.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	 About the treatment of teeth with a child's arrow
Caput XXXIII.	 The 33rd part.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	 When the teeth are struck before by concussion and motion from percussion; or if it is struck at all: they cannot be made to fall down with that which has caused them not to yield to what has caused them not to fall; [but] as a result of this treatment, in those there is an entrance so that strings can be applied with the child's arrow.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	 And let the arrow be a means for subtlety and coarseness according to its quantity which may pierce between the teeth
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	 The shape of the treatment is such that you take in the arrow, and insert two of his between the two healthy teeth; then apply with both extremities of the cord among the teeth separately if one or more are inserted until you bind up with cloth as far as another part of the tooth.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	 Then again apply the treatment up to the part that you struck in; and with subtlety and wisdom bind it until it is not removed from before; and let your binding be so as when you bind the cord among the roots of the teeth such that it does not yield.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	 Then drive back the extremities of the cord with hooks; and join them one by one [in pairs]; and intertwine those among the healthy tooth and the moving tooth such that no language is yielded; then let it be loosened so tightly until it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	 If he has been successful or was struck through with another cord, bind him as tightly as you can for the same length of time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	 And this is the form of teeth and the figure of two healthy teeth and two moving teeth as you see it.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	 "And sometimes it happens that a single wire may hold one thing or two things after its break; it retains them as firmly as we grasp our tools and they remain.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	 "And sometimes it happens that something is supported from the broken ends of a cord; as securely as if our teeth were holding onto it and it's placed in its proper place, where it supports the weight and is tightened, just like we described.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	 "Of a ligament that breaks under the tongue and prevents [its] removal.
Caput XXXIIII.	 "Chapter 40.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	 "And sometimes the ligament that breaks under the tongue is either natural as part of human growth or accidental when it has already been consolidated.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	 "The operation is done to the broken ligament so that you grasp it with your fingers as if it were in your hand and pull out its tongue; then cut this slippery ligament by cutting through it at right angles until the tongue can be held by its tension.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	 "If the broken ligament was caused by a severe injury and swelling, then it is from the consolidation of wounds; after that you should first make an incision into this knot and cut through it until you find it.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 "And so be it if there is a deep wound; then make an incision into that artery and stop the flow of blood.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	 "Then you should tie off the incision with heated or cold water or vinegar [to clean it].
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	 "After that you put under the tongue a slippery substance from linen which holds fast day and night; so that it does not become consolidated again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	 "If there is a flow of blood after that, then put above the wound a poultice made from wool.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 "If there is blood coming from the wound then you should apply a poultice made of a heated iron that fits to it; then after that you should care for him with the remaining treatment until he heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	 "Chapter on the removal of the Ranula [wart] under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	 Fifty-fifth head
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	 When the blow struck beneath a seal (of speech), transforming it into the voice of a frog; preventing its normal language by his own operation; and may this be splendidly enhanced until both are filled up.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	 And the operation is done to make you hear its voice when it stands before the sun; and consider (the frog).
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	 If therefore you see him suddenly dark or bright or of any color other than that which was affected by the illness; then do not touch it because he is a malignant tumor.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	 And if the seal suddenly becomes white and moist; then with a sharp instrument strike through it from all sides; and release (it) from every part.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	 If you see blood on the time of your operation; then place a bandage over it until the bleeding stops; and thereafter return to your own treatment to remove it with its appropriate complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 And afterwards you shall apply vinegar and salt; and complete the remaining care in that fashion until he is cured.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	 Of the two Amigdala of the sealers
Caput XXXVI.	 Sixty-fifth head
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	 When blows strike between the Adam's apple and the epiglottis which resemble each other; and both are called the Amigdalae; when you cure them as we have said to do with division but they don not heal (this); then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	 If therefore you see him suddenly dark or bright or of few senses; then do not touch it with a sharp instrument.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	 And if you see him suddenly dark or bright and the root of his is thick; then do not touch it even with a sharp instrument fearing the outflow of blood; and release (it) until maturity comes.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	 Then you may either perforate him yourself or leave him to be ripped apart by nature.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	 And if he is suddenly white and round and the root of his is soft; then it will need to be cut into two.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 The operation is done so that you consider before your own treatment if its seal has been quietly completed; or may some diminution occur to it; then let the head of him be in your hand; and hear his voice, and he shall receive from yours (servants) with open hands, and will cause the lower part of its language by a tool which is this shape.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	 "Let it be as subtle as a bee.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	 "Since the premise is with it [the subject], and the apostrophe is given to you; there falls upon him your follower, he climbs on top of him [your subject]; then take one end, and bind it in a knot, and remove it from outside as much as you can, except for what you draw out through the tunic.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	 "Then cut her [the subject] with an instrument whose form follows after this one.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	 "She is drawn through the mouth; however her extremities should be bound tight so that the opening of [the instrument] from which she comes out may be sharp on one side.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	 "If this instrument is not present then cut it with a blunt object whose form follows after this one.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	 "Let the cutting be sharp on only one side, not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	 "After you have cut through [the subject] with a single stroke, then cut the second in accordance with this same pattern of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	 "Then after cutting, apply ice to your throat if you are feeling cold; or vinegar and water can be applied as well.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 "If you have suffered a flow of blood into the throat, gargle with water in which the granulator's teeth are burnt; or ivy and similar [substances] from strychnine and similar poisons until the bleeding ceases.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	 "And when other pustules are born into the throat apart from the two [amigdalas], beyond these as well.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	 "Therefore cut them according to what I said about cutting through the two amigdalas equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	 "And I myself had treated a woman from an abscess that was born between her throat and she pulled it out to be cut; very few senses remained in her and she already closed the throat; then she breathed with me as tightly held, and no longer allowed food or drink water; and death would come upon her if it lasted for one day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	 "The arrow ascended, having hit two marks; then it passed over the upper part of the nose.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	 Therefore I bound them fast, and fastened one by one
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	 Then I drew it out, and from that a great part was taken away
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	 Therefore I let her fall at the place where I understood that an opening of the nose had been made.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	 Then I did to him who went out from the other nostril what had passed through the first one.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	 Therefore I opened his mouth and pressed the tongue of him; thereafter fixed one by one on it the arrow; then I drew off a part from him, and not did run out except a little blood: thus was done to her what had been done to the man; immediately she began to drink water, after having taken in food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	 Therefore I did not cease to strike the arrow for a long time; and the arrow was at that place which I struck
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	 Therefore I made an incision between his throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	 It was therefore added; thereafter I walked on the side, and did not know what God had done with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	 From making an incision of the arrow.
Caput XXXVII.	 The 37th chapter.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	 When the catarrh descends to the throat and becomes long; then she is called perpendicular; if there is a large part below, round, then she is called upside down.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	 When you are done with what we said about the incision and do not make a cutting; then see that the arrow is becoming cold because of her, and is thin; then it is necessary for you to strike off her.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	 And what is added round to her, and there is no length for it, and blood, or color black, or black; but there was no sense for him; then it is necessary that you make a cutting of hers.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	 There indeed is fear above the illness.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	 "You should proceed with the second method I described earlier regarding eye lenses, and their length as before so that you could set them aside from the sun to treat a sick person's eye. You have to use his language along with its tool whose description has come before this. Then make a notch in one of two tools I mentioned for cutting open the eyelids separately.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	 "You must not strike it unless something is added to its end that is beyond nature's limits.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	 "If you strike it with more than what was mentioned before, the eye will be damaged and speaking will cease.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	 "After cutting open both eyelids you should apply a treatment for that specific purpose until the eye is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	 "If the patient becomes weak from being cut open, then you should proceed to apply heat with care and without fear or worry.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 "The method of cauterization is not the same as water. It involves placing a heated object onto your head.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	 "Then use his language with its tool that I mentioned before.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	 "Then take the heated object I mentioned to you in the previous chapter on cauterization and apply it gently but not so hard that it damages this tool's shape.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	 "Apply medicine to his eye with care as you would a delicate part of the ear.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	 "Place the tool with the medicine on top of him and let him lie there until he is healed.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	 "Hold your hand with the medicine until the patient is healed.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	 "You should place it on top of him with a quantity appropriate to the healing hour until you see that it is already becoming pale and then gently apply the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	 "If you take it gently and place the patient's head on top of his hand while wrapping both hands with a bandage around the tool along its length.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	 "Once you have cleaned it [the wound], then apply a cautery.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	 Then remove the cautery if she begins to fester and die after three days or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	 If you need to apply further medicine after the cautery, reapply it immediately; and remove the cautery around its edges with a cotton soaked in butter and cleanse it with that which is around its edge from medicine; and tie it down with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	 And after removing the external one with a washcloth soaked in vinegar, and when he begins to choke from that, until he is cured (i.e., gets better).
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	 Thus cauterization for healing cuts is safer than many fears
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	 And sometimes cauterization works just as well and more subtly than a cut; for it is cured with smothering (i.e., suffocating) and in that way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	 Mix saltpeter, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and seah, and chamomile, and abrotan, and others from herbs; and gather them all together, or some of those into a vessel, and put them in vinegar, and let them boil: then the boiled mixture is to be poured through a sieve into the middle of an earthenware bowl (i.e., a mortar), on which should be placed the instrument for grinding in that manner.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	 It is to be beaten out with the back of a spoon or by air; and put down one end into an earthenware bowl (i.e., mortar), which contains the powdered ingredient slowly dripping in water until it rises up to the surface over a strainer, until the mixture becomes very smooth.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	 Then reapply it many times until she improves (i.e., gets better).
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	 And let no one begin to perform this practice with impure hands or fingers.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	 Add a washcloth, so that you wipe your hands clean of impurities before touching the cautery; and do not let anyone perform this practice unless their fingers are warm from washing (i.e., warmed by water).
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	 If you do not have this instrument at hand, then take a strainer and remove the mixture from its edge; so that the mouth may not be burned by water because it prevents the burning of the mouth; and this is for good practice with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	 Extracting (removing) the spine and bones from meat
Caput XXXVIII.	 Part 80
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	 It may come from either a fish's spine or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	 Therefore it is to be removed from the things which are on top of a fallen victim (body) after you have spoken with its instrument before the sun, and it is declared by you as what is found in the body.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	 And if it does not appear to you and be hidden from view (in the body), then it is required that you prepare a sick person before they eat food with their mouth in their stomach before it is eaten
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	 If it has been separated by the instrument, then it must be added to meals (food).
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	 If a sick person cannot eat anything that is liquid (such as milk or bread), they can drink sea sponges soaked in brine and then swallow them.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	 After it has been moved to a place where the spine is (the body) or its mouth, it must be eaten immediately.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	 If not eaten with what we have said above, then you are to use the instrument from a lump as follows.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	 It is more than double the size of a radius, and at its extremity there are pains which it passes through with ease when brought into contact with his throat; and he himself has lifted up (his) head from above (the body).
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	 And let him strike with his own fist, so that he does not come into contact with the spit or vomit (spitback), and thrusts it with him mouth, or spine, or introduces it by means of his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	 Indeed if the sick person introduces it into him (the instrument), that is better because of his knowledge of where to place what was taken away: and he pushes down with a downward motion or takes hold with his hand on top of the instrument until it has been eaten all in accordance with the amount prepared for him.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	 Extracting (removing) the blood sucker
Caput XXXIX.	 Part 90
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	 When bloodletting is performed with the same instrument that I advised earlier, and before it has been applied, consider this: place it near the sun so as to dry up any surplus moisture from its surface; then apply this [instrument] where the sun shines after it was spoken into your presence.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	 If therefore your bloodletting instrument falls on the lancet, remove both and gently cleanse them
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	 If it is not possible with both: take the lancet and gently introduce it into the mouth of the patient, until it reaches their throat; then introduce the iron cannula heated by fire into this same place.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	 Do this many times: And let the patient refrain from drinking water throughout the day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	 Then take a full draught of cold water and open his mouth into it; let him drink from this until he has closed his mouth with it; do not allow anything to come out of the mouth while drinking, except for a short time after that, using your hand only; wait one hour after another before doing so.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	 The bloodletting instrument falls on him when he drinks water
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	 If otherwise is not possible with it as I said before: take the patient's nose and gently introduce the instrument into his nostrils; then use this same instrument for fumigation [bleep]
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	 Do this many times, because she is leaving
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	 The method of operation is as follows during fumigation; take a vessel where there are the handles with fire [bleep]
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	 Then proceed with the fumigation and place the patient's mouth on the cannula; press his mouth so that no more of the fumigation can enter until you know for sure if it has completed its task in bloodletting.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	 Bloodletting falls immediately after the fumigation
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	 If not fallen yet: do this many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	 And let the patient stay silent and eat salt [bleep] and other food, but no water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	 It is necessary that I depart with this treatment regime.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	 This is the form of the instrument by which a blood-sucking creature is removed when it falls upon the veins.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	 It is similar to a bite (enclosure), as you would say: unless there is inserted into it a force which reaches up the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	 It has an extremity similar to that of a swallow (a sort of bird), where there is sharpness and cleanness; when it comprehends anything, it does not let go of it at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	 Of the opening of a sheath for arrows, and their cutting off, and care in general.
Caput XL.	 Head (size).
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	 Arrows have many species and many forms; according to what has been recalled of them, namely one kind (the compound) and another single kind in this book; and there are others by perforations of theirs, and their cutting off in two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	 Of one kind is from a sheath (species), and what he comprehends through the moisture.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	 The second way is by reason of places where it happens from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	 When an arrow falls on the head, it is another by accident from an arrow falling into the anus; and an arrow falls upon a place of flesh, it is another by accident from an arrow falling at the joining points; to each one there belongs its judgment according to the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	 And from arrows there are those that should not be perforated unless after the maturity of the sinew in them, and its completion; and from these (are arrows), which ought to be perforated when they are raw, but do not mature according to their purpose.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	 As arrows that are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	 Because arrows when they fall near the joints, and it is prolonged for them, until the corruption of what is near their side perhaps the ligaments are torn or the veins of that joint; therefore there is a cause stronger than the contraction of those members.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	 Or an arrow falls upon a principal part; if you delay the perforation of it until maturity occurs perhaps one thing will be done to him or that member, or he himself will die.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	 "An artery is cut near the bone; therefore it must be closed so that it does not die. And you should not perform a closure without cauterization of the wound to prevent putrefaction from deep within, and allow the interior to heal as quickly as possible, or make an opening in its course (to exit) if healing does not occur.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	 "It is recommended that you know the time for closing perforations with sutures; it occurs after the completion of the complement and at the moment of administering anesthesia to relieve pain, reducing fever, lowering redness (inflammation), increasing pulse, tightening the head sutures.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	 "And it is recommended that you perform the same perforation (anastomosis) at lower location with sutures and cause it to be higher in importance: and let the opening extend throughout the length of the body if the sutures are in the hands and feet, and places for the tendons, chords, veins, arteries, and go up to all places equally where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	 "But in those which are reflected with the perforation according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	 "When you have performed the sutures on a place of flesh (ligament), then it is better to remove the perforation from him and confirm his digestion as we described in relation to the complement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	 "Because if you perforate it before that, the course of blood from him is prolonged and there are many sores and ulcers, and perhaps his lips will be closed.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	 "And some sutures will be performed according to the width of the body at need, or according to that member which is most suitable.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	 "And it is recommended to administer perforations at both ends of the sutures thinly and widely at the larger ones.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	 "And there are from the sutures where it is necessary to apply a cut; and an incision occurs when it has already been done like leather, or at its end which was dead: just as that which happened many times so you may double-take, and bubbles.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	 "Having three angles
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	 "As if cutting through a leaf's shape.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	 "Like the tongue of a man.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	 "There are sections used for administering circular and lunar sections; similar sections also from those listed above.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	 "Whoever does not have a head should be perforated with shallow cuts, or it will suffice for him to endure the pain of flat surfaces.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	 "When a large tongue is cut and has taken away much of the saliva, you should pierce it so that no part remains on him; take off the whole with one blow from him.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	 "Then the other person will drink his own saliva.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	 "Then, having taken off some of the pus a second time, you must pierce it so that no part remains on him; take off the whole with one blow from him again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	 "This should be done in stages; especially if he is weak or the woman who nurses him, or the child who is young and still a boy, or an old man who is decrepit; for it may happen that spirit of animals goes out through discharge to many times: perhaps the infirm one will die, and you might not notice.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	 "Take great care with this chapter.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	 "After you have pierced the tongue, pierce it as follows; remove and consider carefully.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	 "If there are shallow cuts or flat surfaces in the tongue, administer medicine with linen thread or a thin rope.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	 "If there are many perforations of the tongue's cuts, you must go into every single one and administer medicine.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	 "If you have cut off part of the tongue with your hand or grasped it tightly around its circumference; then take a rope of old linen and apply it until after three days.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	 "Then bandage him as before, taking care not to tear the cloth used for binding; until he is cured.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	 "If you lose a flow of blood during your surgery, then immediately apply cold water and vinegar to the affected area; once soaked with it, place this over the location where the flow of blood is most intense.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	 "If a bleeding flow of blood persists, you should immediately administer the remedy and preservation, as written about in our book's locations. And if you divide it into parts.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	 "If there is a burning pain (in the time of hernia or after a fall), you should apply cold water mixed with oil and warm oil; place them on the locations.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	 "If it is an ulcer (or sores are present), you should apply cold water mixed with oil and warm oil; or vinegar mixed with oil to the affected area.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	 "Until death comes the third time (after three days), as we have said before: you should remove and administer to him what has helped him until now, so that he may be healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	 "Therefore, it is necessary for everyone universally to apply the remedy of the cure in the same way.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	 "According to half a day's division, I have said about every treatment how it proceeds individually towards the cure of his ailment.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	 "About the cuts which occur on the head.
Caput XLI.	 "Chapter one hundred and eleven: About the scalp.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	 "There are cuts on the head from various causes; such as from scratching by birds.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	 "Their kind is many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	 "From these are the pocks; and from them too, which are like limes in moisture (or sores on the scalp), but not so numerous as those previously mentioned. And also from these, where lice and combs touch it.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	 "About the extraction of all things: this is not done out of fear when among their extracts no contrary effect on the artery occurs.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	 "The operation of their sections is to try it with an instrument whose shape was after this one called 'Intromission', until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	 "If there is moisture, then remove it with a sharp incision along its length according to the depth of the transverse incision; in this manner.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	 "Begin with an incision from point B to the line G. After removing the moisture, remove any moisture that remains and do not discard it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	 "Certainly; if anything remains after having removed what was there.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 "Then immerse the incision with Egyptian unguent if it is present at that moment; and if not, in water or salt-water, and release him until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	 "The incision will become rotten from what remains after having been released.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 "Then apply the Egyptian unguent for the second and third time, until it stops releasing anything after having been released; at that moment you must heal him with unguent.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	 "If a knot remains in the pincer, remove it according to this form; with the cross incision and cut through both incisions; and shave off all hair except that which covers him; and compare your strength in removing his garment.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	 "If you encounter the opposite of what I've shown you here, then do as I show you after this.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	 "Do it similarly with the pincer if there is a stone; remove it by incision and cure according to what I've shown you.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	 "The incision of the pincer for removing stones is easier, because there are few blood vessels and moisture in it.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	 "Sometimes certain pincer hooks are in the heads of some people who do not have a lot of moisture.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	 "This is because I have taken the female pincer by its handle and inserted it into a stone just as hard and rough; if someone were to strike against this with force while pulling him out, he would be injured.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	 "And in the cases of accidents on the heads and those that happen to boys' hands except for these pincer hooks which strike into the ears and roots of the hair; their incision is a superficial one.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	 Always make an incision below where necessary in order that the vessels may be freed from the lower part of them towards the lower end
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	 Then attend to it as you deem appropriate with regard to the care given
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	 Section of the strangulated parts in the neck
Caput XLII.	 Head - 12th
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	 These wounds occur on the neck and under the arms and the thighs, sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	 And over that which is caused by these wounds on the neck there are one and many, and they come from a cut made inside: and every strangulated part is within its own tunic as it is with knots and the heads of hair, as we have shown.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	 There are many kinds of strangulation.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	 And from them there also come stones; and from them comes what is a moistening of the breath; and from them come venomous ones that do not obey care.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	 For that which comes from them through a good disposition and whose color is close to the skin, and moves towards every part of it, and is not attached with the neck veins nor with the guide vein or with the artery, nor is deep: It should be separated by a section in its superficial part from above to below the part of the body along the line b. across the line c. d. e., and spread two lips on each side with a small finger or with many fingers if necessary as we have shown for the strangulated parts of the head, and withdraw it slowly
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	 And over caution so that no one is cut, nor the vein.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	 And it should be done gently so that you do not add your hand when you cut or upset the sick one and you do not strike what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	 If you cut someone or the artery and it prevents you from doing the operation then let a bite be given three times, or pull out the veins that are cutting blood and tie them off; loose them and release him until he is quieted by the strangulation and mollified with the vein. Or if it begins to putrefy
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	 "The nose is removed and made ready for your operation; thereafter nothing remains.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	 After removing the strophulus you should then use your finger to examine what is left of it and its surroundings; if something remains after this, then cut off those as well in order that nothing might remain.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	 If there is a great strophulus in the root of it; then you should not cut off that strophulum from its own root as follows: it must be that with twice the force of your finger and you remove her until she falls down by herself without causing any harm or pain to anyone.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	 After removing all that is below the strophulus when it has been taken out of its sheath (the knife), you should:
Deinde cura ipsum.	 Then take care of him.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	 If the strophulus is completely cut off then you should make two openings with your finger nails and immediately insert them; when you see that no more remains of it in excess.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	 If you see that it has remained because of the size of the strophulum then you should aim to make an incision in its root and remove it; and administer sutures as we have advised.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	 And if there are any secretions from the strophulus they should be perforated with a superficial incision so that you can see the location of its maturity and put an opening in it where the inferior part of the body follows as we have advised.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 After the strophulus has been perforated with a knife and these are applied as well in order to corrode what remains from corruption until you see that the wound is now dry; then take care of him immediately with your finger nails so he may be cured.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	 The excision of the epiglottis, from its attachment to the inside of the throat by accident/mistake.
Caput XLIII.	 The thirty-third head
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	 They performed this excision on the epiglottis and I did not find anyone among us who had done it; and here is their writing.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	 If the two sides are joined then it is necessary to make an incision in the epiglottis without using a tool; for otherwise all of us will be weak and sick.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	 In such a person who has cool lips on their tongue or blisters or two ulcers inside the mouth when there is no tenderness to touch with the tip of the tongue must be used as an escape hatch from damnation, provided that this happens by chance
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	 It should therefore be done so that we cut through the three or four circles of Epiglotim with a notch, or at least one notch; by this means, which is between two circles in length, it must be made into an escape hatch from damnation, provided that this happens by chance.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	 If the surgeon is timid, then he should make a cut on the tongue with a knife.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	 Then when it reaches to the canal, water will run from its veins if anything is seen coming out of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	 Then we cut off the notch that we made; and it is called an escape hatch from damnation because of this, when it happens by chance.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	 And he loosens up a closed ulcer at some point in time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	 With the removal of any moment when he is fearful of an introduction, he cuts both lips and removes them without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	 Then administer medicines that grow flesh until such time as they are cured.
Inquit Albucasis.	 It is finished with Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	 The summary of this lecture that we mentioned is as follows; the exposition was not given unless they saw that a particular one among them had already been taken by their tongue to be sick, and then he became better than death: therefore, they were commanded to cut off the Epiglotim so that he could breathe over the ulcer which he has in his mouth for some time, and it would have been well: and because of this reason, they were commanded to let open ulcers until their evil was consumed, and is a malice in three days, and nearly as much; therefore, then they immediately cut off the ulcer themselves so that they could heal him, until he was cured.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	 That which I heard through you is that an attendant struck the head with a mallet and cut off its top portion, after which he inserted it into the gullet of his throat.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	 I was summoned to attend him, and then I struck her with a mallet and wounded her similarly as death does to the living.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	 Therefore, having withdrawn from the vessel through which he had entered the blood, I drew out the severed head.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	 Therefore I was enraged that she did not retreat and flee, but he who had entered through the vessel withdrew from it.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	 I therefore ordered my servant and healed him so that he became well; but the attendant did not cause any injury to her except for a slight scratch on her neck from which she recovered after some days, with better dispositions towards others.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	 Therefore I say that there is no fear of the saw.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	 Of the cut throat surgery.
Caput XLIIII.	 The 44th chapter
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	 This chapter is called the 'Great Hernia of the Throat' because it is very large and as red as the body; it occurs frequently in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	 It can be either natural or accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	 In nature there is no reason for it.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	 Accidentally, in two ways; one of which resembles a knot on the beak of a bird.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	 Another way is similar to what happens when an artery is cut from a knot.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	 And there is fear and it should not be allowed to bleed into itself with a knife unless the blood which has entered through an opening is bound up; and you should test its strength by inserting a finger in it, or else it may strangle your finger as it does mine.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	 Therefore if you have inserted into it a knot like that of a pigeon's beak and it is not held up by anything in the vein, then dry out quickly, just as knots are dried, so that one may remove it from what holds its entrance closed; but if it does not hold on to something inside itself or outside itself, you should examine everything completely about him.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 After cleansing with it what needs to be done through care will be done.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	 Of the section over the seeds of the nodus.
Caput XLV.	 The head is 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	 There are many species of the nodus, and I have already recited all the species for them to be divided. It is necessary that we distinguish here between the seed (Nodus) and the excurrent (Exitus), so that if someone doubts this, let him divide again.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	 Therefore I say that when the excurrent is warm, and there are fevers, and also the death of life (uēhementes), until a superabundance of heat escapes, and decomposition completes; then, after this, they remain feverish and heated.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	 But when the seed (Nodus) is not warm, nor feverish, nor death of life, and there are those who are their own sack, which is according to the color of the body; and it receives as much as a cicer does, and it happens like that, greater and less.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	 And there are two kinds in this way: either with a pang or with keeping of moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	 The colors of the moisture are many, according to what I have said about division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 Therefore it is necessary when you come to care for the seed (Nodus) that you inspect him and ask about him first of all with an instrument called Intromissum, according to what follows after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	 The mode of interrogation is determined by the seed (Nodus) as well, that you take this instrument and lead him into a more humid place which comes before it; and then you will slowly bring your fingers with him until you know that the instrument has already entered his skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	 Then last, you take hold of his hand according to the measure of its magnitude after this.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	 And then remove the instrument and consider that which has gone out into the excurrent (Exitus) of his.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	 If then there is flowing moisture at any time, whatever the color may be; then dry him superficially according to what I have said about others.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	 "If you do not believe that moisture is present in the incision, then know that there is a chill [i.e., it has become cold]: dry out this with a cross-shaped section and apply it as prescribed: suspend it together with sinews; and remove all skin from every part of him gently.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	 "However, if the skin is detached from the incision during the procedure and it is impossible to remove her [i.e., the patient], then take hold of her firmly until she is restored; for otherwise, nothing else will be saved.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	 "If something remains after this except a little or much [i.e., the patient], then make use of the cord according to its greatest usefulness.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 "If you are sick and something remains from it just a little bit [i.e., the patient], then apply leeches to your completion as recommended by some with corrosive and acute fluids: suspend them above his head in order that they may not touch anything cold; care for him together with the rest, so that he is restored.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	 "If there are many leeches [i.e., a larger number of them], then place two mouths in his ears and care for him with whatever is injected.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	 "If it is contrary to the pulse or not [i.e., you are unable to apply leeches], then make an appointment and arrange a place for the application, and release him from stricture by two days at most; or three, until there be no longer putrefaction of the vein: thereafter return to removing that which remains from Nodus.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	 "Of instruments used in making incisions and perforations.
Caput XLVI.	 "Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	 "Here are the shapes of the introducers [i.e., leeches] and their three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	 "From these come the great ones, the middle-sized ones, and the small ones.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	 "Let the introducers be of iron, so that their extremities may rest in a manner conducive to receiving the blood into the veins near at hand.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	 These are the forms of experience, that is to say, perforation: and one of them is called a needle, which means piercing through or cutting into three pieces; there are three varieties
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	 And among these is great, medium, and small
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	 They unite together as a means to penetrate through the openings or holes, extraction (removal) of things from it, fistulas that occur because of its presence between those openings, and bubbles arising out of it which is in contact with the openings/holes
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	 And others are round and narrow like the great needle mentioned before (that is to say, a large needle), thin and narrow like a thin needle, or slender and thin like an arrowhead, which may be used with cord (of course) from the flint, or iron, or bronze
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	 And among those are improvements that occur from the flint (or other material), which means that they can be used as knives and scalpels
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	 And among those there are improvements in using the black lead, which means that they can be used to puncture holes and make fistulas (fist-like formations) with their hardness, as a result of reflections on its surface when reflecting off of them
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	 And there are also three varieties of needles
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	 Because of these, there are long, medium and short needles depending on the size of the fistulas and their tightness respectively.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	 The forms for removing things through openings or holes, which have many varieties
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	 Because of these there are simple forms like the ones used by physicians or surgeons (which have three varieties), such as small ones, large ones and medium ones respectively.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	 And among those there are blind needles which also have three varieties
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	 And among those there are needles that hold two different sizes and three varieties, and there are needles that hold three different sizes with three varieties, and all of them are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	 These are the forms of scalpel that cut and remove knots (scalpel means cutting instrument), holes or openings, which have three varieties; among those there is great, medium, and small ones respectively.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	 "The joints whose cuts are acute have sharp ones; the others do not. They are not applied thusly unless they get a cut through which there is fear of cutting, or a knife wound: so that he may be healed through them and find tranquility greater than when he was inexcoriated.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	 "These are the three species [of animals].
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	 "They flow from the air, and are similar to radio; when they come upon [one's] tongue there is a burning feeling of alcohol: and in the lateness of night there is hidden Spatumilis obscure, and it flows towards the interior part and exterior part like you.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	 "The shape of the Spatumilis that hides itself between the fingers when there is a cut through [the skin] towards the post; they do not perceive themselves being touched by an infirmity: and are three species, great, middle, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	 "The foam of the venoms when they are drawn off with the flow of blood; there are three species great, middle and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	 "They flow from the air or through the veins in circles greater than their length; like you [see] them.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	 "And it is necessary that the great and small species of venoms are given to you for you to draw off blood through them with a certain velocity at the necessity.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	 "But you do not apply them to make the blood flow in all parts of the body; but only at the places where there is flesh; like a hawk's claws and wings and a hawk's leg and breast and throat and belly and vent and anus and others with flesh wounds, moist.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	 "And when they are instruments of small and similar shapes for the fists; according to their shape, with which blood is drawn off when it flows from a place phlebotomy or at an incision or artery; and sometimes they are in circles according to this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	 On the care of men who become breastfed from women's breasts
Caput XLVII.	 Head 47
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	 When men are suckled from a woman's breast until they fall asleep [i.e., when the nipples harden during sleep and become engorged], until the breasts of women nourish them, but after this nourishing period is over, their milk will cease to flow.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	 Whoever wants to prevent this should take a circular saw section of the nipple along its curved path [from below up to above], so that it may be removed from the line [i.e., the edge of the breast]. After this, all the engorged part will be shaved off.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	 Afterward apply a poultice with fresh application of medicine
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bind two lips with sutures and attend to it until it is healed.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 If the nipple falls downwards and becomes engorged due to its own size, just like what happens with women: then you must cut it off in two halves along a circular path from below up to above, so that one of them is kept on each side at their ends until the larger one contains the smaller. Afterward remove the cuts and apply as previously mentioned sutures and poultice [for healing].
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	 If you are not able to make a complete incision on it as recommended earlier due to concern for the nurse or because of blood flow: then apply a poultice with a corrosive unguent and remove it until it is corroded by that which remains after cutting through the engorged part.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then attend to it until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	 On the perforations of the breast caused by Titillius.
Caput XLVIII.	 Head 48
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	 These perforations caused by Titillius are of the type seen in the hardened veins [Strophulas], which hold onto drops and are surrounded by moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 What are to be done with those which contain moisture? It should be cut off [the nipple] using a circular saw along its path from below up to above so that all of it is removed from the breast and then apply the older poultice until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 In that manner he cut off his hand and treated it with a salve applied to the site of injury until healing occurred
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	 If the amputated member was of the type with knots (Strophular), then it should be placed on top of it as we described for equal sections over Strophulas.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	 If the wound extends downward to emit blood then apply a cautery over it as we described for the previously mentioned section of the same procedure.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	 Regarding the amputation due to artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	 Section 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	 When the artery is cut and the skin above it is sutured then many wounds occur from that amputation including similar wounds to the vein as well as swelling up.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	 The signs that indicate an amputation due to artery or vein are as follows: when the amputation is for the artery it will be long and deeply seated into the body; if you cause a pinching of your fingertips there's a feeling like something is being strangled (stridor).
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	 The one due to vein is round on the outer part of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	 The section above this amputation is a mistake and is most pronounced on the underarms, groin, neck, and in many parts of the body; it is very large.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	 Therefore there should be an effort to treat him with iron and also on the edges or even at his head it is advisable.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	 Therefore above that which from the artery's swelling there should be a cut in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	 Then apply the amputation with a hook after the artery; and release her from the clothing until she is detached.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then insert below the hook and make her penetrate until you reach another place; and suture the artery with two threads as described for extracting both arteries at their places of origin.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	 Then wash the place that is between the two ligatures with a wet cloth until all of the blood from it has been washed out and treated as described for the amputation.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	 "After applying a dressing that generates pus until the ligaments fall off; then treat with ointments until healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	 "If a vein is cut through an incision and you cannot hold the wound with your hand, then you must tie it with a ligature as close to you as possible.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	 "After tying the ligature around where your hand was, and it's not tight enough, then make a second knot to tighten it further until you can pull out the other end.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	 "After tying with a ligature as I advised you earlier using the ligature as a double loop around it.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	 "If the ligature is removed from the thread then tie another knot with a second loop of the ligature underneath at the incision point; pull hard and your four fingers should make it tight.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	 "After tying the ligature around its middle until you are ready to remove it; then cut off any excess skin and release the ligature.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	 "After placing a bandage soaked in oil on top of it, massage gently.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	 "Then apply the dressing that works with ointments until healed.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	 "From ligature from nerve damage by torsion of nerves.
Caput L.	 "The head of Lucius.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	 "Just like what happens with an artery and vein, just as it does with a nerve; if the impact is from a blow or excessive force then it will happen to the ligature also.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	 "The rest of his body becomes pale and is in many positions without pain; when it's pulled with a lot of force, he feels dizzy.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	 "The ligature cannot be pulled up deep into the body without pain and is pulled only towards all parts of it; not towards the front or back.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	 What is important about these ligatures [connections] for sutures is that they must not be cut with a knife
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	 Indeed, the cutting of a connection would lead to contraction.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	 In that which is from them on the head or forehead, you should find it with a blunt edge.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	 If a string has become slack, then hold it with tweezers and clip it off at its base.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if the string is long, then suspend it with a hook and peel away from its base; thereafter clip off the excess, hold on to it and care for it until it is healed.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	 The cutting of the string having occurred inside the body.
Caput LI.	 The head.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	 Some of those individuals were frequently encountered along their way and among other members of their group, who are called Fungali, due to a similarity with mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	 Of whose root is soft, and of whose head is large, and the lips they have are broad.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	 And it from them is slack; and its size is great.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	 I have now heard of a man who had two in his body which were greater than anything else that was similar to the mushrooms; there was no difference between them except for the size of their roots and they parted with their lips, they moistened themselves always from those things.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	 Then I cut them off with a knife and weighed one of them at X denarius and eight sesterces, the other at six denarius; and the operation was by cutting them through [or] piercing as you consider here if they are damp and the color is white, moist, soft roots.  Then clip it off with a blunt edge in your presence, let there be your careful treatment of fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 Many are expelled at the time of cutting his blood is much; therefore if you see it flowing [or] bleeding, then cauterize him right away.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 If you see a weak and fearful person cut from his blood with a knife, then take the thread that has been made loose from his body and tie it to him; this is how we have said so, and release him in two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	 Then add air tight
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	 Do not let go of the seal until it is completely sealed and then removed so that it can be discarded without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	 If the seal on the heart is too large for the incision to be performed easily and safely; especially that which is within the middle of it.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	 However, there may exist a way in order to decrease its size if you are skilled enough.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	 After that seal it so that it does not leak.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then take care of it until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	 And remember that if you wish to make an incision on it and remove a part of its color, few senses, face, it is a very dangerous operation; I will be with you after the remembrance of Cancer when I come.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	 Care for the great Womb.
Caput LII.	 The second head
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	 The greatness of the womb is born from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	 Or if it is separated through a tear on the top; and goes out of that way, or from inside through an intestine, according to which it happened among the other tears.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	 Or if it is separated by a flow of blood out of the vein; or from an artery, according to what was left behind.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	 Or if it is cut off because of a knot within it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	 If it is separated through a tear in the womb and then goes out of that way; at this moment its appearance becomes similar to the body's color, gentle without pain, and stays hidden from view for a long time.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	 And if it is separated because of the exit of an intestine; at that moment its position remains as long as we have remained there and is more diverse in appearance.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	 As soon as you take hold of it with your fingers, it is concealed; and after that it returns forthwith, but may be painful if there is any resistance from the womb or its surroundings: and it becomes much more noticeable in relation to the entrance of the belly.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	 If because of moisture; is gentle at that moment when you take hold of it with your hand and there are no obstacles or additions.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	 When it is due to blood, then with these signs appears a letter towards the dark region
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	 If it's due to meat death, then its appearance is an A (uppercase) letter towards the dark region
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	 If because of excess fat or poison, then his touch is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	 And the operation on that place is to be considered then if the greatness of the umbilical cord towards the blood vessels or veins or excess fat and poison occurs: it is necessary for you then to stop restraining his care
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	 In that place there was fear and poverty like a doctor tells about writing the letters due to the artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	 If greatness of the umbilical cord due to intestines or bile occurs: it is necessary then for you to take great care so that its desire may be fulfilled and remain in a standing position extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	 Then signs with pitch around the umbilical cord's entire circumference.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	 After that you should put it so that he may be supported by your hand upon his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	 Then around with a pitch mark on the place where you wrote with pitch around the umbilical cord's circumference.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	 After that spread the middle of the letters to the upper part with great force.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	 Then tie it around the circumference strongly using a thread or cord firmly, and let there be knot of the ligament stretched outwards.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	 After that spread out the middle of the letters on top of the ligament extended.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	 If you then catch him already tied to the ligament: then take out stretched outwards and put into his finger a pointing thumb and drive his bowels towards the interior of the stomach: if you then catch bile: then receive him with thread or cord, and strike off its excess fat from him.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	 If the opposite is to you artery or vein occurs: then surround it much
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	 After that return to your work
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	 Two skewers are taken up and inserted into them two strong stakes; then two skewers are inserted around the person who has been tied to a cross with such strong stakes as you have used so that he cannot get free.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	 Then tie the person to a stake for four places above the skewers; if you are tired of holding them and releasing their place until they become rotten from the outside, so that he falls by himself or is struck down when skillfully sharpened and becomes rotten.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of him with the ointments which are necessary until he recovers.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	 If the eminence is from fleshly pain within him or from moisture; then you should tie his stakes as we have said so that he may be freed from them and suffer no more.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	 And take away the blood or the moisture which are within him.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	 Then take care of him until his place becomes firm again.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	 Until his cure is complete.
Caput LIII.	 The end of book 31.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	 We have spoken of the various ways to apply remedies for cancer and how one should proceed with medicines when treating him; and we recommend that iron be used along with his treatment as long as he does not become ulcerated: and it was also mentioned in this book to produce the tumor from a matrix, and caution regarding his treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	 It was also said by others that when cancer is present at the place where it can be removed; such as cancer which is in the breasts or the buttocks and in those places, from body parts tied together to remove all of him entirely, especially when he is just beginning
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	 Unless it has become big, you should not approach him with close proximity
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	 I was unable to cure someone from that person and could not find anyone before me who had cured them.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	 And the operation on him when placed as we have said is such that he may be freed from his black bile sometimes.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	 Then remove the blood and moisture if present with great force.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	 In preparation for a patient undergoing an operation
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	 Then insert the lancet into the vein
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	 Afterwards apply the lancet evenly all over him, making incisions according to the prescription; until nothing more remains from his veins: release the blood so that it flows out, and do not cut away what you did not take, lest you express a vein somewhere else; or withdraw the entire amount of blood with your hand alone, depending on how this can be done there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If anything contrary to your benefit arises from cutting into an artery, or one of the veins: then cauterize that vein; until blood is withdrawn.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then attend to him with the remaining care, until he has recovered.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	 The end of treatment for hydropsy
Caput LIIII.	 Epilogue
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	 We have finished the treatment of hydropsy as described above; and so it is with all its signs, and the care for him along with his medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	 Only the treatment of hydropsy with iron is finished; and it does not come close to the treatment of the earache, nor comes near to that of tinnitus (ringing in the ears); or it does not reach for the shortness of breath caused by hypo-sarcosis: this would be fatal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	 When you have finished treating hydropsy tinnitus with medicines, and did not affect the treatment by your medicine; then consider it.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	 If there is some weakness or other illness after hydropsy; as if it were with him another affliction beyond hydropsy, just like if he were tired and needed to drink water, or anything else of that sort; then make sure you do not treat him with iron: because this would be terrible.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	 However, if there is some excess of strength that weakens him; it does not come near to weakness because of hydropsy alone: nor the child, nor the old man either: then you must find a way for treatment in him as he sits between your hands, and the nurse afterwards expresses his drink towards lower part of stomach.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	 "Then take a small and thin skewer.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	 "Slice the two larger arteries (or veins) as sharp as possible, then slice the thinner one at its tip like a toothpick.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	 "However, be careful of some small break that may occur while passing it through the operation up to the intestine, and put a bandage on it.
Deinde considera.	 "Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	 "If generation is through the abdominal part of the intestine, then it should be stretched with a three-finger incision from below to above its belly.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	 "If generation is due to weakness in the liver, then your left section should be made from below with three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	 "And if the generation is due to weakness, then make a cut on the right side; and it should not be made so deep that he who is weak cannot pass them through.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	 "Then proceed with your tool to complete the cut.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	 "Then introduce your hand into the cut and press it in like manner as you saw before.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	 "Then pierce the skewer through until there is a void place; then the water will flow out of that place.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	 "Then take it out and introduce your tool with its shape into the hole.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	 "It is like a straw; it can be withdrawn through air or water, or by a mixture of both, the lower part being open and the three sides closed except for one on each side, so that its upper extremity is cut off just as you saw before.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	 "When the tool went into water immediately it descended quickly on top of the tool; so that half quantity of water was discharged at once.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	 "If you draw out more water than necessary at once, the weak person will either die because of a failure to breathe or suffer from a stroke if something approaches his face while he is dying.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	 Certainly! Here's a possible English translation of the Latin text you provided: "For truly true surgical skill comes from practice and experience, just as its significance is evident to you through your own efforts in training.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	 After this, take an instrument, and hold water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	 This means "When you have taken the instrument in your hand and hold water close to it (i.e., as if performing a tracheotomy), proceed by inserting it into the opening that leads out from the nostril.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	 After this, take another instrument on a different day if you find yourself unable to tolerate holding water with one; and then extract that from the water as well.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	 Perform this process for a certain number of days without fear, and ensure you avoid making any mistakes by closely observing; until the removal from water does not remain.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	 If you find yourself unable to tolerate it on a day of the illness (i.e., tracheotomy), then remove that from water and place him upon a warm bed with much moisture, and expectoration through his mouth; and then apply fire above the stomach as well, and extract smoke along with the sputum after removal from water according to what I have previously explained.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	 Do not perform surgery on infants who are born in places where urine is present.
Caput LV.	 Head L (lower case).
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	 When a child is born from its mother's womb and the head of it has not been perforated (i.e., skull fracture), or there is a narrow opening, or it lies outside its usual place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, you must promptly approach the child with a skull fracture after birth and apply gentle puffs of vapor, according to this method.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 After that, place a thin tube from the bottom into it; and hold it firmly for three days or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	 When then urine is emitted, remove him immediately and wash his mouth.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	 After that reduce it (i.e., make a tracheotomy).
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	 And if you do not place the tube, there is still an option to prevent urine that flows over his body from making him cough.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	 "For a patient with a narrowed hole [or opening], treatment is made using a plug, as we have stated earlier, until it enlarges.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	 "In those where the hole is not in its proper place, they are treated (lit.: bandaged or otherwise managed).
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	 "This is because when it [the hole] is born into the neck of a man, it cannot be lowered to its original position until he raises his hand from above.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	 "There is no generation [of offspring], therefore, since the semen cannot penetrate to its mother according to the right way; and there are bitter fruits.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	 "The method of treatment for him is that he lies on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	 "Then extend your left hand to the neck of him with his left arm; and strike off the head from its place with a sharp blow or an acute instrument, as you would cut something on a knife; so that it falls into the middle according to what is necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	 "So that you may be in a position for your blood flow during treatment.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 "Indeed many accidents have occurred to him.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 "Therefore for him with that which severed the blood and wounded his body until he is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	 "Of Albucasis concerning what happens to the neck and head of a person, and corruption, blackening (i.e., death by strangulation), and detachment.
Caput LVI.	 "The 66th chapter.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	 "Indeed many accidents occur to Albucasis among those people and there is an excess of bitter fruit [death].
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	 "And from that are two others: one malignant, one not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	 "The non-malignant should be held with a subtle sickle and severed her until she is entirely done away with.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	 "Then he puts over her the head of an Egyptian [a large, heavy fish] submerged in oil.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	 "And then with the oil and the fish-killer cure him until he is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	 "If an abscess is malignant, you must administer a cautery after cutting into it and its root.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	 "If a person has been circumcised by an al-bāṭer, do not cut into it [the foreskin], and its part is between the cutting and the outside; you must administer the al-bāṭer itself inside first until it consolidates. Then cure him externally: because when you cure both at once, neither of them will be cured before.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	 "And there are also cases where an abscess occurs on the testicles and the cutting procedure goes black or corrupts.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	 "Therefore, you must cure everything that is already infected and corrupted, or has already become corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	 "Then apply a mixture of the powder from the testicles and herbs that crush weeds or thistles.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 "And then cure it with the remaining treatment until it is cured.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	 "If a bleeding occurs from blood flow, you must administer a crescent-shaped cautery along this shape.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	 "A cautery is suitable for simultaneous use in two cases: bleeding and wounds when they become corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	 "If the head of a man is cut off and destroyed at once, then you must immediately insert into its meat with the male privy channel from a lead pipe so that it may fall over him.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	 "In another case where the cutting procedure is performed from a head injury and this does not occur unless it's on someone whose circumcision was cured and there is no requirement for an external cut; or sometimes it occurs due to wounds elsewhere, so you must therefore cure her with a rope-like ointment until the ligament is solved and the head of the man is released from all parts.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	 "If it's difficult to determine whether this occurs due to a wound or the circumcision procedure itself, then you must administer something from the head of the man and from the circumcision procedure.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	 When a small incision is made, it may be penetrated through its own subtlety or by another instrument
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	 Afterwards, separate the incision from the scalp with a wet cloth that has been previously soaked in cold water so as to prevent adhesion
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	 After which, it was treated with a heated needle until it set
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	 For the correction of children's mistakes and their care from errors that may occur
Caput LVII.	 Chapter Seventy Two
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	 Circumcision is not a solution to continuality like other nails; however, if it comes from our operation, with our care and use for him becomes proper for children, it is necessary that we indicate in this operation the better one and the more suitable for salvation.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	 Therefore, I say that the ancients did not write about circumcision in any of their books because they are not used according to their laws and only what we have acquired through experimentation is written.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	 What is important is that I use a greater portion of the art and phlebotomist to make the world better; circumcision with new tools, and wounds; and they are used in pain, and ligature with thread, and incision with knife.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	 I have already tested all these methods, but I did not find a better one to make the world better with thread and ligature.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	 Because when making the world better with new tools, it often escapes the skin.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	 The two parts of an incision have two tunics; so that one part of the incision must be on top and hold back the lower tunic; therefore it is necessary to cut through the upper tunic until you reach another incision or future pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	 And when making the world better through needles like sutures, that is, fingers, which are used by sews, it cannot be cut off from a man's arm member; because perhaps it will enter into his hole.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	 But when making the world better with a knife, it may give iron and ruin your work; and indeed children are born with nature to be this way, and many are born like that, so they do not improve the world; I have already heard of this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	 Mundification is done with forceps and ligature with thread; this [act] brought me good fortune as the cut on top was like one below in severity
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	 When you use both hands for this purpose and align their forces, two cuts of equal severity are made at once during the operation; after which a compression is applied in such a way that all the excess flesh is drawn together from every part without falling off any part.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 The proper way to perform the operation is as follows: you will have to estimate and measure carefully, especially for children if they understand better; otherwise, do not tie it too tightly with a thread of your own hand, but leave it until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	 Then let him enjoy and learn in whatever way is possible for you to do this thing with the help of his intelligence.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	 Then let him stand on your prepared height with both hands free; do not let him lie down, and make an invisible incision on one hand or below the foot to prevent any child from seeing them without using the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	 Then insert your hand into his and blow out the blood with it; then draw up his head to prevent him from going down completely.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	 After that, you will have to clean yourself after wiping off the excess flesh.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	 Then tie a knot with twice as much thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	 After that, tie it with even more ligature below to prevent him from escaping further.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	 Then hold on firmly with your index finger and thumb; keep the lower knot tight, then cut between the two knots.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	 After that, blow out the blood from his head to prevent him from escaping quickly or going down completely.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then let the blood flow slowly for a while; lay aside some of it on top to make a poultice with roasted wheat or oil recently prepared in a way that when cooked in water with vinegar and crushed together with recent olive oil is beneficial: leave him like this until another day, and take care of him with the remaining treatment to cure his wounds.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	 This is a medical term that refers to the process of removing a tumor from the body using surgery
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	 This Latin text describes the anatomy of the human limbs and their relative lengths to one another. The first part refers to the lower extremities (feet), while the second part refers to the upper extremities (hands). It states that both pairs of extremities have the same length ratio, meaning they are proportionate in size when compared with each other.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	 A mistake that occurs during surgery is the loss of all or part of the skin due to injury inside it at the time of cutting (incision).
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	 Therefore, you should make an incision during your turn, using your finger in front of the place where it is to be made, and cut it at its same length as the other one.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	 If you cannot hold her with your finger, then remove her using a probe and cut her then.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	 If three days have passed and the remaining part that is swollen under the cloth has become hard as a rock, then release it (let go of the grip), until it becomes cool to touch, you cut off what remains with ease, and cut it at its prepared length, so that your sword will hit it.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	 It won't cause any harm to him/her
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	 Therefore, let us treat that which we have removed from the bowels with care and apply the remedy for removing things from the bowels to it: if an incision is made above its measure (length), allow it to go upwards towards its upper limit without causing any harm to him/her.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore let us treat that which we have said until he becomes well.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	 On the subject of removing a hernia from within the body through an incision.
Caput LVIII.	 Title of the next section.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	 The retention of urine in the bladder is relieved by draining off the obstruction with a stone or frozen blood, pus, or a growth from within it, and similarly to those by our methods of treatment when necessary.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	 If this bladder obstruction does not yield to removal by stone or frozen blood, pus or growth from within it, then let him lie on his side until he is cured of the retained urine above his waist.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	 After making a hole in his foot and extending it from the top of his back as far as possible, he ties up any remaining part with cord.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	 He stretches out the bladder through an incision in the neck to expel the lapis from behind: why was this necessary?
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	 If this were not possible with him as we said, and the urine-retaining muscle is above it, then you should administer the extraction of his bladder using an instrument called a syphon, its shape like a siphon pipe made from lead or any other heavy metal, but thin enough to be bent easily.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	 And the way of leaving urine through him is by tying a double knot on his penis and pulling it tightly enough to ensure that no more urine comes out as long as he holds his breath; if there is anything left in the thread from the urethra after he releases his breath, you should insert this into the syphon tube at its lower end.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	 After using the syphon tube for this purpose, you can let him lie down on his back and lubricate him gently as before; bind up his bladder with a double knot or with butter if need be, and lead his urethra out of its sheath with olive oil-based lubricant, olive oil alone, or hot water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	 After inserting the syphon tube into him gently and ensuring it reaches to the base of his urethra.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	 And you tie off the top knot from around his navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	 After inserting the syphon tube into him gently and ensuring it reaches to the Vesica, you now proceed with the extraction from within this sheath: do not follow these steps as described here unless you are using a specific tool for this purpose that has been designed specifically for this job, because its design may involve winding and twisting.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	 And you extend the thread gently with urine.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	 The bladder will follow the thread.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	 After this you extract the bladder and run urine through its urethra; repeat with him and do not stop until all of his urine has been drained out.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	 Of the quality of sponges used in clepsydras
Caput LIX.	 Head XI
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	 When a cut occurs on the sponge or blood coagulates in it, or pus accumulates and distills from it with medicines; then there is to be used an instrument called Clepsydra whose shape we have just described.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	 It is deaf, that is, sealed up
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	 And in it there are three openings: two on one side and one on the other side just like you do.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	 And the outlet is closed off so that it may expel something without any addition; but when anything is pulled out of its power by humidities it draws it back again to length: according to what clepsydra does, it projects pitch [tar] into flames just like Greek fire on battlements.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	 So that you may pour out the humidity into the sponge; and when pulled towards the upper part of clepsydra by its power it will be drawn into the opening of clepsydra by its moisture: but when something is expelled towards the superior direction, then the humidity will be drawn back in to the outlet of clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	 Then bring that part within its chamber according to what we have described as a chamber.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	 And then drive out the humidity with that which pulled it towards the sponge immediately and quickly so that he may become weary of her.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	 The shape of the soft sponge to be used in clepsydras.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	 Shall be made from brass or bronze; whose head shall be of a height like that of a small bowl and beneath it there shall be an opening into which the ligature may fall.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	 Then take the sponge by its edges and place within it humidity for clepsydra to use.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	 And then tie a strong ligature with double cord into the two openings so that its heat may be greater than that of fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	 Then bring that part within the chamber of clepsydra according to what we have described as a chamber; after which tie your hand above it with a humidity seal securely: so that he may become weary of her for she has already exhausted herself upon the sponge.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	 If you don't have a knife with you right now, take this broken one and use it to make a circle, then cut through all its thickness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	 Then put the thread firmly into these holes as tightly as before.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	 After making a circle, you will secure it just like we did before, when you put that which was wet with water and oil into the container.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	 After securing it to an instrument (the knife), continue making a circle with it just as you did before when using the knife and your hand; until water becomes wet from the blade.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	 From extracting the lapis
Caput LX.	 The end of the passage
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	 I have spoken about the species of lapis and its treatment with medicines, and distinguished between different kinds of lapsides born in kidneys, liver, spleen, and skin; and also mentioned the whole sign of the stone: and distinguished where the operation takes place with hand and cut off; and that the lapis is generated by the stone itself, which appears as a figment on the knife edge. And I am telling this to you now when presented in front of me.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	 Therefore, I say that the lapis is most often produced by children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	 And from the signs of it (the stone), urine flows out like water with its subtlety; and you will see a white hare appear there, who is injured by that same hand's sword and works hard while being pulled along by her and many times she falls to the ground.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	 After this urine will flow out from it with him as a boy does; and you will see that one of them (the stone) stands erect among them all.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	 The healing for children comes from it, which brings about a cure in 14 years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	 And the treatment of an old person is difficult.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	 However among young people it is common (the treatment), which is within the lapis and his who has a bigger lapis the cure is easier; if small, then the cure for him is lighter.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	 "Firstly it is necessary to loosen the stiff limbs with a cord so that they may be opened up.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	 After this the stiff limb is taken in hand and opened up by stretching it with both hands downwards towards the depths so that a vein may be opened leading to the heart; or if there is no vein at all nearby, then relief should be sought from some distant point upwards.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	 "Then place him between your hands prepared so that his hand is beneath the cord of yours; in this way the whole vein may be opened downwards towards the lower part.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	 After which it should be sought for outside if you wish to open a vein completely from below upwards.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	 If therefore you find the vein empty of blood, then immediately with a sharp cut above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	 If therefore the vein does not yield to your touch at all, then it is necessary that you withdraw with oil your left hand if the limb is a boy; or else withdraw the middle finger of yours if it is youthfully complete and insert him into your own arm: and you must seek for the vein while he is beneath your digit until he comes from below the vein.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	 Afterwards press above him with your finger and drive him out against the place from which his vein is; and you should be prepared to receive the hand that he may give it towards the exterior: and another of yours, that it may extend its fingers towards the higher part: and another one, so that it may remove a cut beneath its fingertips in the part where the sectioning was made.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	 After this is an incision of the vein.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	 And find there what is between the arm and the fingertips on the left side; make a cut above him over the vein: place your finger in his anus: and then it should be made for an external cutting that may be wide, and an internal one that must be narrow according to how much of the vein's exit can occur without being larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	 But if you compress your finger which is in the anus of the vein near to the cutting and he will be removed with difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	 "You know that from a stone there are angles and margins, for which it is difficult to exit because of this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	 And if you come from soft things like membranes or rounded ones, then exiting is easy for him/her.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	 Therefore, to one with angles and margins add a slit (fissure).
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	 If not able to be inserted like that then you should insert it beneath him in a subtle manner with the help of a delicate tool or by having an extended hand for his extremity which is similar to the moon's shape and can grip the stone and not let go from its hold: or by inserting something under him.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	 If you are unable to insert it above then widen the hole (fissure) as much as possible.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	 If it causes bleeding remove it with a finger or hand.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	 However if the stone is more than one then first move to your mouth using a large spoon.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	 Then strike above it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	 After that pull down the other ones similarly in this manner.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	 If it is very large then ignorance arises as to how you should slice off a big piece of it.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	 Because one of the pairs was weakened or ill, either it died from drinking a strong urine mixture or it was sliced off by someone else because its location is not secure all around itself (it cannot be protected everywhere).
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	 Indeed the expulsion of him should happen until he escapes or it is broken with his own force until he pulls himself out forcefully (from inside).
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	 When you have completed your operation then press the hollow bone with a hard substance such as lead or dragon's blood and hold him there firmly until he pulls himself out forcefully (from inside).
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	 Afterwards the weak one lies over his own head without support or help from ligaments and it remains like that for three days.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	 When you have freed him, fill in a hole with water mixed with oil (a mixture of olive oil is recommended) until he pulls himself out forcefully.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	 "After cleansing with a mild soap and water, then apply the healing ointment.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	 "If it happens that a cold object touches the wound and causes frostbite or burns; and similar injuries occur - as if blood froze in a vessel and urine is prevented from flowing out with it, and it is known by the discharge of blood mixed with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	 "Then place your finger into the wound and extract its blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	 "If left untreated, it can lead to infection of the vessel (vein) or putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	 "After cleansing with vinegar and water, then apply any remedy that agrees with the cure.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	 "It is necessary for the whole course of treatment to be observed so that two veins and a single vein can be cured.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	 "If the stone is flat and lies in the urine bladder; it appears there, and must be prevented from exiting - then cure him with what you put on before you cut into the bladder.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	 "Many times I have practiced this course of treatment; but that's it for me.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	 "It is as follows: the trocar has a small opening with a narrow blade; its shape is triangular, and it is held fast by a wooden handle.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	 "Then take a thread and bind it tightly under the stone so that it does not slip out of its place.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	 "Then insert the trocar with the narrow blade into the stone; hold it gently against its place so that it does not slip out of position. Then take the hand holding the thread and carefully move the stone to one side, then withdraw the stone while keeping your hand pressed tightly against the stone's surface: you will see where the wound has been made.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	 "The urine is discharged immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	 "Then take your hand and remove what remains of the stone from its outer surface on the urine side.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	 "The stone will break up; it becomes fluid with urine, and is cured by that.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	 If you are not provided for this care, due to something that prohibits it from him, then tie the first thread under a stone and the second above the stone
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	 Then dry off over the stone between the two tied threads.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	 Then remove it (the dried thread).
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	 After you tie a knot, and open up the frozen blood that is inside the vein.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	 And it is not necessary to tie the thread under the stone unless you want it to go back up: and a different thread above only if when released after going through the stones goes down with its skin at its own place, and cooperates in healing the wound: and because of that, when tying the superior thread so that it cuts off the lower part, so that it comes out at your upper part, to heal the wound as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	 The extraction of women's thighs (a surgical procedure).
Caput LXI.	 Chapter 11
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	 It is not generated by a stone in women
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	 If you encounter one of those stones, then the cure becomes difficult and is prohibited due to many reasons.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	 The cause for this difficulty may be that women are stronger than men
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	 Another reason is because you do not come across a woman who becomes a doctor when she is pure or with the help of her husband.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	 The third reason may be that you do not encounter a woman who knows this art and practice well, especially when it comes to surgery with her hands.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	 The fourth reason is the fear of falling into deep sections caused by the length and width of stones.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	 If this necessity arises from such a place, it is necessary to have with you a woman who knows medicine very well: and few come across her.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	 If earlier or later you encounter a cast iron physician, subtle and present, or another woman who is proficient in the art of women giving birth: so that she may do everything that is above for him from an examination under the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	 In the beginning (or first), it is necessary that a man examine if she is a woman; then he must introduce his finger into her vagina and use a stone
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	 If it came to pass that he inserted his finger into her vagina, then let him apply the obstetric forceps, so that he can introduce his finger into a virgin's vagina and inquire about the stone after placing his left hand on the hymen and compressing her with a good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	 If it came to pass that he removed the stone from her vagina downwardly toward the lower part with all his strength, until she reached the base of her hips.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	 Then let him place her on the side with the opposing knee of his left leg next to the base of the hip, and from there he takes out the stone; so that his finger does not move off the stone and it is necessary for a division first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	 Then let him insert the ramrod into her incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	 If it is necessary to remove the stone by way of incision, then he adds the ramrod according to a quantity proportionate to that of the stone removed from her.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	 And you know that stones are many in kind.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	 From him, it is uneven and big, soft and rough, long and round, with hairs.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	 Therefore, you know the kind of stone from this very thing by which that happens to her above.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If it occurs that she loses blood at the time of intercourse, then let him apply a certain remedy and hold it for an hour until the blood stops flowing.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	 Then you will have your remedy ready for her and hold it while she is on the operating table until you remove the stone; so that when you are prepared with those instruments which I mentioned to take out the stone from a man, you can help them by using these in your own operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	 If it occurs that you lose blood and know that the removal of blood is from an artery which has been cut; then let him apply a sponge to the place and tie it with a strip of linen with good binding strength; do not remove it until you have done so: release the stone, but do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	 A woman will die in childbirth.
Deinde cura uulnus.	 After delivery of a child
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	 Then the womb will be open for you after the period when the uterus is healed and the location has been cleansed with a suitable medical procedure so that it can again be used as an operating table.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	 To remove the hernia.
Caput LXII.	 The 62nd chapter.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	 The ramekins are not full unless the quantity of moisture is balanced with cold water; this condition occurs when both the testicles and the anus are held together.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	 And when it is within the pouch itself to its own part that nature prepared for it in a way that was no good enough to be completed; this condition occurs when both testicles and anus are held together.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	 The generation of these bags is from a weak force that harms the testicles; it flows to them this material.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	 And when it happens due to a blow above the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	 This moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	 Or it could be from its stains towards the white color of the chalk, or due to redness, or from excrement, black, or from water, white, or from something else.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	 The signs that show when there is a balance between moisture are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	 If it is on the pouch white as we mentioned before, then it looks like a round circle to its length more than that figure; and you won't see testicles because moisture holds him in every part.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	 If it is due to the pouch holding moisture itself, then the sign looks round with some of its part; and this way a man can see that there's something else.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	 If it is due to the moisture between testicles and anus being white, then you'll notice it under your senses.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	 When therefore the understanding of colors with moisture comes to be, you will find a color with moisture on the sign next to the opening, whose shape precedes it.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	 I enter with a view towards what I expect from this instrument [the instrument being used for surgery].
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	 After we have entered into the hands of him who performs the surgery with iron tools, it is necessary for you to become blindfolded so that he can operate safely on your part if possible [of your body], and ensure his operation will fill up your body completely
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	 Then you must place a cover over him and many towels beneath him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	 Then sit on the left side of him and give the minister to sit on his right hand [the surgeon], who stretches out one of two fingers towards your face, and reaches for the other finger of the opposite hand
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	 Then take a narrow strip and cut through it lengthwise from the middle up to your nose, then draw [a line] according to an equal length which cuts the finger, until you reach the white part of your face; and observe him or examine him carefully while washing off any remaining [part], so that you may cut him at all points.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	 Then make a large hole in the strip for the water to come through completely and take away all of it.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	 Then divide the strip between the two lips with a finger and spread it out to its highest point; don't touch the completely washed [part of his face], because you want to cut him as much or little as possible depending on your skill.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	 If you do not sufficiently scrutinize the incision and it is not secure [or safe], then water will come through again.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	 If outside of your hands touches him during the time of surgery, when you have made an incision into his skin, then immediately cut off and reduce it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	 Then close up the two lips with stitches [of the skin].
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	 And then take care of him as you would a wound until he is healed.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	 If outside enters into your hand and is black or dirty from ashes [ashes] or other things, then you must wash it immediately with those that are wet because of the fear of blood flowing.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 "After cutting away the suspensor and suspending it, remove (the part you have detached) with care; next proceed to what we said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	 "If water is collected into two parts, then you know there are two branches; therefore, remove the other branch equally as it was detached from the other.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	 "If they are equal to you, then proceed with one operation; next remove (the part you have detached).
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	 "Take a rope and tie it under the section of the tongue in oil or in rosato; then put another loop onto the same part you submerged into wine and olive oil; after expanding it over two tongues, look at its veins: next place double folds on top, they are thin; and bind them with the sixfold knot according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	 "Two pieces are tied on each side and they tighten; the one is attached to the tongue with a sharp knife or wet wool, according to this likeness: after it reaches its extremities, either attach (the part you have detached) from the back by tying it to the bottom of the shoulder blades. The second one attaches to the breast bone: both are tied over two inferior cowls and two other ones over two inguinal regions; after that all folds will be gathered in a total knot at the base of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	 "After cutting off the suspensor with a sharp knife at the place where you want to make an incision and you have made it so that you collect the subtile cautery; you dry (the part you have detached) after cautery is applied; when it is heated, according to what we said.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	 "Let Greek letters be assimilated.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	 "After that you have attached the cautery, when it is heated until the humidity has completely gone away.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	 "After that you have spread out the cautery with your fingers and wipe it carefully off after igniting a subtile cautery; make an incision according to what is possible for you until you remove all of him.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	 "You must not touch it with fire.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	 "You know that this operation is more beneficial than one involving blood flow and better still without the need for surgery.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	 "If you encounter a section that opposes your wishes in the first hour of surgery or the heat from a cautery needle, either the flow of blood, or something else: then it is necessary for you to cure whatever brings about opposition by means of the care that was granted to him beforehand.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	 "If the patient is timid and does not anticipate this surgery because of his fear: then administer a perforation as I have mentioned.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 "When you confirm with me that the aforementioned matters have been understood and accepted by you, then it is necessary for you to support the patient's head so he can lie down.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	 "Then perforate an aperture below his buttocks with a narrow slit on either side and place the perforation according to the length of the body, so that it is wide enough for water to pass through completely.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 "Then place a ligature above the slit and tie it off, so that the water can flow through in its entirety; then care for him until his wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	 "If the opposition is encountered while you are perforating that slit and it is not removed until after because of a white patch on the incision, which prevents water from exiting; then it is necessary for you to introduce a pen or some other tool with which water can be extracted, as follows: either in addition to the operation of his wound, or an instrument similar to one used by physicians who practice hydrotherapy.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	 "You know that water is excreted after menstruation and sometimes before or after it.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	 "Therefore, you should administer as follows: care for him in the same way as before until he is healed and has had his days to recover.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	 "Of the treatment of a sore on the skin of the ram's face.
Caput LXIII.	 "Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	 The incision above this ramus is filled with dread and fear of destruction in many dispositions
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	 You should get rid of it as part of that
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	 And I am the one who remembers and repeats the operation in this manner.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	 Therefore, when many needles fall from the body to which they belong and cause them to be cut off, it happens that this is caused by multiple causes.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	 Or due to acute or severe thirst for testicles
Aut ex percussione.	 Or from a blow
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	 The pain of the aposteme is as the color of the body and it does not hurt him: he is gray and pale.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	 Or perhaps the aposteme may be a stone whose color is dark and who has no feeling for himself
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	 Sometimes it can also happen due to a blockage in the arteries and an increase in their pressure: just like what happened before with his memory, or from an increase in blood vessels.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	 Therefore it is due to the above mentioned when you compress him with your fingers you realize that it is an aposteme.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	 And do not let his touch be too strong.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	 This is what happens when it occurs from an increase in blood vessels but does not spread anything with your fingers when you compress him.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	 And it is possible that a section above this type can be made and above the rest of the muscles, in order to cut off the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	 Then extend your hand upwards and remove him from the rope with a white handkerchief, release the arms, tie up the hands again, and cut off the ropes when you have freed him from all sides.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	 If his hand has been bound with newly-cut flesh then it is necessary that you grab hold of him and cut off his hand.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	 And if there is a separation between something from the sheath or inside of his hands then you should free all that and cut her off with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	 If an injury has occurred on a part of the body where the birth of flesh is situated behind, then you should remove all of it and take out the skin in the same manner as we mentioned before.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 After your operation has been completed then cover the wound with a bandage soaked in oil and honey; thereafter take care of him as prescribed before he is cured.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	 With regard to treatment for baldness caused by vitriol (nitric acid).
Caput LXIIII.	 Head size 64.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	 The eye is moved out through a small opening with the help of a similar instrument as that used for the nose; it causes great difficulty in movement and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And in its treatment there is fear because of what preceded this remedy in remembrance.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	 Indeed it should be done as they mentioned the operation previously.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 Therefore I say that it is necessary to keep the patient lying on an elevated bed.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	 And then pull down the support of the nose towards the lower part.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	 And then hold on to the support of the nose with your fingers and its moisture that is near; keep it there and let another person stretch it out by a gentle movement.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	 And then make a straight cut across the narrow part of the nose with an acute pointed instrument; until it is detached from both sides.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 After that remove all parts as we mentioned for removing veins previously.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	 After this fasten the double rope around them where it occurs; and then fasten it again at the last of these places.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	 After this remove all that is added from corruption by moisture with a straight cut according to the length of the body and take out what has been added; so you will have cured him completely without any part remaining.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	 After the care of the wounds and the wounds of the veins with which you have to heal, let those that nourish one of the nostrils be cut off; so they will go down in order to bring about death.
Non est enim malum per illud.	 It is not evil because of this.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	 If the wine has spoiled all of its juices, then it is necessary to extract them from the testicle with the veins: that no nourishment may come from this, because of the incision, and so it may excrete or be eliminated, but not leave any residue in them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	 Of the cure for rectal sores.
Caput LXV.	 Head 65
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	 The excrement of the rectum is extracted from the incision which has caused it to ooze through the anus and into the perineal area as if it were urine
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	 Therefore, they descend down the intestines due to that rupture at one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	 And this rupture may be from the anus itself or the extension of its wall.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	 And these two species may occur due to many causes: either from the blow (blow or impact), or from a sudden movement of its wall, or from a loud noise, or from the violent death of another cause, and similarly.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	 And the mark when it is from the extension of the anus.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	 It happens sometimes with time that it is long and does not happen immediately; therefore because the anus was compressed by the testicle.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	 The mark of it when is from the section of the anus because it makes immediate pain at its origin; and it differs in appearance beneath the skin, and that way it goes out through the intestines and its course to the outside of the anus.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	 It may happen with an intestine hernia; and it is called this of the intestines, and the hernia; and sometimes it does so with effusion.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	 It may happen that it flows through the intestine of a lump, and held there; and it is with it because of the injury to be very painful, and especially when pressed down upon it.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	 And in the collection of the causes for fear of this with iron is necessary that it happen to the occasion within her.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	 And the mode of operation is, so as to remove quickly and reduce the intestine in his hand towards the inside of its own cavity if it was reduced.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	 In your hand place them [the eyes]; and with your fingers touch them
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	 After this, you should extend the eyelid towards the upper one, and then dry it completely in length from the roots of the eyelashes.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	 After that, you should make two incisions on both sides of the nose with a small knife to open it up; and then cut the eyelid in half by its quantity so that it can be opened completely from within.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	 After that, you should cut open the eyelid and what is below it; until the white part of the eyelid has been opened completely from all sides; then insert your finger-tip into where the eye follows, into where it is between the two eyelids, and absolutely with it towards the posterior part.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	 After that, you should move the eyelid with your right hand towards the inner cut of it; and with this you should extend the white part upwards, with your left hand: and touch the whole eye with both hands together so as to stretch it out completely; and you will find complete solution for the problem.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	 And ask your fingers not to be inserted into the slit of the eyelid because that could cause damage inside it.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	 If anything comes out from there, then pull it towards the lower part.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	 After that, you should take the thread which is attached to it from ten stitches; and put this in front of the upper eyelid slit, i.e., the one covering the eyelashes section; then cut both ends where they come out from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	 After that, you should bind some of them with others in a figure like the cross; and tie these to the eyelid where we have described it, because this is the ligament of the eyelashes beneath the upper eyelid, so that nothing can be inserted into their veins through there towards those parts which feed on them, or else they would cause pain.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	 "And then place a second ligature beyond the first one, extending it with two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	 "After that, remove the two ligatures from between the fingers, placing one beneath each nail of the thumb and little finger; then strike off with both hands the remaining one according to its roundness.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	 "Then dry the lower part of the thumb and little finger, from which a flow of blood arises; as we did when it was first released.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	 "Then apply a band soaked in oil and tie the ligature that has been released.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	 "And when we have burned the ligature as mentioned before, fearing a flow of blood from it after its removal.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 "But this often happened many times.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	 "And remove the ligature until it falls by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	 "If this happens after a long time has passed and its removal is difficult due to the swelling of the blood vessels; then apply it with warm water and place over it that which we mentioned before until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	 "After curing the wound with the remaining treatment for wounds, until healing occurs.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	 "From a skilled barber.
Caput LXVI.	 "Chapter 66: The Treatment of Burns
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	 "In this chapter I did not see anyone who had been burned while receiving treatment with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	 "And some said that it should be treated similarly to how we treat the wound on a barber's chair when wet with vinegar.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 "This is that when placed above the burn after it has been cut and dried in the middle; then apply a bandage as we mentioned before with vinegar, so that they do not fall out of place; finally cure the wound as mentioned before until healing occurs.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	 "Of the injury which happens to the buttocks.
Caput LXVII.	 "Chapter 67: The Treatment of Injuries
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	 "When an injury occurs to the buttocks as mentioned before; it remains there and does not descend on the fingers anything from within the intestines; if it descends, only then is that a small wound with a bandage put back into all four corners: when time passes while using this treatment for a long time, it adds a cut in the ligature until intestines drop out of it.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	 That happened through a wound caused by the sword as we have stated before
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	 Which is because of the length of the sword; then it becomes soft and the place where it entered heals over time
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	 And his care was with caution as we have mentioned before.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	 And sometimes he cared for him with a knife, in the same way; and it is that the sick one lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	 Then the dried place where the opening of the wound was located and its extension through a length equal to three fingers on either side
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	 Then stretch them tight as the sword is held in place until it reaches its tip, which is below where you hold it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	 Then take a handle and lay him on the elevated place from the sword; then press down to the depth of his chest.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	 Then hold them tight above the farthest part of your hands from the sword; and tie both together with a stitch one to another; then remove the farthest part of your hands
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	 And do not break all of them completely or stretch them, nor anything else like that, as I taught you to know in the course of the intestinal fistulas.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	 Then his care is with ulcers.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	 When you reach that point, open it up, and restore the ulcer until it has healed over.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	 His blade will bend backwards, but not to be added to the elevation of the opening.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	 The cautery is better here because it is close to healing.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	 Concerning the softening of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	 Chapter sixty-eight
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	 The skin of the testicles becomes softer on some people because the muscles that are between them become soft and the appearance of the one is affected by this.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	 Therefore it is necessary for him who asks about the care of them to press down on his back a sick one and cut all of the softened skin above the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	 After making an incision on both lips and stitching them together, if you wish, apply some softened skin with a couple of stitches or four, and firmly sew that too.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	 Cut between the stitched parts.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	 After taking care of all the wounds and stitching them up securely, then let it fall off naturally.
¶ De Castratione.	 About castration.
Caput LXIX.	 Head 69
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	 Indeed, since castration has been cast out from our law (i.e., the canon law of medicine), and for that reason it was permitted to me so as not to remember him in my book like this; and there is no need to remember him unless by two ways.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	 The only way that it should be remembered when a doctor is being questioned about this; and so he knows the cure for what happened to him.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	 And the other way is that we are often practiced on castration among animals, for our own sake; as in sheep, goats, and others of that kind.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	 Therefore I say it should be done according to two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	 Or by gradual attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	 Or by a cut and removal.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	 The way it is done by gradual attrition and a cut-and-remove operation is as follows: we would make the animal to sit in warm water until its testicles are softened up, then they let them stay down while remaining limp, and at that point you take hold of them with your own hand until they stop moving and don't show through touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	 For the castration by cutting and removal, you must hold tight the animal, and press down on his testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	 After ligging the suspensors and drying all over them with one section, until when both sides have been done: then you make an incision on where the cut was made after it has been dried off from above as well as below that part which is under the tail.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	 And this way of castration is better than one by gradual attrition because the gradual attrition sometimes causes loss in testicles and that is why it was desired to not cut them off.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, ulcers should be cured.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	 Concerning the cure of hemorrhoids in two modes
Caput LXX.	 The 70th mode (of treatment).
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	 Hemorrhoids are cured from urine through two methods.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	 The cure is brought about by the urine passing through either a slit between them or through the grip of their base, which lies between two of them, resembling the vulva of a woman and having hairs; and sometimes it flows from that part where it enters the cleft behind one of them.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	 In women there is another mode of cure; and it resembles the vulva of a woman above the fold in such a way that they resemble the upper urethra to one side only, and two on both sides just like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	 The cure of three kinds (by urine) and two by women is as follows: for it must be that the added flesh is cut off until the impression has gone away.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	 Therefore, ulcers should be cured with the help of the remaining parts (of treatment).
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	 In the second mode for men is urine taken from behind one of them that lies between two of them, which does not operate and has no cure at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	 Concerning the cutting off of the foreskin and elevating the flesh on it among women.
Caput LXXI.	 The 71st mode (of treatment).
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	 By this means the foreskin is added above nature until it becomes tender and looks like a swollen part of it; but sometimes among certain women it magnifies itself so much that it becomes as large as one would find it among men, when it has extended as far as the foreskin.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 It is therefore necessary to hold the excess of foreskin with one's hand or a knife and cut off; but not at last in cutting it as far down as its root, especially in its deepest part so that no blood flows.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore the ulcers should be cured with their help.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	 The foreskin is the one born in a mother's womb until it reaches out; and sometimes its removal will be for the sake of resemblance with tails, some people call this the tail-like grip.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	 "Therefore let us make an incision like that of a fistula and heal it as we would a wound.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	 The female urethra is not perforated by the stone.
Caput LXXII.	 Chapter Seventy Two
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	 Albucasis' term for the urethra or bladder stone.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 It is either physiological (normal) or accidental (unexpected).
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	 It is accidental when it precedes by the slip of the foot or hand; and may be added from the flesh, or from subtle poison, or from spit (spit being an old term for an emetic); and may happen in the profound matrix [of the uterus], or in the side thereof, or above or below, or at menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	 The knowledge of its cause is obtained through an inspection of the birth marks (obstetrical examination).
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	 If it is not visible then seek its cause with your finger or by using a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	 If the inspection reveals the presence of two lips (labial ulcers) then this may be the cause; and to remove it is necessary to separate both the ulcerated parts.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	 And if you find two ulcers on either side:
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	 Then put both your fingers together and place the woman's hand upon her back with your arms extended.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	 Then extend the two lips strongly until you see through inspection what caused it.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	 Then take hold of the hand and drink its contents; then place this upon a spot: and for as long as it remains unfastened, let the woman copulate every day until no other spot is left unfilled.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	 If the ulcer is large and deep then you must separate it from a similar piece of cloth with a small hole for spitting out any poison or phlegm.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	 If the cause is from a flesh wound then bind it up with cotton and make an incision: use as medicine for stopping bleeding without causing injury to the flesh like acacia or dragon's blood, and so applied together with alum.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 In the meantime use a large clamp to hold the nose in place and let it stay like that for days until such time as you have applied the ointment made from linseed. And then apply the linseed ointment after that, if necessary, to cure any remaining inflammation with care
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	 Or when one of the nostrils is blocked by a growth or something similar to it, you should use scissors and cut along this way until there's no longer any cancerous tissue remaining; otherwise do not allow iron against cancer.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	 For hemorrhoids and bothor rubs on the vulva of women.
Caput LXXIII.	 The thirtieth head.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	 Hemorrhoids are the opening of veins in anus, until it runs out of blood and sweat profusely.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	 When then the hemorrhoids are treated, they become thin; and I have already described their signs and symptoms in my last passage, and what is done to them for treatment, and what is not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	 I therefore declare that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb are not visible to the senses; then there is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	 Those which fall into the womb through the vagina and onto which falls the sense are those which are treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	 Therefore it is appropriate that a woman enter her house cold.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	 After this, Athethel cuts them off with scissors or strips them off using a cloth, and slices from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	 Afterwards he washes them off near the blood flow of one incision and without any cutting or mutilation; like acacia trees, dragon's blood, and similarly with other things
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	 Afterwards he moves his feet to the wall for a short time.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	 After that, he lays her down into cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	 If the blood flow remains interrupted; then you should let her rest in a mixture of chamomile and roots, and walnut, and garlic, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	 After that you should take the ointment made from barley flour, and wrap her up with honey and vinegar, and put a bandage over it on top of his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	 If blood is severed from it, that's good; if not, make an incision in the back of the hand and milk the breasts without scarring
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	 Then take the rope and immerse it in heated oil; then apply it to the tip of your nose or to the tongue, as desired.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 When this has quieted down, anoint the spot with ointment and wait until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	 The wound on his hand resembles that of a leopard; its appearance is terrible.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore let you strike what is visible from him according to what I said earlier; and care for him until he is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	 The wound resulting from the opening of the matrix
Caput LXXIIII.	 This was done by an expert with 72 surgeries on his head
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	 Many species of leeches have been applied to the matrix as one would apply cancer, and wounds, ulcers, abscesses, boils, hemorrhoids, and fistulas; in short, all kinds of sores and excrescences
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	 I have already said all about the leeches and their signs and cures; it is necessary for me to mention here what kind of wound was inflicted on his hand when he had applied leeches which cling together, so as you can understand how this opening occurred with a knife.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore let you ponder.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	 Then if the pain of leeches in his seizure is acute with a blow and fire and fever; you can see him red because it falls on him; when the sense goes over, do not approach with the wound itself; and care for him while he suffers from above maturation until the heat of accidents has subsided.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	 Then let you put the woman down on the bench where she reclines two benches and leans back or rests her head; let her feet be gathered together above their lower part towards the inside of the thighs: and let her hips expand, and have her arms below her shoulders bound with cords that are well fitted to each other.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	 In that sitting position she holds an instrument which opens up the holes of the womb
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	 Whose shape fits into these
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	 And when she has mastered using this instrument, then it is necessary to proceed with the vaginal examination as carefully as possible so that nothing more serious than a slight injury occurs from the instrument itself, and the examiner suffers no harm.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	 If the instrument is more than necessary for the procedure, then it should be covered with a gauze over the deep part of the womb to prevent any deeper penetration into the womb and to put on a finger or something similar (to detect leakage) at the top side to keep the instrument still and allow it to move in order to uncover the womb.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	 When this is completed and touched by hand, it should be gently removed from its own head with a soft and smooth material placed over the top side.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	 When the vagina is rinsed out and dried with a soft and smooth material placed over the top side of it, then you need to lubricate (insert penis) completely underwater using a slippery oil or similar substance and hold it firmly while inserting into the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	 And you must place something on top of both the vagina and the clitoris to lubricate them with water which is already wet from previous use.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then it was cured after two days when she had been oiled in order that it might be prepared.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	 And when the womb and vagina have been rinsed out with water mixed with a lubricant or similar substance, then it is rubbed with the root of silphium (a plant) until they are moist and ready for oiling.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	 If the vagina has been hidden between the folds of the womb then it should be extracted from her with forceps as described previously and gently removed from there.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	 The art of childbirth is practiced on pregnant women in such a way that the exit of the fetus does not follow its natural course (way).
Caput Lxxu.	 The head of one hundred
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	 It is necessary for an obstetrician to first recognize the normal form of a birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	 When you see a woman bent downwards towards her inferior side, and desiring to take in the air, and is relieved by something over her which was above the birth and festinates with the death of the embryo - then you know that this birth corresponds to its normal shape, and the exit occurs from it's head, while being supported or suspended at the belly.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	 Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary for her to be restrained so that she descends with the embryo quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	 When he descended over his head, descending in turn with him and breathing in a good way from those things which are necessary for life.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	 He who is beyond this birth is unnatural, praised be the Lord.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	 Sometimes the fetus descends over his own feet before descending its body to it's head, and then his feet and hand one at a time, or he may descend with both hands - but in any case the embryo is transferred upwards above his back supported by images worthy of praise.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	 It is necessary therefore for the obstetrician to be careful and subtle about all these things, and cure himself from error and death: And I am showing you every figure out of them, and how it is an embodiment of wisdom in that one, and it is set upon itself.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	 When the fetus descends naturally with it's exit from above over her head, and very difficult birth occurs for her - then support her on her back, or women should hold onto her: And pour water upon him to ease his pain, mixed with oil of figs, and with olive oil.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	 The obstetrician then inserted into her fingers a spongy thing, and finds it with him second time, and she holds it with his finger until the embryo descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	 If it does not come down, then it is necessary that a woman be castrated with an instrument of bronze, while applying honey.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	 After she has been castrated, then apply a compress to her after the castration with this formula and hold her mouth and nose closed for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	 The fetus will be delivered immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	 If two hands are needed to deliver the fetus initially, it is necessary that you reduce them as quickly and easily as possible.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	 If the fetus does not descend at the time of delivery, then place a woman on her back and lift up her feet to the ground. After that, put the hips above the ground with both hands supporting it so that she doesn't fall during labor pains.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	 Therefore if the hands are not delivered and the fetus dies, then make an incision in them and remove the remaining fetus. After that, tie up his hand with a bandage and remove him while being equal to each other so that he will be delivered.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	 The death of the fetus is from below downward.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	 When the fetus descends over its feet, it is necessary that you push them upwards. After that, turn the fetus quickly. After that, make him equal to each other.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	 Then one of his legs will be caught and extended easily.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	 When they have descended to the hips, then apply a compress and fix her into position for delivery with this formula. The fetus will be delivered if God wills it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	 If the head does not descend with him that we have held onto, then reduce the fetus quickly and hold it while it is in its original position.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	 Therefore he will be delivered from below downward easily.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	 If the whole head is held onto with that which we have grasped, then take out of its hold the forehead and apply honey mixed with salt, and put on it a bandage soaked in good oil so as to cut open from below downward into the mortarium with a sharp instrument during labor pains. After that tie him down firmly to her body while his head is lowered downwards inside hers.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	 "Then let her be placed in hot water until she is cooked.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	 "Having heated her to the point that her bottom was on fire, then put a silphium poultice on it and keep it there.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 "When you hold tight with one hand for an hour, then place her over the fire.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	 "Then let him be tightened by compressing his face and nose; and press downward on the lower part of his throat to make breathing difficult.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	 "His head will quickly swell up as a result.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	 "The fetus falls from the womb and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	 "When you enter by gently placing your hand gradually inside.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	 "Then the woman is positioned above her own hips and pend down with both of her feet towards below; she herself lies on her back and puts pressure on it by placing your hand there.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	 "Then press downward upon his throat gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	 "Then remove what is beneath her feet from the buttocks and let it be exposed at the bottom until it is prepared to be put on display.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	 "If not, then take both of his feet and drag them quickly away from him.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	 "Then press downward upon what is above the buttocks gradually until the fetus ascends towards the top.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	 "Then put your hand inside gently and adjust him gradually until you get the fetus to descend.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	 "The fetus then hangs downward from his hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	 "You pull on him with a gentle touch, and you will eventually remove him
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	 "If not, then drag the woman along by pulling her forward.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	 "Then place her on top of his head and press down with your feet to put pressure on him.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	 "Then administer the poultice you prepared from the mucilage.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 "If he pulls her away during childbirth, then place her over the fire.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	 "In order to study the reduction of the hand and its proper position for both genders, first hold it level as it would normally be in a living body; then teach a woman how to contract or close her fist.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	 "The fetus descends from its own column and stretches out of the way with its hands; after that it reaches back towards the mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	 "The obstetrician holds the fetus by the hand and gently moves it around quickly while keeping it in balance.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	 "Once you are balanced [in position], then hold its head with your right hand and gently pull out any remaining umbilical cord and afterbirth.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	 "Then teach her to move it slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	 "Once you have done that, then place her on the bed and teach her how to turn her face towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	 "Then teach her how to contract as shown in position [i.e., hold it level].
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	 "The fetus descends from the right side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	 "When it has descended into the mother's vagina in this manner [i.e., with its back towards the head], then you grasp it gently with your thumb and hold on until water is expelled.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	 "If the fetus is held in position by its face and neck, then you must strike it gently on the umbilical cord to release your grip; otherwise, it may die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	 "Then gently guide it towards the vagina and teach her to squeeze tightly; for when she has done this [given birth], it will be expelled.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	 "The exit of twins or many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	 "It is known that twins are often born together and sometimes three and four [fetuses] at a time are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	 "This may be accidental or rare.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	 "There are five things that come outside of nature and do not fit into the law; they stay together however many there may be after their birth, except one separates from its brother by a sharp blow.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	 When a fetus descends like that of an individual at birth and is born naturally, easily; but when it descends from an admirable source, as if descending from a noble person
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	 If some of them are difficult to find near the birth and need help with that which we mentioned from unnatural figures, then let us care for them as if they were infants: And may it be a gentle one who does not harm him in any way, but rather helps him according to his nature while helping him quickly and carefully.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	 A reminder that what is formed from the fetus within its matrix will be aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	 Sometimes when one, or two, or three, or four, five, six, seven, ten, and more fetuses are formed within the matrix; now I have been supplied with a means by which women can abort all of them at once, along with other multiples as well.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	 That is done through the measurement of glorious wise ones.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	 Therefore, it's necessary that all knowledge about obstetrics be held by wise men (or women).
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	 And indeed they will certainly oppose him with what is fitting for them.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	 About the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	 Chapter 76
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	 When you care for a dead fetus with what I said about division from the treatment and he doesn't descend, then use surgery to move it along using your hand; at that time, pay close attention.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	 If the woman has good virtue and is not with anyone from accidents from which she fears loss; then it's necessary that she be supported by her shoulders to the front of herself so that her head may be bent downwards towards her chest, and both her hands held out in order for her body to be taken up off its own weight. And let someone hold onto her at two points or bind her to a support so that he is not dragged away from his corpse when extraction of the fetus occurs.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	 Then she will wet the vagina with warm water and oil mixed together, and gently massage it while saying prayers; then she will conceive.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	 After a midwife has taken hold of her hand with these tools and instruments, she then introduces that into the womb gently
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	 And as soon as it reaches its place where the umbilical cord is coming out of the fetus and the birth canal opens up to that location
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	 If the fetus is ready to descend and its head is about to come out, then look at it from its eyes or face or nose or throat (mouth) or palate or chin or under its beard or near its ribs or below the breastbone.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	 If the fetus descends from the feet downward, then look at it through the chest (mediastinum) of that part of its body (costum).
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	 It is necessary to hold the umbilical cord with the right hand and put it into place between the fingers of the left hand: she then introduces that into one of the locations we have mentioned before in order for her to finally reach what is being sought after.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	 After that, she pulls the umbilical cord towards herself or to one side if it is not straight but slightly curved; so that the tension remains equal and does not move away from the belly (partium).
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	 After that, the cord is gently stretched to its full length equally, and not so as to follow only a certain path towards the belly (partium), but rather until it is pulled back from all parts of its body in order for him to be born; just like when you bite or strike at the umbilical cord near its end.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	 And there where that part is between them, it should be gently stretched.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	 If a part of the umbilical cord is pulled away from that, then it should be introduced by the midwife with some fingers and tools in order for her to follow after pulling back what she has retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	 If part of the fetus comes away then they are pulled towards another place that is higher; do this until it becomes fully detached (pergrediatur foetus totus).
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	 If part of the fetus comes away and it is not possible to reduce its hand because of a constraint (coartatio) then she should let herself hang down over that hand.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	 "Having thusly freed her, when thou hast gathered her together, cut off the hand and foot separately; either at the juncture of the palm or the cubit (i.e., from the elbow); so that one shall be done with thy other hand, while in two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 "If the fetus is great (i.e., if it obstructs delivery), or an umbilical cord injury occurs, or there is a mass of water on its head; then let him introduce by way of a spike a thorny spur through his fingers and find with it the head, and extract the water from beneath it: or let them sever what is called Almisdac (i.e., the umbilical stump), whose form unites with that of the remaining instruments in the section which follows.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	 "Likewise let him cut off the fetus if its nature is great (i.e., if it has a large head); then let him extract [it] with scissors, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	 "Then take up bones with hooks.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	 "If the head is freed but its base remains behind at the furrow (i.e., if it has been freed from above but not below), then let him search for until the humidity which is on his chest is extracted.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	 "If it does not become entangled or does not reach exit (i.e., if the fetus remains free but cannot be removed), then cut off its head as far as possible.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	 "If it has gone into the womb (i.e., if its base is between your fingers), or there are some impurities on it; then let him perforate [it], until the humidity from within [it] flows out.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	 "If it is above its own feet (i.e., if the fetus hangs down), then drawing [it] becomes easy for you and directing towards its mouth are the eyes.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	 "If it becomes entangled at the furrow (i.e., if it is entangled beneath you), or on its chest; then let him extract [it] with a cloth which you have bound around your hand: and find below, until the humidity within them flows out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	 "If any of the remaining parts are left after it has returned to its head; then let the midwife introduce her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	 If the mouth is opened by force, then one hand should be inserted into the opening of the mouth and hold its head with it; after that, the other hand shall take its head as far as the fingers can reach up to the mouth; thereafter, one thumb or two thumbs shall be introduced in turn.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	 If the mouth is closed with a cold finger that has caused injury to it, then at this point one should not allow anything else to be put into its mouth; instead, one should administer a soothing liquid or solution such as water, juice, or wine: and afterwards place in their mouth something soft and moist.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	 If the fetus is above its own length, then it would be possible to equalize; at that point one should administer what we have mentioned as appropriate for the fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	 If this is not possible, then a great effort shall be made and it must be extracted forcibly.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	 It should also not be allowed anything to enter the second nostril of every single individual.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	 After you have completed your surgical procedure, one should administer what we mentioned earlier as appropriate for the cold fingers that cause injury to the mouth.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	 If bleeding occurs from the wound, then one should descend into it using tweezers and administer any remaining cure.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	 I have also heard of a woman whose fetus died within her womb; thereafter she was impregnated with another fetus and the other one later also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	 Therefore, a cold finger caused injury to its navel for an extended period of time; thereafter it was inflated until opened, and then began emitting pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	 I have spoken about the care that should be given to him; for a long time he was treated and no healing occurred in the wound.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	 After putting something very strong, like a powerful plaster or cloth over it from which pus escaped, then it exited from that location through its mouth.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	 Later on he died and the other one exited as well.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	 I am amazed at this because there is no mouth present within the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	 "I think therefore there was a dead fetus in the womb.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	 "I examined it and took away many bones from a woman who was better off than others; then she remained as long as time allowed her to remain there.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	 "But I was not able to examine this thing here because there is knowledge of it and assistance towards that which a physician administers with his hand through care.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	 "Of the necessary instruments for taking out a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	 "Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	 "Here is the form of the hook, which makes them equal; having two equal wounds on both ends of two logs.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	 "However, this hook should be more slender than the hooks for the bones; and it can either be made of bone or from the log.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	 "The width of all the logs should be like two fingers; and the edge on both sides is almost as a finger, and the length on each side are palms and half-lengths; in the middle there are two indentations out of that kind of wood which have been set into these ones whose length is half the palm plus less. And the width of both should be like two fingers or more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	 "These two indentations are inserted into the mouth so that they can be opened with them when you need to come out of them.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	 "The shape of the hook used for extraction is described below:...
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	 "...another shape like it but thinner and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	 "...it should be made of bone or from the log, according to its similarity to the hooks.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	 "However, there are two indentations on it like those here above; and the length of all of them is as half palm.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	 "When you want to extract the matrix while holding it with this, have a woman hold down her head over the board, hanging onto her feet with hers, and open what is between her legs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	 After having introduced these two instruments into one handle... and you hold the inferior end of the instrument between your thighs, near to the joint where it joins with the thighbone
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	 After you have taken hold of the instrument like you would take hold of fingers... until the obstetrician instructs you to do so
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	 The other form is different from what was previously described, it's called the "form of the impelling force" that guides the fetus
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	 The form where you hold a large head... and with your fingers you grasp it as if they were teeth at the end of your fingers
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	 And when a nosebleed occurs... you grasp it like this with the fingers of that form, as if they were teeth, similar to how you hold things with your fingernails
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	 The form where you hold a small head...
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	 You have one spine in the grip of these hands.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	 You have two spines in the grip of these hands.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	 The form where you hold a fetus by its head...
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	 You have two handles for grasping the neck.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	 The form of these two small handles is also long.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	 All of these instruments are used... and the number of their kinds increases... and they are put into use by craftsmen, either for performing an action or as a tool to assist them in their work... because of their size, one is useful for surgical operations and one is useful for people,
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	 Therefore you should not throw these instruments away, but put them aside.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	 It is therefore necessary to keep them.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	 Of the extraction of the second
Caput LXXVIII.	 Chapter LXXXV of the extraction of the head.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	 When the Second is held at childbirth... then it should be as weak as possible so that it can hold on to its own desire.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	 Then make the same action as before... and put your hand over his mouth and his nose.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	 "Therefore I consider it beneficial.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	 "If not, then take that and cut out the bone in front of it; put herbs around its mouth as you would do for a dog when he is sick, such as calamus [turmeric], rue [wild carrot], etc., and bring them into contact with fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	 "Then take the [already mentioned] herb and put it on top of the opening of the dog's mouth; hold her until she drinks some water, then let go.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	 "After that, make her vomit as we described earlier.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	 "Secondly it is beneficial with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	 "If after this treatment you do not benefit from it, then take to the obstetrician that he may wash his hand with sesame oil or mucilage of aloe.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	 "Then approach her with it; hold on until she has taken the second herb.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	 "Having therefore approached her, take her and quickly stretch out to her.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	 "If she had been caught up in the mouth of a dog, then take her hand as we described earlier until she has taken the second herb; quickly stretch out to her so that no bone is trapped by the powerful force and it may be thrown aside.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	 "This one had been eaten then, she was saved; given back to him from the trap.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	 "If her mouth is caught up [by a bone], as we had mentioned earlier; cure with vomiting and from the treatment of dogs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	 "If you do not benefit with all that is described earlier, then be careful that you are not dragging her through the iterations of extractions.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	 "Indeed it must be so as to benefit from her mouth, lest she should go to waste because of exhaustion.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	 "Then apply the ointment Tetrapharmacum with a cloth.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	 "The flesh will rot after one day and dissolve.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	 Nevertheless, when it spoils, a foul odor arises from its remains which go to the belly and head, causing illness in her.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	 Therefore, they should use suitable fumigations for it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	 Some ancient experts know how to perform a fumigation of the sick person's bed and room.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	 A tool form for performing a fumigation on a woman during her confinement in Second House (during pregnancy) or menstruation
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	 Let the tool be of a similar form or design; and let one end be wide above the fire: and then perform the fumigation over the fruit: hold her until she has consumed that fume: repeat with another woman.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	 The treatment for Ani was not applied.
Caput LXXIX.	 Chapter 79th
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	 Many boys are born, and none of them have been treated by Sifac the subtle man.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	 Therefore it is necessary that the midwife apply Sifac's finger to this, or if not, with a sharp Spatumulus and Cautios; for fear of hurting him (the boy).
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	 After putting it on them (the boys), spread upon them a cloth infused with wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with the children until he is cured.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	 If there are things to be taken out of his way (i.e., if he is unclean), then take from him the money and let it stay until after many days when a boy has grown up enough to earn it.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	 And the treatment for Ani is also used in conjunction with the urine of the nurse or the midwife.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	 Therefore it should be ensured that the consolidation is taken care of and then he will be cured as mentioned in the treatment section and from his money.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	 The treatment for fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	 Chapter 80th
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	 Fistulas that occur in the lower part are Nodation and Grossitude which occur near anus or in one part of the space; and there is a single fistula or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	 "As soon as the (hand) grasp relaxes and flows with clear water, either from a subtle spring or thin pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	 Sometimes, there are these penetrating fistulas.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	 Therefore, those penetrating ones are recognized by that which is forced out from the discharge, and by the stench when it is used by an exhausted one with a forced discharge; and perhaps there may be one who has been forced out of them as well.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	 And those fistulas are from within when they extend deep inside the body up to the liver and also up to the flesh of the bladder.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	 And those fistulas are from within when they reach right up to the pubic bone and even the tailbone's knot.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	 Therefore from that one which is recognized as a penetrating fistula up to the finger you put inside it; and also for an unpenetrating one there's another way of putting in by means of a slender tube from the air or iron when there isn't any tortuosity.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	 If there is any tortuosity within it then I put in by means of a thin lead or a feather from the horse's tail until you are satisfied and then use your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	 If you do not feel the penetration and it proceeds from nothing other than the discharge or the stench or exhaustion then you know that this is unpenetrating; therefore take care in your treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	 And when the fistula is penetrating up to the liver or the bladder; then its meaning is from the discharge coming out of it and a prohibition upon it so that the place may be solidified with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	 If it is penetrating up to the pubic bone or the os of the penis; then its sign means that you must try to insert something into it until it reaches this point if there isn't any tortuosity until here and an invention of pain around part of it, so that pus always comes from it and a treatment without unguent won't solidify with it.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	 In all those fistulas which are penetrating there is no universal treatment and the treatment of them is hard work and sweat from those medicines by means of which it is formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	 In that which is not penetrating and is not ancient hope healing with iron; as I have shown you before, it works thusly: place the iron over his back so that he lies between your hands on his back, and move up to both of his legs until they are above his hips
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	 Afterward you will insert a tube for air or water if there is a fistula with twisting. Until then you do not know where it has been inserted.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	 If the patient feels something in his finger, at that point insert your index finger into his mouth.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	 Therefore, if you feel the finger has gone all the way through and reached the end of it that you know for certain that it is penetrating; do not work on him unless he can be healed as we have said before.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	 But they say that healing can occur with some people when flesh is used as a medication and it hopes for the disease to go away; so do this: apply a subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, as before, and then insert the heated iron into the fistula until he feels around his finger.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	 Afterward do this again or another time until you know all the flesh has been added and it is similar to the veins of the penis in shape; then proceed as before with inserting the heated iron into the fistula.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	 Afterward treat it with heated irons or another substance until all the flesh has been removed; after that treat it with ointments and consolidants.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	 If so he is healed, that is good news.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	 And if not, then do not treat him with another treatment at all.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	 And if the finger goes in further and does not reach your finger that is in his anus; then you will know it has passed through the skin or the fistula membrane; so dry off from the beginning of the fistula with a heated iron until the finger is completely removed, after which you will remove the iron as before.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	 "After filtering out these cooked meats, which are fed through tubes in the mouth so that nothing is expelled from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	 "If you spill blood while feeding through the tubes or during your operation, then it is better to hold those cooked meats with tongs and burn them by fire (charcoal), or apply an acute medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	 "Because the tongs have burned off good qualities and scorched the cooked meats as well, you should apply a remedy to stop their bleeding, get rid of the excess flesh, and remove moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	 "After that, you should apply a remedy with a mixture of vinegar or salt to the meat until pus is released and they are taken away from the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	 "After that you should apply a remedy with solidified ointments to harden the flesh and give relief from stiffness and exhaustion.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	 "When they are finished eating, then it is healed up right away, without further repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	 "If the fistula has gone through to the very bottom of your arm and is accompanied by an excess amount of body fluids, then you should insert your finger into that fistula and examine it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 "If it causes pain when you try to put your finger into that fistula or near the opening of the fistula, then there is no operation to be done there unless trust and confidence are established.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	 "This is because there are three ways to treat it: you can either cauterize the fistula itself as we have already said; or you can cut away that part until its excess flesh has been removed so that you will be able to insert a needle and take care of it from afar.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	 "And do not proceed too much with the cutting so that you do not cut off the sensitive skin on your finger and cause it to be wounded by a violent exit of feces without any desire.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 "After that, apply our remedy as we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	 "It may heal by itself, or you can stretch it until the excess flesh near your finger is removed, as we have said before; or you could try to push through with some other acute instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	 "After passing through and filtering those meats that are in the section until you can examine them with a probe.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	 "After restoring the entire intestine by cutting through it until you reach an opening on top (a stoma), and if there is a fistula that has opened up within the anus, then this will be above the sick one.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	 "And sometimes you treat the fistula in this manner, by trying to insert a probe into it. And if you manage to get inside and see that there is an opening at the lower part of the anus near the surface of the body with your finger and its edge, then take hold of the perforated end as a needle would - namely, the point where these fingers meet.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	 "And you insert into it five threads around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	 "After trying to enter the fistula with a thread until there is pressure against its interior.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 "If then there is penetration into the anus from within close to its margin, then you take out the thread through that opening and put your finger in it and remove the end of the thread and tie both ends together tightly: and after tying them tightly, let them fall away two by two, until they have fallen off. And if more than one thread penetrates into the flesh, then tie them well, until those parts which are between the two threads fall off - at that point you treat the fistula until it is consolidated and healed.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	 "If there isn't penetration into the fistula opening, then you make sure that it penetrates deeply as much as possible.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	 "There is no one else to whom this can be done but you, so do not touch anything with it except the fistula itself.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	 "After doing as we said until it is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	 "The shape of the fistula that is being sought for a probe, whose severity was acute on one part and mild on another - so that you do not touch what is not necessary to touch as per your instructions.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	 "About hemorrhoids, whose treatment consists of cutting them off from the flow of blood from their incision: and about hemorrhoidal cure.
Caput LXXXI.	 The thirty-first head
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	 Are two hemorrhoids.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	 They are either internal or external, like those of the anus, or they may be granulations in urine
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	 And among them are small ones and large ones; and blood always flows from them constantly, and it is one, and there are many of them.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	 They are outside the anus, on its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	 However, those that are outside the anus are very few in number and of wetness; from which blood flows constantly or just a little bit, depending on how red their skin is.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	 The care of his that is inside the anus consists in holding back as forcefully as possible so he does not excrete until he gets to the outside; and when he has reached it they will be visible for you
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	 Therefore, therefore hold with nails or hold them by your finger.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	 After that, strike them near their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	 If not held by nails, because of their wetness and softening; then fold them with a cloth or hold them up with the edge of your nail or remove them using your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	 After that strike them off and clean some hot coals over them after the cut so they will stick to their place in the fire.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	 Or burn them according to what was said in the chapter on cautery
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 After that, care for them with the remaining care until they are done.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	 If not held by nails or the finger, then you must apply a small clamp to where the cutting is most severe so that he may hold onto it until he has excreted himself, or when he has expressed himself.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	 If the hemorrhoids are outside of the anus, it is easy; and it is that you hold them with your finger or nails, and strike them off.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	 After that, care for them as was said.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	 "And he who is averse to cutting with iron must have his sutures administered in this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	 "Take the thread tied and knot it tightly around that point.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	 "Then withdraw the thread from beneath and insert it into the other point; so that he penetrates with a sharp needle on one side, and goes along both sides tightly to form a knot below; leave two ends of the thread in the lower part, one above and one below; tie them firmly.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	 "Then remove the thread from around that point.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	 "With all of it tie a knot tightly; then take away one end so that he may run along the excess of blood.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	 "Then put a bandage soaked in honey or olive oil on his head; and put it over the wound so that he may rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	 "Then remove it so that he rests.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 "When the knots come undone with ointments and care until they recover.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	 "Of the cure of wounds.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	 "Indeed many happen from excessive heat and constraint in nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	 "So when the constriction happens and he is unable to reach the doctor's needle or the finger: then let him apply the salve of Spatumilis, or use his own finger until they become wet; and let them be wiped away with an upper cortex that prevents their adhesion.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	 "Then cure them as needed until they are healed according to what is prescribed.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	 "If they do not become healed as before, then repeat the treatment with more reason and more frequent care until their blood runs out; and let them be cured again after being washed, so that they will recover.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	 "Of the care of wounds on others, but not to themselves; and the application of sutures, and of ants.
Caput LXXXII.	 "The 82nd chapter.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	 "Know that the wound of an ant is a round knot according to its color and similar to the head of a fly; it reaches throughout the body, especially on the lower parts of the feet and fingers, causing pain when walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	 "Therefore let it be cut off which is on the outside of your hand or foot and held with hooks, or with a knife, so that its root may be removed.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	 "Then attend to it (i.e., the cut off part) and cauterize it according to what precedes in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	 "Another member of this group is the thumb which is erect above the surface of the body (i.e., pointing upwards).
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	 "Many accidents occur on the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	 "His care is that you stretch it out (i.e., the thumb) and cut it off either by tying a thread around it or with a nail until death.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	 "And if you are, cauterize it according to what precedes with fire or an acute medicine; and the thumb will be eradicated when it rises up and not by any instrument I say.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	 "The ant is also another member of this group which is erect above the surface of the body and extends into the depth; when it comes down with cold, a similar bite from an ant occurs on its body, causing death to all parts of the body, and many more happen in hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	 "His care is to tie a thread around the leg of an egg chicken or that of a strong ant; and put it above the ant until its circle is complete from his parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	 "Then return your hand with the thread until you cut off what is on the outside of the ant; and put it into deep flesh and remove the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	 "And if you are to do this with an air thread or a hook according to that form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	 "Place the superior part of the thread above the head so it is extended beyond the grasp of his hand and its resolution.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	 "And if you are, cauterize the ant according to what precedes in the chapter of cautery for the thumb.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	 "Of instruments which are used against a boil and the remedies given to the throat and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	 Chapter Eighty-Three
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	 When the needle is extracted from the bone, or the ear, or the sinew, or the tendon
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	 And when it is taken out by these instruments, large and small, as they are used to administer them.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	 This therefore, which is administered for the care of small boys' hairs, shall be a small one; and as their age is weak or suffering from pain, so also will that hair be small.
Clistere magnum.	 The big needle.
Cistere paruum.	 The great hair.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	 The superior part of the head to which a needle is tied with thread shall be large according to this manner; and there shall be a distinction as to tie it on one side like that done by the hand, and on the other side similarly but shorter because of its extremity, weak, mute, lax, stretched out towards subtlety, and in one side thereof are two foramina, and on the other side an opening through which the thread can pass easily.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	 The opening of foramina shall be according to the size of vessels and larger ones but shorter; and they should contain medicine from animals' veins or from papers shaped like the palm; in which there is one root.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	 The foramina shall be opened with great force and the space between all foramina according to the size of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	 Afterwards they should be tied with strong string from raw silk which is made of ten strands or around it and joined to the extreme end similarly to this manner.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	 When therefore a needle is tied into its head with thread between two distinct portions with strong compression.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	 Afterwards the needle was bound or fastened up with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	 This is a depiction of two circles drawn here and the foramina.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	 The quality of binding with the needle is as follows: to keep one extreme tight or with a hot medicine which has been heated according to the amount of tolerance, so that it may not be too warm but only slightly so; also if it were cold, then too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	 "Then the patient lies on his back and withdraws the limbs upwards; and raises them above himself.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	 "Then he holds the extremity with a towel, or a blanket, or a sheet, or anything else.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	 "Then he introduces himself into his anus gently.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	 "He then receives a minister with both of his hands simultaneously, and expresses it gently as he empties himself completely from the towel into his bowel.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	 "Then he withdraws the towel and raises the limbs above him.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	 "If medicine intends to lead him towards his exit, then let it hold as much as it can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 "And if he has slept with her for a whole night, then the remaining is further away from his expulsion.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	 "If however he has been put into a cloth soaked with the juices of his body and is to be led towards his exit; then another towel must be used until he is restored.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	 "If there are hemorrhoids or anal fissures, then the towel must be smooth and soft; so that boys can use it.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	 "And this is how towels should look like in order to be used for delicate skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	 "Of the care of the head wounds without fracturing bones.
Caput LXXXIIII.	 "The 84th chapter.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	 "Having said that about the care of wounds, I am going to say this concerning their care with a hand and by medicines according to its complement.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	 "I am therefore going to say that wounds will be diverse depending on where they happen and the location above which a wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	 "Therefore those wounds that are numerous, act in the same way as a sharp stone acts; or cutting off flesh with its edge; or striking it with an arrow; or striking with a stick; or splitting through it by means of a shuttle.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	 The ulcers which are formed in certain parts of the body behave similarly to those that fall on the head or neck, chest or belly button, heart or armpit, and similar places from these members
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	 And I am reporting cures for some ulcers so that they may be reasoned about and regulated over the remaining ulcers.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	 And I begin with simple ulcers on the head, because the recollection of the writers had not begun at the beginning of Chapter III.
Dico ergo.	 Therefore,
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	 When the simple ulcer on the head occurs and no fracture of the bone happens: then it is necessary to consider whether this ulcer came from an impact with stones or similar things; it has become big, and it is also above the sick person's elbow; here, immediately apply phlebotomy with warm water. And do not delay that because he may have just come out a little blood after coming from the ulcer: if this were prohibited by phlebotomy, especially if there was only a little blood flowing in due to the ulcer itself.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	 And let the phlebotomy be taken on the opposite side of the ulcer.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	 Let him drink wine and food that are suitable for his condition,
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	 If any prohibition on reducing weight is in effect then let them eat again from the food and not approach meat nor wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	 And if the ulcer above occurs with a warm finger or an armful of oil, or when there is wine that has stiffness in it,
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	 If you are secure from the finger or armful of oil and there is no obstruction in him, then place above the ulcer if it has blood with itself and did not let air escape because I will tell about another method after a short time: and if there was an obstruction in his air, then put on top of him some unguents so that he may be healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	 If the ulcer is big or came from an impact and similar things have happened to him: then do not let his lips go up through the nose holes; instead attach him with sutures as I will tell you about stitches for ulcers of that sort in another time.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	 If the wound has already been detected by bone and is hanging down without retention of its grip, unless it falls into a support. Then cut it off
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	 Afterwards care for the wound with medicines, and restore it to its original place on the skin; bind it firmly so that it does not loosen, as if held by a strong fist, bread cooked like a head, and millet cooked, until it stops pulsating: and they are similar in this regard.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	 If there is decay of the flesh within it, and does not adhere to bone, then cut off all the putrid matter, and throw away the remains; thereafter care for that one.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	 If there is an artery within it or a vein from which blood flows out; and does not fall off with medicines, then investigate above the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	 If so, then dry it using a sponge or bind it tightly.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If necessity arises when we did not give that which was said earlier, then cauterize it until the blood is removed.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	 If these wounds are simple and small, then the treatment for them is easy; wash over it until pus has been removed from above that one which has become consolidated before it can be moved.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	 Mode of performing a bloodletting on a child
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	 Take one part of the liver and two parts of the blood from a dragon; do not use any calcified parts as these are three in number: mix everything thoroughly and strain it well. The resulting mixture is to be applied directly on the wound, and bind tightly with good cord until it adheres firmly upon that one. Then coagulate it with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	 After this tie it down well with a bandage and remove it gently so that nothing remains sticking to the wound; in such a way as not to be left behind.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	 The medicine does not remove it immediately, until healing occurs.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	 And when it is done by itself alone, or if you are not present with liver and dragon's blood at the same time; then do this same operation in many great wounds, when they have been placed above and tied tightly, as recently mentioned before.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	 When something has been altered in the air for a certain time period especially when the air temperature is high then it's not on the mind of this person to perform their intention: Therefore, you should place some unguents (ointments) above or below the affected area depending on which one I mentioned. You can either put them on top of the affected skin with some cream made from flour and water until they release pus
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 After removing the unguents, wait for healing to occur
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	 If you encounter a broken tooth, first remove it gently using your hands and then tell me to show the cure for fractures of the head that is coming up next.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	 The Pillars
Caput LXXXV.	 Chapter 85 of the Pillars.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	 If a person encounters a lump on their neck then there is no difference between it and any medication, but when the lump on the head is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	 If a person has already been given medicine for a lump on their neck or an artery then if the lump on their head is simple there's no difference except that you should apply treatment as described above until pus releases from it just like before and tell them similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	 Because the veins hurt and they are against each other.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	 Do not put anything cold on the lump at all, because the substance of veins is cold and its continuation with the brain which is superior to other parts of the body, it's that way how treatment occurs from gentle medicines just as a stone lota mixed with sweet water many times soaked in olive oil or roasted or ointment when released even with sweet water. And the remaining minerals according to this method and moist unguents.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	 If a lump is large then apply sutures, or else use a cloth soaked with their own saliva if it's not available to bind up the wound.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 After removing the unguents wait for healing to occur
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	 If a person encounters deep swelling or the lump occurred and went into their lower part causing pus to accumulate then you should pierce it in more depressed place inside of them.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	 If the incision has already been made into an artery and blood flow to it has been obtained, then it should be separated or dried off (depending on whether one wants it to remain as is for further use, or if it needs to be cauterized due to a necessity) and ligate/sew that artery.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	 If an incision has been made in the larynx or trachea (and any other parts), and one is saluted by it: then gather up the lips of the skin with stitches around the laryngeal tube, do not touch it with your hands but keep its height equal to a normal figure.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	 After that, you should tie it in good stitches and release (let go of) it after several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with ointments which contain both stiffness and itching, until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	 If an ulcer has already made a mark on bone (meaning it is healed), then you should remove all of the pieces which were separated from the bones and either throw them away or what you can take off them: so that if they are not prepared, let go of this until decay occurs in the ulcer, and be removed along with his egress.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	 If an ulcer is recent (meaning it has only recently occurred), then crush it over it while crushing a certain amount of the thing which was poured on to it earlier.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	 If one sees an ulcer in the mouth and a fistula is formed (meaning there was a hole made from the ulcer), then take care of that fistula with whom whose memory it entered into its chapter/section.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	 About ulcers on the palms of the hands.
Caput LXXXVI.	 Chapter Eighty-Six.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	 If there is a penetration from a spear or dagger (meaning it has entered into the body), and you see its depth to him/it, then consider that.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	 If therefore a certain ulcer has caused the illness of someone else when you wish to know because it is mortal (meaning deadly), then you know that the ulcer is fatal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	 If not its depth is known to him and it is recent with his own blood, do not put anything on it the first time but leave it alone, nor tie/sew it up so that the blood does not stay within its depths for a long time and return back to the heart, causing death of the ill person. But if you are doing this out of necessity, then smear it with a favorable ointment and let it be in two days.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	 The flesh of the finger is not present to you at this moment, so place it into your own wound as a remedy for that which has been withdrawn from it through dampness; and make him fall asleep above the wound while he is drawing towards it what has gathered there within
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	 If the finger has been absent for three days or more, and no spasm of weakness occurred to it, nor a bad tremor from its heart, nor a constriction in the artery leading to the hand, but you remember his good dispositions; then know that the wound is a sore
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Cure him and with remedies, until he recovers.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	 If his illness is cured and opening of the fistula occurs, then you know that it has been done.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	 Cure him from this wound on its own head.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	 And if the wound is from a stab or a cut, and it is simple on the chest surface, or the back; then cure him with what precedes his injury through stitching up, if there was much bleeding; or with pulling out, if there was little.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	 If he has already made an impression on the bone and it occurred from him flowing out; then inquire about the wound to see if there are separate parts that need to be extracted.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	 If they aren't separated, then let go of them until the wound decomposes and extraction is no longer possible.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	 The judgment on the disposition of his limbs among other members to be cured and their cure is what we have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	 Of wounds from the vagina, and the issue of the intestines, and the closing up of them.
Caput LXXXVII.	 87th head
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	 Disruption that occurs from within is great or medium in size, or small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	 When it comes to the intestines, then either it is a great disruption, when it may lead to death of many; or the number of the intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	 Why this occurs, and their stitching up is harder and more difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	 "The disruption is also difficult in a different manner.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	 "Therefore it follows that if you do not approach his place promptly by the method of his entry, because he will inflate and then crush; thus entrance to him is difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	 "Consequently, the medium of disruptions is improved because if the reduction of the intestines does not cause difficulty, it follows that the dissolution into two kinds is easy.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	 "It should be noted that sutures are made according to four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	 "Commonly used sutures join to a suture of the belly and that of the ribs of the body; two different ones communicate with other limbs.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	 "However, they are more proper to a suture of belly; and I, for you once with an exposure, and a proclamation.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	 "Therefore I say because when there is a fistula, and it comes out of him something from the intestine; then it is difficult to reduce it; thus that is for one of two ways.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	 "Or because of a disturbance of the disruptions as we said; or if there was an inflation of the intestine due to air cold.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	 "Therefore when that is so; then you need to warm him up, or cool the sponge with cold water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	 "Or if you heat them [the intestines], and they get cold; or if you squeeze the sponge hard with it; until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	 "Whenever he does that in a drink where there is a bitterness, and it's better than just water alone in resolving the inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	 "Since you have already resolved the inflation; then warm up the intestines with a drink made from the boiled water and honey, or mint.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	 "This is because of his disruption when introduced in another way.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	 "But if the returned to him after this treatment, then find only the disruption with an instrument where hemorrhoids are treated.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	 The first care is better when it's prepared, than cutting; and there is no connection between what follows in need of preparation and the instrument's flaw
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	 One part of it is sharp and acute, while another one is not as such, the middle part being soft, yet opposite to it, that which resembles a sickle like this.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	 When the ulcer is enlarged and inflamed, then it is necessary to reduce it back to its natural shape within itself at its own place if this is possible; because that which is better
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	 If the rupture is broad at the lower part of the belly then it should be treated as a wound on his back and elevated with its limbs higher to its head
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	 And if there is one at the top of the belly then it should be placed on his head and elevated higher than its lower part
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	 And similarly if there is a rupture in two parts of the belly then place your attention and care always here so that the part with the ulcer should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	 And thus, you must administer to them generously and in moderation.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 And for those ulcers of small size place it according to what has been prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	 Then make it so that this one is placed in your hands as a helper who holds the whole rupture with his own hand and gathers its lips together.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	 Then remove from that one who follows sutures something then another; this is the common method of a suture.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	 And it is so that you take by measure and number according to the amount of ulcers' size.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	 Then you will dismiss the quantity of the rupture from the fingertips of a doctor; that is to say, you pull out one thread through two cuts on both sides and until it penetrates into another part; and when you have gathered together two parts with their lips then four orders are made.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	 "In a single motion with two threads tied around its circumference, where they are gathered together at both ends into one knot on the nose; so that when it is stretched, the two nostrils are closed.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	 "Then release the excess length of your fingers as well, and place a knot in each one; after that draw it with thread like you did before.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	 "Therefore do not bind the fingers together with those from above, until all of your nostrils are closed off completely.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 "The middle finger should be between the excess length and subtlety; because subtle fingers easily pierce through flesh, while thick ones are difficult to penetrate a knife, so that they may have both the necessary subtlety for grasping and strength.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	 "It is not necessary that the finger should be placed too close to both ends of the skin; so that it does not easily pierce through flesh, and opens up before the formation of its own knot, nor do they extend or become longer when sutured, so that the nostril may not be obstructed.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	 "Then cut off the end of your finger; put aside a patch from the skin all around it, so that they hold tightly to the end of the thread; and release them when you know the nostril is already closed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	 "This way of tying with two threads, as it suits the nostrils equally well.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	 "Since one thread is sufficient for tying them together or using more than one, or tying around them instead.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 "The second way is common, so that you gather the four threads together; two for the sides and two more for the middle, tying all of them to form one with thread as before, but using it equally well in subtlety and strength.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	 "Then when you have inserted the four threads through the nostril as before, remove the thread from the side where it was first attached; so that there is a knot on the upper part of the nostril; so that it is tied like tying clothes together, and place an equal amount of thread between all of them according to the size of your fingers.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	 Men know how to sew
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	 And with this sewing I sutured my own finger wound that had happened inside me, which was previously wounded when it encountered a tool and there was disruption of the wound greater than one palm. And from the intestine middle an exit occurred to both palms out through the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	 I therefore removed that finger wound from inside him after 24 hours had passed.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	 After 15 days the wound was consolidated and I treated it; he became well; and after that many years he remained sound and healthy and lived his life according to my disposition.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	 And they judged that he would not become well.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	 But it happened by a miracle that I was unable to treat the wound with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	 Because I was present at the place where no ointment could be applied and nothing from medicine came into play.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	 Therefore I washed my own finger wound twice a day with warm water and finally it became healed
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	 Two distinct types of sewing stitches mentioned in the sermon.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	 And there is one that starts with a sharp stitch and goes inward to the inner part
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	 And as the needle goes into a wound and reaches to the skin from outside inward, so too does it go through the whole body's length and breadth; and remove the end of the thread that you stopped at one side, making it penetrate to another side from within outward in the other extremity.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	 And as you make it penetrate so too does he make it to another side from within outward through that thread and remove the end of it at one side making it penetrate to another side from within outward through his own thread until it penetrates all around.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	 Then begin and also from this same side with that extremity which is opposite the first remove it from the skin as you have penetrated it already.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	 "Then cut the lower part of it [the finger], and remove its thumb-part (symphysis) to one side; after that pull out from under this thumb-part what lies on the outside of him, and make a single piece of this in one place, and similarly do with the other part also. And thus make one piece of both, until all is done according to this pattern.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	 "And the whole suture [or closure] should be done in a manner similar to how one skin-flap is sutured; that is, the thumb-part of what you have removed from under another part shall be sewn back on immediately after it has been taken out by another person.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	 "The second type of closure [or suture] is as Gale said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	 "His speech was as follows, so that one suture [or closure] should be made in the same manner as some surgeons do; namely, that all the parts are gathered together according to their nature for a convenient comparison of each part with another part: and apply the thumb-part on one extremity, having removed it from the other extremity.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	 "This is what I have said [or done].
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	 "It is allowed that you put the thumb-part of this close to your next neighbor's part on the outside and make it enter into him from the outside alone; then remove both thumb-parts.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	 "Then apply again and make it enter into him from the outside to another part alone; then remove both thumb-parts.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	 "Then again apply to each of them and make it enter from the inside to the outside into both thumb-parts [that are] on the opposite side; namely those that were removed.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 "This manner of closure is better than the common one and is a reminder of what was previously done.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	 "That is therefore Gale's speech also.
Et dixerunt quidam.	 "Others said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	 "The closure of the entrails should be done with two hooks or needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	 "One of the two vessels is to be introduced into each one with its own tube and start by introducing the needle through that tube towards another vessel at right angles, until you reach another vessel whose arteries are equally close together.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	 "And know that when the disruption occurs in the middle of one vessel, it is more difficult to suture than those of another.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	 "The judgment between a surgeon and his patient's wounds is also the judgment between other surgeons' wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	 "What is to be considered if you should consult a wound with its own blood before another does and reduce the intestine of one while the other's has not yet become infected? At that point it is appropriate to apply a poultice over the incision.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	 "If the other wound has already been infected, then apply a poultice that are present to you until they will heal and the stitches go down.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 "Then care for it as if it were the care of another's wound until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	 "If you do not have the medicine present to you immediately apply it over him promptly and let its discharge start, then change it twice a day as if I taught you until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	 "But when there are only simple wounds, do not take another course of medicine from many dispositions.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	 "If the wound communicates with principal parts of a body in an injury, then it is appropriate to apply the cold oil tempered with warm heat or hot oil around that place and under the ascalies.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	 "If it feels pain or a pus discharge from the intestines (for this often occurs), then clean that with a strong wine, black, and hot water until the opening is penetrated even to its depth.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	 "And you know that what comes out of the large intestine is easier to heal than that which comes from the small ones and it is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	 The intestine known as the jejunum does not receive healing from a wound that occurs in it by any means: and this is due to its multitude, which comes from veins, and the greatness of those who possess it, and also because of the subtlety of its body and its closeness to its own nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	 If what occurred due to the wound is a hernia, and you want to remove it - reduce it according to your measure of reduction by which you have reduced intestines equally in size.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 But if you find a space or a hernia, and it is also due to the injury - then let's make sure that you hold it with your thread above the place where there was a vein cut through from within, so that no blood flow occurs.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	 In the hernia are veins and arteries
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	 Afterwards cut the part that is beyond this ligament with two threads hanging from below - on the outside of it towards you so there will be an upward pull for him and extraction at the time of hernia, and blood letting from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	 Remember that the wound occurred in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	 When the disruption occurred in the intestine and it is great - then there are some people who can restore to him by removing the obstruction with a lance of some sort, if he has been injured on his own stomach while using an injection (lance) or if he had a fistula (fist like opening) which came out from within.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	 I therefore seek the care of him until I was not deceived by his healing - neither did I cease to make it subtle, until he was healed and the place was made stable.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	 After I saw that the place was already stable - I was afraid of something bad occurring on top of him because he had a bad fall into his own stomach: and no bad incident occurred due to this one.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	 And it remained in better health by itself, eating and drinking well, being full of energy, and taking baths, exercising as a result of its diet.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	 "Some experimental surgeons said that when a wound occurs inside the bowel, and it perforates (breaks through), then it is necessary to sew it up according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	 It is as if you were carrying large heads of garlic
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	 Then the two lips or mouths of the anus should be placed, and one garlic clove inserted into them through which their mouth is open over the two lips of the anus.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	 When this then falls upon it and it closes its mouth, pulling away from its head, it remains hence, but is not desirable.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	 Then put another garlic clove next to the first one, and do not stop doing it with that garlic after the garlic until you have placed all of them into the anus in their proper order according to the quantity of wounds in total.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	 Then pull it down, and its wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	 Those heads remaining attached to the bowel will not be eaten until the bowel is eaten, and it will be healed, but otherwise a wound or break of the membrane should not occur.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	 And it is possible to sew up the bowel also with a very fine thread: which has been withdrawn from an animal's intestine, and attach it after having introduced it into this place.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	 It is as if you were carrying the tip of this thread out of the intestine, and discard a great amount.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	 Then sew up with that very fine thread at its end which has been withdrawn from an animal's intestine
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	 Then introduce this thread into the bowel and with it sew it up.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	 Then pull down to its disruption (break)
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 And this mode of sewing with garlic and the intestine is not only according to the quantity of wounds in total, but also according to trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	 For the wound which is big and wide especially if it occurs inside a very narrow intestine: then there is no remedy except for subtlety of threadwork (fine sewing), nor its healing universally.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	 About treatment of fistulas
Caput LXXXVIII.	 Chapter Eighty-Eight
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	 It is known that every wound either of a finger when it grows old and withers or from an ulcer and becomes a hole, and does not get closed up, and emits pus always, and cannot be discarded: then the name by which it has been called universally wherever it occurs is Fistula, and we call this one Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	 The fistula is a connection formed by the truth of the incision, which is hard and white; without pain it has tenderness in the hand's fingers, because of this some call it by the name of Risati, that is the penis.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	 It can be found on certain occasions when wet, emitting pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	 And sometimes the moisture is cut off from some of these situations.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	 It can be found that there is a lot of moisture in certain occasions, and it has little; and it is large, and it is delicate (thin).
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	 And I have already mentioned this earlier when you asked about ulcers that do not heal or arise from it due to flesh, which is nothing but the cause of one new disease.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	 Of which one?
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	 I have already mentioned all these causes and signs of ulcers and their treatments with medicines; now it is necessary for you to know the care (cure) of fistulas and sinuses through hand operations.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	 Therefore, note that a fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	 These are the fistulas that extend to veins and arteries, or nerves, or bowels, or ears, or any part of the back; or to certain parts on either side of the body; or to a place where there is a joining of the two sides together: just like hands and feet.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	 Thus the fistulas arise in this manner and are difficult to heal; they do not receive care or occupation until the work is done with great difficulty and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	 "If the fistula is of such depth that it cannot be reached by these methods: then take a snare or an anchor and secure its entrance with confidence in his care, so as to draw out what lies within, either by means of the beak [of a crane] if the fistula extends downwards, or by iron instruments if it runs upwards.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	 "If there is twisting within the fistula, then snare it with a fine-tipped hook.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	 "Because of the softness of his body and the surrounding twists, he must be handled gently to prevent injury.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	 "If a fistula is full of many orifices that cannot be reached from the outside by the methods previously mentioned, then you will not be able to indicate what lies within it.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	 "Therefore, secure its opening with his own orifices.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	 "The moisture that enters the snare will enter through another of his openings as well and run out from there.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	 "Then you must inquire how it is possible for you to identify what lies within: whether by means of the beak or by means of the nose: and if there are many orifices on one side, you should reach into them all at once with your full strength; but if the fistula has a long concavity near, or proximity, or if it is one with many orifices around, then reach in through what orifice you can to touch whatever lies within that area. And remember: when you use force and make an attempt on pain of causing harm to yourself by compressing something without knowing what it is.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 "Since you have reached its station securely and safely with your hand, then turn to its care now with confidence: and remember that if it is a fistula nearby visible, or close at the entrance of one opening, or on an artery or vein, or on any single of those I mentioned earlier, then dry out the fistula according to what was explained before by my writing, and take from it whatever lies within through its orifice. And please do remember: until you get a safe exit.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	 "If the fistula is very deep and according to its own nature then you must secure it securely by grasping into as deeply as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	 "After removing from all the corrupt parts.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	 "Next, with a medical instrument such as a scalpel or the like, remove what remains of the flesh that has been corrupted by fistulas, until the acute medicine completely removes all remaining corruption from fistulae resulting from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	 "Then restore it with ointments which heal flesh, until healing occurs.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	 "If not healed by that method alone, then burn the fistula as described in our previous response.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	 "If the cause of fistula is known to you, examine it and remove it in accordance with what we have previously described for you; if this does not disallow something from your hand or arm, burn it as instructed.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	 "If you find out what the cause of fistula is and there's evidence of corruption inside it; then burn that part until all corruption has been removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	 "After removing its corrupt parts as described before, care for it with what incites healing so that healing occurs.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	 "If not healed by that method alone, and you know now that you did not remove all the corruption; then burn it in accordance with what was shown to you.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	 "Then examine further upon that second thing and strive for its cure by all means within your power; then remove the corruption with utmost force.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	 "After removing it, restore it in accordance to our previous instructions.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	 "If so, then you know that the corruption is very deep within your body and you were not able to remove all of it.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	 "Therefore, you should either leave it as nature intended or seek another method for removing the corruption from that part.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	 "If a very small fistula is present, remove it with fine instruments used in surgery to treat such things.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	 "If there are many bones, then strive for the removal of all those bones without removing anything from them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	 "If something contrary arises from the moisture (such as an abscess) and you are not afraid of incisions or error; then cut through those moist areas if they exist there and release the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	 If you do not have a preparation of the bones from your time for eating them raw and let it be placed above the wounds that would rot it; then release it after it has rotted, so that what is putrefied around the bones of those who ate them may also become rotten.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	 And ensure the wound does not solidify
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	 And you ensured that a section was made according to your method of operating.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	 If you place it on top of itself if necessary, with the help of sulfur and trefoil with oil; or else put it into a vessel made from Egyptian unguent, or some other unguent's juice.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	 When those become putrefied by humidity and are separated from the bones, their release is made; and they draw in others.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	 If there is a large opening such as the openings of the thighs or anus, and similar to them; that which has become corrupted from it is part big; then remove it by its last reason until it has been made into black and corruption.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	 After this, you restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	 If the part of it that has become corrupted is big and corruption has already been completed with the bones; then it is necessary to clamp down on it and strike it totally until it reaches the location where corruption occurred; then care for it so that it solidifies
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	 And I say to you the manner by which a wound occurred on your own flesh; that you place it as an example and support above your method of operating.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	 There was a man in his youth about thirty years of age who had pained himself in his flesh because the cause which moved upon him inside his body until the matter reached his thighs and became great; and there was no external cause to it
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	 Therefore, time passed with him as long as the physicians' error continued until he opened up and confronted many materials.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	 His care was continued until his thighs were opened up and many openings had been made within him; all of which let out pus and the moisture of the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	 "In that period two years were needed for its treatment by many physicians, and it was not a person skilled in the art of hands until he spoke his name aloud, and I heard his voice; and from him I took the crusades (sword), which they use on their bodies. And everything related to this man's body had already been eaten up; and its color was blue.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	 "I therefore attempted to enter one of the openings mentioned earlier through the force of my effort, but I could not gain entrance into it.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	 "Then I examined thoroughly all of them and tried to enter through every one, but was unable to do so from any part of the body.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	 "Therefore I turned to one of the openings among them and attempted to enter through that part with force; but in entering it became corrupted, being already rotten and stained, and having been perforated, until finally I was able to reach its center.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	 "Therefore what had been detected by me from the corrupted bone was prepared for separation from it.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	 "I therefore took that which was not on the bone excepting corruption, which I separated off and severed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	 "And I had already removed it from its place.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	 "Then I placed the restoration of the bone with the strengthened medicines in a long space.
Et non est consolidatum.	 "And it was not reinforced.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	 "Therefore I turned to the next one above where the first was detected; and entered into it with continuing corruption, along with the bone; and severed what had appeared by me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	 "Then I attempted restoration of him (the man).
Et non est restauratum.	 "And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	 "Therefore I turned to him again and did not cease to strike the particular place; but attempted restoration of him (the man); and it was not restored until finally cutting off his bone through almost all its length, and taking that with his brain.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	 "Therefore I restored him with the medicines and it was strengthened and became healthy; but this repetition of mine was not necessary for his operation and cutting, except out of pity and compassion towards him (the man) and fear of death: because he fell by all means from too much evacuation and syncopal evils.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	 "Is it necessary to treat a complete injury? If so, the injury was caused by hard bone and good arrangement of the bones within his body; he had strength; and there was no impediment in any movement that would cause damage.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	 "If a bone of the body has been broken at its place, then you should lift him up as much as possible in that manner; it is to catch his ligaments and pull them taut on the prominent bones; hold fast unto him who stretches him upwards; and put another ligament over from coarse thread.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	 "Then put him back onto the flesh where the bone was broken; and stretch his extremities so that you may drag him downwards; and hold fast to the limb on which he stands so that he does not fall forward; and then you will take the limb above from beneath, lest it become loose.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	 "Then place a stick or board below the bone so that when you do this, it is not permitted to conceal the spoiled limb.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	 "It is necessary to have the sling above the spoiled limb so that there will be no injury from a crushing blow; and it does not appear on its own sense of touch, and he grasps towards his own sling with another.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	 "If the bone is spoiled and it's not prominent, then its parts will continue with another; and the injury is in between him or on his part.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	 "Then place a stick below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	 "After that the sling is put from the first part where the injury was, until it continues to the second; and the sling will be according to its length in opposition to the injury.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	 "If the injury is from the joint itself, cut off the spoiled joint; and then sling as much as possible from part two.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	 "If however the injury is between the two joints, there will be no damage except for cutting off one of them.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	 "If the injury is on the hand or foot itself; it then becomes very difficult to treat that part.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	 Indeed, you must know exactly how corruption appears before your eyes
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	 And you must grasp it, and apply that to whatever disposition may be most convenient for you, and with any kind of correction performed on your part, if the vein does not give forth its flow or the artery.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	 And you shall know that bones for incision are many in size and shape, according to their position within the body, and their preparation, thickness, subtlety, magnitude, durability, rarity, harshness, and scarcity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	 For this purpose you must bring to the use of all the instruments of every kind for that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	 And you shall know that these operations are indicated before your eyes when you see a very long tool in use.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	 The knowledge of the modes of this art is a proof of its severity; for now you see that through you he brought into use what was done with instruments against every ailment.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	 And I will stand steadfast to you at the end of this chapter and give you examples of instruments that are used over what strikes, as well as a trial for you to try them on others.
Forma Serrae.	 The forms of surgery.
Forma alterius Serrae.	 The alternative form of surgery.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 The alternative form of surgery is as follows:
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Here it is, the alternative mode of surgery:
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	 This drawn form of surgery should be followed carefully and diligently.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	 The bow must go above him with a sharpness that comes from steel, his hands he uses the axe and makes it pyramidal in its shape.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	 Form of tying up knots
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	 The head is the knot to be put together according to a star shape; and its points are arranged according to the design of the needles that tie it.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	 And not when it is tied together with him as a knot, unless its head is torn apart or large and swollen.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	 The form of tying up big knots.
Forma medii Rasorii.	 "A surgical form for the middle ear
Forma Rasorii lati.	 "Surgical form for the left ear
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	 "Form for the right ear, as it is called.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	 "Form for the other side of the head (right ear)
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	 "Surgical form for the right ear
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	 "Form for the other side of the head (right ear), as it is extended and turned.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	 "Surgical form with incision made in bones
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	 "Extraordinary surgical form for the middle ear
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	 This is similar to the radio (ear), and the extremity resembles a nail; it should be displayed in various places by reason of the bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	 "Surgical form corresponding to its perforation through the bones
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	 "The extremity has a triangular shape and is pointed at both ends.
Fit ex Indi.	 "It fits or suits well.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	 "Similarly, everything that we have said from the ear incision and saw should also follow this surgical form for the middle ear.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	 "Of the incision of extremities and cutting through bones
Caput LXXXIX.	 "End of the text
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	 "The extremities will rot either from external causes or internal ones.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	 "Because of your being a doctor and having made the effort to care for that corruption with medical means [i.e., by trying various treatments], yet you have not been able to prevent its spread: then it is necessary that you cut out this member from where its corruption proceeds up until when it affects, so as he may be saved through that [member] and avoid death or the greater harm which would come to his member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	 "And the sign of that [member] which has been harmed is that it is dishonored by its own name; either it will be burned up with fire or rot after death; until it is incised from that point on through to where it follows, and then spread throughout the body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	 "Therefore proceed with its incision and similarly if it is caused by the strike of various creatures; as a scorpion in the sea or a weaver or a miller.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	 If an injury or blow occurs at the extremity of a finger, then strike that finger and not allow it to be spoiled by the corruption, so as to reach up to the remaining hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	 Similarly if it happens to the hand itself, then strike off from its root the finger that is injured by a sharp blow and do not allow corruption spoil it until it reaches up to the arms.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	 And if it happens to the arm itself, then strike off from its joint the hand that is injured and do not allow corruption spoil it until it reaches up to its own junction (the elbow).
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	 If however a corruption passes around the arm, then there is death for that part of the body.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	 In addition to treating what has been corrupted by care, virtue amounts to quantity
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	 And similarly when an injury occurs on a finger, then strike off that finger at one joint and if it falls to the foot of the leg, then strike down the entire leg.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	 If however it ascends towards the elbow, then strike off the arm from its junction (the elbow).
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	 And if a corruption has already passed above the elbow, then there is no movement left to it except release and let go of what remains to be dead.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	 And the mode for striking a member is either by binding it tight or holding on to it and hitting from below, depending on whether you want to strike it with one ligature above or another ligature above its place (the location).
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	 And the other way of extending a ligature is by stretching it out to below and the other one up to above.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	 And you separate the meat that is between two ligatures with a Spathilus blow until the entire arm falls down (into its proper place).
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	 After this either it is struck or bound tight.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	 And you must lay down the blanket from all sides of the foot and not hit on it a healthy place (the sole) and strike to death what remains added and then release the cold finger.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	 And if you strike to death what remains inside a vein while working on it (or) immediately cauterize that place or lay down some other finger-tips cutting off the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	 In the meantime continue with your own treatment until it is completed
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 In the meantime stretch the injured limb with a suitable ligature and treat it to restore movement, until it becomes healthy again.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	 And I will tell you what fell upon your foot as well, that is the same accident which happened to me.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	 This is because a blackening occurred on your foot as well, due to the combination of dust and fire causing damage; this same accident also caused damage to my finger first, until it began to damage the entire hand.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	 Therefore the man took his own sword after having experienced damage to a limb due to excessive heat from it; and he then inflicted that upon an incision, until he became healthy again.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	 And after a long time had passed, the same accident happened to his finger as well on his hand's index finger.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	 So then he came to me and desired to recover that excess with him while he was applying ointment on his body after the completion of it; but no extra fluid remained, and he began to make incisions elsewhere in order to restore health to both hands until the corruption had taken hold of one hand entirely.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	 Therefore he came to me in order to make an incision on his hand; and he did not want that there should be any excess from me upon the death of his excess fluids; and I also feared that a death stroke would come upon him at my incision as well.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	 Because the man was skilled in weapons.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	 Therefore after he had despaired of me, he returned to his own land; and came back to me because he thought so, and made an incision on both hands completely until he became healthy again.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	 And do not translate this story unless you are a helper for what falls under the heading of these hardships; and that its meaning may be understood as it is written down according to how it is done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	 The care of yours with the quality of healing with the medicines.
Caput XC.	 "Head
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	 When a vein ruptures and bleeds into another part of the body (e.g., eye), it is sealed off by ligature until the bleeding stops; at that point it is known as an "eye fistula.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	 Its care is to treat the wound completely like it was made; and especially when it's delicate, as if it were a bandage being applied: and trust that it won't be placed with the location because of its own corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	 If the skin is damaged and it does not follow from that injury the last corruption; but if there's a wound caused by the flesh being cut off, then the care should be given to him with a needle (i.e., suture). And it is to consider going towards the Sinus as well
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	 Then if it is great and what goes out from that is foetid odor; then the needle should be inserted into him with the medicine of Egypt (i.e., bandage). And the parts receiving these things are equal, they will accumulate in your way: and they become covered by fire until the doctor arrives.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	 Then take what is necessary for you from that; and dissolve it with water and honey (i.e., bandage), and bind the Sinus with him as well. And close up his wound, and leave the medicine within him according to the quantity of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	 Then take it out with an expression; do that for days until the Sinus is cured and the odor is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	 And when the bandage is being burned with water of wine (i.e., alcohol), and it's not within your reach at that moment this medicine for ashes; or take ashes from wood or coals, and pour them on top of her.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	 Then apply the bandage to it, and bind it with that until you are sure the Sinus is healed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	 "If you are weak and cannot tolerate the smell of Egyptian medicines, nor drink their poison (i.e., urine), then wash him with water mixed with honey until some medicine prepared from aloes is applied to him.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	 "Wash him with water mixed with honey and vinegar until the excess of both liquids is removed; wash thoroughly to remove any remaining odor or residue left from urine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	 "When you have done this to some extent and are confident that the corruption of the nose has already receded; then wash him with the mixture used for making meat, so that it may be applied to him.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	 "And there are others to be used with the mixture of egg whites; and dissolve him with olive oil and vinegar until he is clean from all traces of them. Or wash him thoroughly with certain medicines, ointments, which I have written about in a treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	 "If the opening of the nose is narrow and cannot accommodate a cannula from clisteris; then expand him with stronger force by means of iron or apply to him the unguent of Egypt or the unguent of Basil for expansion.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	 "And similarly if it is an even wider opening, then close the mouth of him with stitches and release a quantity from it equal to that which should be added without additional ingredients.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	 "And similarly if the opening from which the discharge of pus flows downward is widened; it is to be released upward towards the upper part; then dry him in a lower place where he is, so that it may flow out through this and reach the bottom until when the discharge stops because the flesh is prevented from generating there.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 "If it is not possible for you to dry the nose from below as described; then scrape gently and prepare a membrane by which the discharge of pus will flow out with ease, just as that has been prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	 "Scrape gently and catch anything that may remain from the discharge of pus; and take consolidated medicines to be placed above the sign.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	 Extend them above the linen
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	 And place the linen a certain quantity of it so that communication may flow into the whole sinus (sinus means nose).
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	 Then make an incision with a sharp instrument at the entrance to the hole on the head of the sinew so that it opens wider than before.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	 Next extend the other linen with slender fingers in proportion to the size of the holes and place it on top of itself, longways so that its outlet is opposite to the opening of the sinus.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	 The one that is above the opening of the sinus, is he whom you remove at all hours so as to go away what has gathered in him from pus and thus you know if it flows out through him or not.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	 And considering the place of the sinus itself, if there be a lord's pain in him or not and whether it is there a hole or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	 Thus your treatment proceeds so and you know the matter which is placed over the opening of the sinus; then you know whether it has adhered or not.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	 If however the flow from the sinus is subtile and long after a delay of many hours or days then you do not worry for its release because it seeks treatment by those who hasten the generation of flesh in their bodies and by those who hinder him,
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	 If however the flow from the sinus is many days long and digested then you know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	 If therefore the delay of its release and prolongation of it happen then you will add to their treatment the application of medical ointments by physicians so that the medicine may be moist and slimy like a linen; thus as the unguent of dyafininicon is added into him when he has excesses in addition from excess.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	 And further than that which is being treated, you will apply the unguent of dyafininicon and it will be dissolved with sweet oil and there will flow into him old wine equal to its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	 "In this case, insert that object with him and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	 After doing so, when the object is not currently available to you, remove it and then perform this operation on what remains of him/it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	 Take myrrh or aloes, or both; tear and pound them thoroughly; cover it with oil while it is still hot over fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	 After performing this operation on him/it, place a bandage over his head and tie it to the top of the rope; then draw out what you tore off carefully so that it becomes one piece again; cover it with oil after removing it from the fire.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	 And sometimes when administering this operation on him/it you will find Aristolochia longissima and Lilium, the roots of lilies of heaven; and there is also centaurea.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	 Use them individually or in groups, tear off the chaff/shells and cover it with oil; then use what remains of him.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If the matter has already been prolonged from his sinus and not healed by this treatment; then you understand that corruption is already deep within him/it; or it makes an impression on bones or tough parts like ligaments; at that point treat him for fistulas according to what was prescribed.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	 For the treatment of ulcers and nails falling off: and cutting them off with a knife/sword; and making a cut in addition to that.
Caput XCI.	 Head 100
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	 An ulcer is born under the thumb/finger of the hand or foot; and sometimes it is born on one of the other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	 If the matter has been prolonged and neglected treatment of him; or apostemated by cold hands (hands); or it is burned off with fire; or it becomes corrupted from root to end/tip of nail, as far down as nose; sometimes it covers up corruption all over, sometimes leads to corruption in mouth until odor of the foetus arises, and results in loss of finger tip.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	 When you cure him/it as prescribed by the surgery; and when you cut off with knife all that remains from his finger...
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	 After cautery, burn a wound.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	 Cautery is an instrument of healing.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 If you are healthy and the hand is also good, then it starts to cut into the meat from its interior, it starts to itch itself, it is itching: at that point it needs to put a subtile Radium under an angle of the hand which bites the flesh, and pull her away. And once she has been pulled out by this instrument made of corrosive medicine, then place on top of what remains from meat after removal of medicines with corrosive agents until all is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then cure it with ointments, until it heals
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	 If however corruption has already occurred at the mouth, then you should cut away that part and remove it immediately because nothing can heal while something corrupt is left inside.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	 If you see that corrosion and corruption have entered the finger, then cut away that part from one joint, according to what has been remembered of him.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then cure it, until it heals
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 If you have injured the hand or hit it, then there must be given first to the patient a phlebotomist
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	 Then dry the limb with quick and severe sectioning downward from the top toward the bottom.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	 And be careful lest the section goes into the flesh beneath the finger, for you will cause pain to the patient who is under it, and there will remain a spot added by birth of flesh where that happened
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	 Then cure the place which causes the pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	 The hand that is added to the people, may be very useful for all flesh; and bones of some are also present in it, and the finger has a nail: and there can be born from its junction or from one finger's knot some persons' births.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	 He who is born among the fingers cannot be removed; and he who is born from the finger's junction may possibly be removed.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	 "For him who has mastered these (surgical techniques), the section for him is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	 To hit upon a root with a club or cudgel from the left side.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	 The care of him whose birth is at the junction of the incision, is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	 Do not then cut off (his hand)
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	 To him who is born from the finger at the end of the nerves, it should be so that you hit his hand with a round knife to the nose.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	 Then cut off his head with one of the knives suitable for such purpose.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And then take care of him until he is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	 The consolidation which has struck the fingertips is often followed by birth, that is, he was born with it or from burning wood, or fire, etc..
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	 It is therefore necessary to cut off the consolidation so that his fingers can return to their original shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	 Then place a ligature between them or weave the pannus into olive oil so that they do not heal immediately but are separated; then put a thin strip of lead between them until the consolidation is complete in accordance with what is necessary.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	 And similarly if a consolidation has struck the palm of his hand, then dry off that consolidation in accordance with what was prepared and fitted for the shape of the body part.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	 "Of cutting off the vitriol.
Caput XCII.	 Head X-II
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	 The veins are often burst from the swelling and overflow of melancholy fluids which occur in many parts of the body; and most frequently they come out in the arms, particularly in the arms of those who work much and labor hard, as well as in those that carry burdens.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	 Therefore it is necessary to administer a purging with black bile frequently by a strong discharge, so that the veins may be restored and not burst too often due to swelling and melancholy fluids.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	 Then take care of the patients who have suffered from venepuncture in his arm.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	 Curatio and cure with iron is done according to two methods
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	 The blood is removed as they proceed
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	 And the other method is to puncture a vein and remove it with the whole.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The section (of the body) must be done according to this way
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	 First, with warm water, stir until the bad blood is released.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	 Then, tie the lower leg to the upper thigh using a rope.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	 Next, cut open an area on one side or both sides and make it wide.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 Then take the bad blood from your lower leg up to the top and put it into an empty container on one side or both sides first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	 Next, cut off the leg up to below with it and let it bleed as much blood as you can until you have enough or tolerate what is left from the weakness of the patient.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	 Then bind them and give the patient something to prevent nausea from black bile: and do another evacuation and phlebotomy when they are needed and it harms him.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The removal is done according to this way.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	 Remove the hair on the lower leg if there are many hairs there.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	 Next, put it into a bath or stir with warm water until the vein becomes red and the veins are released, one way or another.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	 Then, make an incision along its length on one side or the other and tie it off at the knee or below for removal.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	 Next, open the incision and remove as much of it as you can until it becomes black or dark red, then take it away from him so that he may see it clearly.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	 Now when you have cut open the incision make her white like a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	 Next, put it under a glass container until you cut open the incision and remove her from the skin.  Bind her with a rope on one side loosely.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	 Then make another incision near it for three fingers
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	 Then remove the skin from above
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	 Then hold her with one hook like you did before and suspend her with another hook just as you did before.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	 If necessary make more than one incision to reach the desired result.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	 Then remove her from near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	 Then take her out to the incision above her.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	 And do this until you remove her from the upper incision or from all sections around to the point where she is whole; then make another incision.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	 If you cannot remove her through the upper incision or all sections around to the point where she is whole; then put a double-hook on either side and tie her securely there; alternatively go under it with a hook: and come back with your hand to every part, until you reach her completely.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	 And that's all.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	 If you cannot remove her in the same way as before or from above; if this is not possible and you lose hold of her, it will be difficult for you to pull out any part of her, because she has become weak due to loss of blood.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Once you have removed her completely; then put a hook under the arm or leg and pull it out with oil or wine; alternatively give it a good rub of oil until she is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	 If the veins are contracted and difficult to remove due to their tortuous nature; then it is necessary for you to find a way to pull her out of all parts affected by this, and cure these incisions as well.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	 Then suspend her with hooks; until you remove her completely and tie a knot at the place of your incision to prevent injury to her there, or support her through her ordeal, for it will be difficult to remove her or pull her out from under such conditions.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	 And show great care in all that you do.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	 Form for cutting off fruit
Forma Vncini caeci.	 Form of applying unguent
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 It is not to be administered in the same way as other unguents, nor for extreme cuts or bruises; so that it would have harmed one of them (if applied with its own force): but because if it were delicate and tender, it might cause harm through its own gentleness: so that an excess of this ointment should never be excessive, except when it is fat-like.
De extractione Venae cruris.	 Extraction of veins from the leg.
Caput XCIII.	 Head 33
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	 This vein is generated on the feet of the Arabs and the cold lands, like the veins of Alizegi; but the dry land and the hot land it generates as well, because its tender parts are lacking there - that is to say, in places where no herb or tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	 And perhaps veins may be generated elsewhere on the body beyond the limbs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	 Its generation is due to the corruption that occurs beneath the flesh, like how snakes and vipers are born inside the bodies of men; so too do its births occur from the corruption between the skin and meat.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	 The sign of its excision is this: if it causes inflammation on someone's thigh.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	 After that place must be seared off.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	 After that the vein is excised from its place of excision, as if it were a root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	 When that extremity appears after it, then he must apply a bandage soaked in the same weight of silver coin to cover its surface; and it is held fixed by means of a leaden strip from head to foot - until two drachmas are released; and let him release the suspended lead after it.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	 For as long as there is something to be extracted from that vein externally, he must bandage it with silver coins soaked up to its surface; and let him release a leaden strip all the way around - until two drachmas are released.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	 If prolonged much, then he must cut off its part and bandage what remains.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	 Do not cut it off before all of it is extracted completely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	 "When a lancet is inserted against (the body), it holds and draws blood into itself; and thus it inflicts injury on the vein with which it comes into contact, causing death to the part around it, and ulceration of bad quality.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	 "Therefore it ought to be handled with care, gently withdrawn from the body at once and as quickly as possible, so that no trace of its having been there may remain within the body; for thus by withdrawing a little bit every time, it may never reach any part which is beyond five palms in length and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	 "And so I saw (it), because its path was obstructed by a hand from the XXth palm.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	 "If a lancet were to be inserted into you during the time of your treatment; then its path is interrupted by that vein's entrance, and it penetrates the said vein deeply for a long time while touching the body until all that remains from it in the material has been exhausted, and administers the rotting of place with medicines on the days after.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	 "Then he turns his attention to curing the lancet's injury.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	 "This vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the insertion of a foot, or on that same foot.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	 "Therefore he ought to cure this one as we have said regarding division and with what was previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	 "Of the incision above worms of the womb; it is called 'Bouina's sharpness'.
Caput XCIIII.	 "The 14th head.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	 "This 'sharpness' is called 'Bouina sharpness', because many worms have been made by it and are now few in number; for they arise between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	 "And it is spread throughout the body, ascending and descending; and appears to the senses during the movement of its member towards another, until some trace of having been there disappears from any part of the body.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	 "Its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	 In like manner are worms and snakes, that is, laths and lice on man
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	 For he fears the evil of his
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	 Because when he himself entered into the body and was elevated to his head, and settled there, then suddenly he opened upon him and delivered up [his soul], and destroyed his eye; and he killed that one many times
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	 Therefore, how to care for him and remove him, then it did not happen there except from his walking around and the appearance of that one's senses.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	 Therefore, so that you hold what is above him, and what is below with a strong cord and constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then dry up [his] above, and remove him from there.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	 If it penetrates into the flesh, then do not let him out of this place with a cautery [instrument] while fire is present, until he dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	 And greater fear there was, corruption to his was, by which his eye was corrupted like what we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	 If you now wish to remove him from near the head towards the eye, then hold it below on his forehead with a strong constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then dry up [his] above, and remove him from there.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	 It is necessary that the weak one must be made to pass away through corruption of his own body with drugs that dissolve bad smells.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	 And let him feed himself from food-givers causing putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	 About the section over the burden of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	 One hundred and fifty [the] head of.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	 This burden is called Nakir on our earth, and there was a pain that struck some of the members; then it transfers from one member to another member.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And I myself now saw him, as what I have told you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	 I am called upon by a sick woman among the women.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	 And he took his arm and saw puffiness of the vein in both arms.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	 After an hour has passed and one has had a haemorrhage from the veins with a knife, as it would happen to arteries when they are cut open; so that he may ascend to the location of his elbow as much as possible: thus let him be like running blood when flowing from one place to another.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	 The pain therefore subsided at this place and was fixed at the elbow
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	 After a short time had passed, and when blood continued to flow from the remainder of his body, until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	 After that, I was told because he had lost consciousness throughout his entire body as I said earlier.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	 Therefore, it seemed to me that the movement of his limb from one member to another had been lost.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	 And I myself did not see this agitation in my eyes as it was happening according to that way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	 However, I saw many who changed the pain from one member to another; but I did not see him with his eyes as he was doing it like a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	 Therefore, I do not think that this is because a woman was present among those who are accustomed to detecting the sick with their eyes; hence it seems to me that there is an agitated feeling being changed by its movements.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	 It is necessary then for those who are delighted and whose bodies are full of delight to not be present among those who detect the sick by their eyes, and the hidden ones.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	 Thus, with the care of his senses and feeling the pain as a patient feels it; if you see this agitation in your eye, as we said earlier, then tighten above him and below too on him; and as long as he stays there without moving, so that the agitated feeling is cut off.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	 If you do not see him with your eyes, then carefully remove his body and accompany them by the feathers of the little birds, the feathers of the swallow or any other that is similar to those.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	 The extraction of the arrows
Caput XCVI.	 One hundred and six.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	 The joints differ according to their nature and the places where they fell off the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	 Their difference is because some of them have sharp points, and others are blunt; and some are concave, and some are convex.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	 And from these there are three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	 From them there are the tongues
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	 And from these there are stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	 The second type of difference is according to the two modes of those which fell off through the members.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	 Or if from the main parts of the members those which fell off through them are by the two modes as is the head and heart and liver and lungs and kidneys and bladder and all similar things
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	 When therefore one of the members falls and you see signs of death which I tell you after this then it is necessary that you should pull out those joints from there because death follows him in many positions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	 And if to you these bad signs are not evident and the joint is hidden in the member's depth then pull it out and make sure it is secure.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	 From the head when it falls and it penetrates the nose and it is covered with phlegm which is above the head there are those which fall from him sneezing and blindness and vertigo and redness in the eyes and swelling and redness of the tongue and spasms and mixture of intellects and cholera death.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	 And it may also be that blood comes out through the nose or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	 Or the speech may be cut off and destroyed by the wind.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	 And it may also happen that from a wound in the head there comes forth white pus-like fluid.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	 And it may come out of him like water and excrement.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	 If therefore these signs are evident then stay from the cure and pull out the joint if it is not removed
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	 When an arrow falls into the heart, there are two possibilities: either it lodges near the left breast or by chance it fixes firmly on the hard part of the chest and does not fix onto the soft part
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	 It is possible that an arrow falls with a force similar to the force of the heart's pulse, and it may run out through the wound, causing black blood to flow forth.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	 It is followed by extreme coldness in extremities (of body), and cold sweat, and numbness.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	 Therefore, it can be said that death was close but not quite at hand.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	 When an arrow lodges in the lung, it is said to be a sign of death by blood's exit from the wound; and those that follow behind may cease, or change their color, becoming pale.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	 And the large breath expires high up in the air, seeking cold air's attraction.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	 If an arrow falls into the arm, it is near to the back; and there occurs a great breath with pain in the shoulder, accompanied by a sigh, and all the members of the arms may tremble.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	 If an arrow lodges in the stomach, it is possible that some indigested food will come forth from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	 If an arrow lodges in the rectum or anus, it may cause something foul from the wound to come forth; either excrement, or a ruptured part of the intestine that has already been disrupted.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	 Therefore, there is no hope for his cure and no way to remove the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If an arrow lodges into the bladder and urine comes forth from it, something foul will come out; there is a stronger pain on top of weakness; you know that this is mortal
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	 The muscles and the joints also give out in many ways like faces; the collarbones, the shoulder blades, the elbow joints, the elbows, the wrists, the buttocks, and the thighs will also be affected when an arrow does not reach a vein or artery; it is an arrow that has become useless.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	 I tell you what I learned from Albucasis about arrows, that they are used in conjunction with your treatment
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	 Because a bow struck the eye of a man while he was crying and entered his nose
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	 Therefore, I removed it from the other side of his face and placed it beneath his ears: he was cured without any harm to him.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	 Therefore I took another arrow from the Jews who had struck him under his eye, beneath his lower eyelid; and it was hidden so that its use did not come through except for part of his cheek near to where it would have been attached on his wood: and the arrow was large with a curved shaft like the Turks' arrows made by iron, which does not have ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	 Therefore, the Jew is cured without any harm to him from an arrow incident injury.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	 And I took another arrow from Christians' quiver:
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	 It was an Arabic arrow and it did have ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	 Therefore I put the two arrows over his head together, and she was hidden beneath them in his quiver.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	 Therefore I became skilled with her, until I took away from him; and the Christian is cured.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	 And we thought about it because he was suffering from this arrow.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	 After thirty days had passed by him and no change was made upon him from the dispositions of his own, I took the arrow; and my mind put it there for use, and I removed her; and he is cured without any harm to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	 And I saw a man whose arrow had struck his back: and it was set fast upon her.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	 After seven years the arrow left from his waist.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	 I saw a woman whose arrow had struck into her breast; and it was set fast upon her. And the arrow remained within her: and no change occurred from disposition of hers, and she did not receive any harm from any of her own actions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	 A man struck another with an arrow in his face and the wound was closed, but he did not endure much pain; similar things happened to others
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	 A royal arrow was drawn out from the head of a man who had been hit by it through his nose; and it had already declined towards the right side
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	 I am therefore to look after him until three days after he has removed the arrow
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	 The wound of the arrow was firmly closed
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	 I tried with great effort and did not feel it; and he himself felt the pain in his ear on the right side from being hit by the arrow.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	 I therefore believed that the wound was caused at the extreme end of the arrow
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	 I therefore placed a bandage over the place where there was attraction of the arrow's power and digging out; confident that this place would be removed, and it showed me the sign of the arrow so that I could draw it away from its place: and it did not happen at the place in which the arrow had been stuck.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	 I therefore kept bandaging over him for many days; and it did not happen to be injured because the wound was closed temporarily; he remained weak from drawing out his arrow until he felt an arrow in his nose on a certain day
Et narrauit mihi illud.	 He told me this.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	 I therefore put over this wound an acute medicine, corrosive for many days; until it was opened up; and with great effort tried to draw him, but felt the subtle end of the arrow which was sticking into the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	 Afterwards I added to the opening of his wounds that acute medicine; until it appeared before us how far the arrow was sticking out, and there remained with me for about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	 Afterwards when the wound had been enlarged and it became possible for me to insert my fingers into it and move it around; but it did not obey at its exit: then I did not stop twisting around with the methods of children until a certain day came with very painful efforts, according to which it was shaped out in the end, until I drew her away.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	 I have restored the wounds
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	 And doctors say that the nasal cartilage should not be repaired.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	 Therefore I have restored this one and it is now healed in its entirety without causing any harm to him at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	 And I inform you of the quality, extent and position of those things that need to be removed so that you can place them in their appropriate rule and meaning as I have indicated.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	 Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with the narration; nor was it comprehended by that book or wise artificer (craftsman); he was compared to a little for many, and when absent from what is present, he brought down a new operation and a new instrument among external things in those arts which had happened.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	 I therefore declare that the arrows are not drawn from the members to which they are attached except by two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	 Or through attraction from where he went in.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	 Or conversely the parts of another.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	 That which is drawn to where he went inward may either proceed from there as a shaft penetrating fleshly; or it can be drawn by attraction toward itself.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	 If it does not arrive at the exit from the hour that he falls; then you should let him rest a certain number of days until his flesh decays around him and he is freed by the force of his own going away.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	 Similarly if there is a figure in bone and does not arrive at the exit for you; then let him rest equally that number of days until he has been removed by attraction and motion every day until he is drawn away.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	 If it does not arrive at the exit after days; then you should perform a figure of arrows from all sides around him from each side gently with a subtle spear until they are expanded.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	 Then draw her away and remove her.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	 If the arrow is fixed in bone of the skull and has already reached one channel of the brain; and you have noted some accidents which I mentioned before; then stay away from drawing arrows to him until he is equal after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	 If an arrow pierces through a sinew, then death cannot be prolonged for him
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	 But if an arrow is not fixed but penetrates only to the bone and does not reach through the sinew, then he remains incapacitated for a while, but nothing happens to him from these accidents; at that point, the mind pulls it back with its own force and extracts it out of itself.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	 If the arrow is fixed and does not reach you to the bone, then administer terebellum around it as if tying a rope; from there take care of its location until he recovers.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	 If the arrow has already been removed at the place of the body and is hidden or concealed from view; then examine it with care when you take hold of it.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	 If you feel it (i.e., the arrow), then tie it up securely with some instruments that will hold on to its removal from there.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	 If you cannot hold onto it because of the swelling or length of the arrow, and there is no opening, no slit for removing it; then find somewhere above to hold it tight until its swelling decreases and it becomes possible to remove the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	 If you hold onto his ears tightly, then release the fixed meat from all sides and with whatever force you can break it loose; if not, use your ingenuity to snap or bend its ears until he releases them.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	 And when you administer the extraction of an arrow wherever it is, use your force with both hands and instruments to all parts until you remove her; and with ultimate subtlety, so that she does not break, making it difficult for you to pull on it and its removal.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	 If you cannot remove her after one day, then let her remain for several days until she becomes rotten or spoiled from its position.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	 Then you will repeat the process; if anything goes contrary to your order it causes a flow of blood; then administer what we have said from care in its chapter and guard your strength so that no wound is inflicted upon you or an instrument used.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	 "And by every way possible to administer any vein as you like; and that should be done with ease, tranquility, speediness or patience, firmness or gentleness, according to your will.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	 "You should do it while you hold the vein so that weakness might be according to its figure, as it was at the time of cutting from the vein.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	 "Since then (i.e., after practicing)
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	 "If not that, you should administer the one which is possible from figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	 "The vein which is named from the contrary part of another one or has already proceeded to something external; it does make weakness at the extremity by feeling from above the closest parts of the skin and you recognize its prominence, so therefore over it, and should be cut according to how much they can carry in it with their fingers.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	 "After that you hold her, she becomes easy for getting out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	 "If you hold on to the bone, then stretch your hand according to its roundness until you press the vein into the bone and it expands itself; after that you should pull her.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	 "And if not, let it go off for a few days: then repeat it until you get rid of it.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	 "If the vein is found to be made from bone, then pull her with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	 "If the vein has been found to be cut from bone, and you are ordered to administer pressure; then insert into her an instrument curved so that its fullness is put inside of the artery of the vein; after that pull her with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	 "If the vein has been found to be curved, then pull her into herself with an instrument inserted into her.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	 "The vein is cut through that way.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	 "If the vein has been found to be poisoned, you must, until you have finished all the meat from which it is found; if possible, do that.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	 "After that, take care of her in what was suitable for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	 "If a testicle falls into the chest or abdomen or scrotum, or anus, and is grasped by the hand while being pressed down upon it; then if you attempt to pull out [the object] at that instant as it comes out of its place (its own) towards your body, an extraction can be made from it. Then wash away with a solution and cut off any pus, or remove it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	 "Then seek medical attention if you are able to do so, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	 "This [description of the instrument used] is how testicles are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	 "The limbs resemble a bow when they grasp it; but once taken away from the testicles, they do not give back.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	 "Many shapes and sizes are produced by them; great ones, moderate ones, small ones, and ones in the middle according to their size of testicles and the power over them.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	 "This is how they help or assist when grasped upon [by someone].
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	 "And this [description] shows the opposite; they hinder and prevent when taken away from.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	 "This is like a radius to enter into the testicles with an outstretched finger and assist them as you press upon them.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	 "The extremity of the instrument is shaped like a pen's tail; to help it enter into them and push upon them as you pull.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	 "Of [venous] bleeding.
Caput XCVII.	 "Chapter Seventy-Seven
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	 "The veins of which are customarily found within the body are thirty.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	 "From which there are six veins coming from the head; two veins for the ears and their names, two arteries visible only in the upper part of each arm with their names, two veins named Aspicientes running behind the eyes and the name of one vein behind the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	 "And two cervical veins
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	 "And two veins running within the upper lip of each mouth.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	 Two veins which are located in the lower lip
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	 These are the veins called "Algecherich".
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	 Two veins which are below the tongue
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	 Veins that branch off from these veins mentioned earlier are five in each arm
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	 These are the facial veins and one vein located at the back of the skull is called 'ulnar'.
Et Fusca.	 The basilar vein
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	 This is the media vein and it is composed of branches from both the Basilar and Cephalic veins, and is called 'brachioradialis'.
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	 The basilar vein which runs through the back of the skull and one vein located at the front of the arm are called 'brachioradialis' (the veins in the arm) and 'Titillicus' respectively.
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	 And this is the internal jugular vein
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	 This is the funicular artery of the arm and it lies above the elbow joint; from this vein comes that which is visible when the hand is dropped down to one's side.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	 The Salutation artery and its two branches are between the annulus and the small artery, and they supply blood to the arm.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	 There are three veins located on the forehead and foot respectively.
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	 These veins run from the back of the hand to the front of the wrist.
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	 The second is called 'saphenous' and it lies at the heel behind the ankle joint, from which vein runs that in the hand to the thumb.
Et uena Nesse: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 The third one is called 'Nesse'.
Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	 There are three more veins on the forehead similarly to those mentioned earlier.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	 About the phlebotomy of two veins after auricles
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	 The phlebotomy of the two veins mentioned after auricles consists in cutting off the ear and the nose and making an incision at the back of the head, and in treating with old remedies, bandaging, cauterizing, and curing the wounds of the heads.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	 The quality of the phlebotomy is according to what is narrow.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	 It is necessary that a head dressing be applied and hair of the forehead be shaved with scissors.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	 After this, the patient ties his own collar using thread; until two veins are visible on each side.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	 The ears lie down behind the temples at a height of two fingers below the top of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	 Therefore take them with your finger and when you find their roots under your finger, there tie a knot with resin.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	 After this, take the phlebotomist's bowl; it is called Incidens by some.
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	 After this, put him into a bandage so that he may drip the blood onto the mouth
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	 Then take hold of your finger with a bandage and cut off one vein at its top.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	 The length of the incision should be equal to twice the length of your fingers joined together; either straight or in a circle around it and release the blood as much as you can.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	 After this, tie him with threads until he is free from pain.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	 And now the beginning of the book has been introduced and their cauterization has taken place.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	 The subject matter of two veins which are cut out in time
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	 The subject matter of two veins which are cut out in time is that by means of phlebotomy the ancient and modern methods should be known to us; so also how we may make a quick incision, quickly extract the flowing blood from the eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	 The quality or manner in which you remove them is according to what you have been told.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	 The patient ties his own collar firmly until two veins of the face are visible; and their pulse will be felt under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	 Then tie a knot with resin.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	 Then take hold of the finger at its top and put him into a bandage so that his drip may be onto the forehead.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 "Cut it off like you did with two veins and others; then make a current flow from its blood according to the need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	 After that, take hold of the vein with one finger at once
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then grasp your own hand and its fingers, and strangle it by a strong constriction; then release it, so that the patient may recover.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	 And now you have finished their remembrance, their incision, and the extraction of their book.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	 After cephalic phlebotomy comes venipuncture (venepuncture).
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae uenae frontis est post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad aegritudines faciei antiquas: et ad hemigraneam, et rubedinem: et ulcera foeda.	 The wound from the first venepuncture after cephalic phlebotomy is after old-fashioned bruises on the face; to its swelling and bleeding; and a sore or ulcer
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And the quality of that phlebotomy is according to what you have opened up in it.
Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	 The patient's hand with its fingers is bound by a strong constriction until it appears
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	 After that you take the thing called the forceps.
Cuius haec est forma.	 Its form is as follows:
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	 Take the highest point on the head of the forceps and strike above it with the fingers or another part as necessary; then release the flow of blood according to how much you need.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	 After that, take hold of the perforation with one finger at once.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	 And sometimes when you are with a venepuncture on the opposite side.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	 However, it is not necessary that the phlebotomy be from the very tip of one's hand as in other cases; rather it should be from an open palm.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	 The venepuncture is done according to the incision; which is close by, and it may be that the phlebotomy breaks when it is soft.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	 After cephalic phlebotomy comes venipuncture from two lachrymal veins (tear ducts).
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	 The wound from the venipuncture of two lachrymal veins is after old-fashioned bruises on the face; to its swelling and bleeding; and soreness of the eye, and old-fashioned pains on the face.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	 And the quality of the veins is such that when they are pressed with a tourniquet the injured limb will be drawn towards itself
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	 After the veins have been taken, you place them on his head
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	 You tie a tourniquet at a point that is below the length of the veins but above their size, so as not to obstruct them where they exit the body.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	 If the tourniquet is too loose on the extremities it may break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	 After this you draw off as much blood as necessary for you.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	 And place them on top of each other and tie them at night so that they may be loose when needed.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	 The veins of the nose are taken
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.

Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	 And the quality of his veins is such that when pressed with a tourniquet the injured limb will be drawn towards itself.
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	 Then hold the nose of his left hand and take a subtle vein from it; and tie him between two veins that were distinguished by the nose according to their lengths.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	 Because one cannot see there, and because blood starts to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	 And you should tie the tourniquet at a point that is below the length of the veins but above their size so as not to obstruct them where they exit the body, and draw off as much blood as necessary for your benefit.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	 And ligate her at night one.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	 His will be restored quickly.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	 The veins of the eyelid are taken
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	 The veins of the eyelid are taken because they cause a desire to constriction and the expulsion of scabs, and black spots on the face; and with ulcers, and wounds caused by biting creatures, that is, reptiles.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	 And the quality of their veins is such that when pressed with a tourniquet the injured limb will be drawn towards itself and remain fastened on top of his head while he lies down
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	 After removing the vein and stretching it out for a distance of one hand's breadth
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	 Then remove from the blood an amount equal in temperature to what you see as necessary for that
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	 And then repeat the same with another vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	 Afterwards, sew up the ligature of each of these two veins so that they are not easily parted.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	 And remove it from your hand.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	 Then take care of the wound.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	 Of the removal of veins by Albucasis
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	 The purpose of the removal of veins by Albucasis is to drain blood from the mouth and gums, prevent ulcers on the tongue, heal wounds, sores or cuts on any part of the body, as well as those inside the nose or on its surroundings.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	 And the quality is such that you can perform it without causing harm to an ill person in your presence, and sew up his neck with a thread.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	 Afterwards return to the lips and gently apply two veins, one on each side of his mouth; then demonstrate their respective positions by examining them in red light.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	 And this is it because the veins are very small and black.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	 Then cut off both with one incision.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	 If you are doubtful and don't know which ones they are, then make a larger cut that will reveal them better.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	 And then make the same cut for both veins that are in the upper lip, and it is customary to do so when you have them; then cut two veins that are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	 Of the removal of veins below the tongue after cephalic vein phlebotomy
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	 The purpose of removing veins below the tongue after cephalic vein phlebotomy is to drain blood from the throat and ulcers, as well as prevent further erosion of the mouth and lips.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	 The quality of phlebotomy should be such that the patient lies between your hands and is exposed to light from above; and let him have one lancet on each side, with which he may pierce his tongue.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	 Phlebotomy therefore both of you to attend that your hand is not injured in the process.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	 There are arteries beneath him; and perhaps he may suffer loss of blood from these arteries
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	 Of three veins in a hand
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	 The three veins that are usually used for phlebotomy, located in the hand, are common to all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	 Phlebotomy of these is done according to two ways
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	 Either by piercing with the lancet made from myrtle wood or using a sharp edge for cutting; either by pulling gently upon the vein and twisting it; or by scraping off with the phlebotomist's knife: that is phlebotomy in its simplest form.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is how he does it.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	 Thus, for phlebotomy agrees with cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	 The large and narrow forms of phlebotomy using myrtle wood are as you would expect them to be.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	 Phlebotomy agrees with opening large veins and cutting through fat ones, making them visible, full of blood, red in color, broad in size and filled with thick, dark blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	 The phlebotomist is of narrower dimensions than the large phlebotomy form, and more subtle than that one.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	 Phlebotomy agrees with the subtler veins which carry clear blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	 Of phlebotomy in the church.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	 The church which is one of three places for phlebotomy is set apart.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	 Because it gives rise to blood from the arteries in the neck and armpit, following which part of the body is unknown; therefore phlebotomy should be made with care by the phlebotomist so that he may take a sample without fear, for there under it lies an artery
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	 If there is an error and it was added while taking care of the vein puncture, it will cause injury to the artery, and blood flow stops
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	 He should not strike a vein when puncturing with the phlebotomist's needle: let there be a separation between them
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	 If the basilica of an appearance is not manifest at that time, it should be taken as if he had another vein, and you are to change over to another one, or else you may wound someone's arm with his own phlebotomist needle: or else strike a vein somewhere in its elbow.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	 This is manifest and let her go along with the phlebotomist of Anesil as we have already said
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	 However, if you are to perform the phlebotomy on this same vein of his own, then it is necessary before making an incision in the arm so that you strike a place, until you know exactly where the pulse is located.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	 After striking on the place with a heated probe, afterward you make an incision in the arm and then let one vein be cut off with the phlebotomist of Anesil as we have already said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	 And so that no injury occurs due to striking at a space within the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	 And when you know that with tightening of the ligature and inflating at a place where you have struck with a heated probe, then this inflation is an inflation artery: so therefore she was inflated.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	 If you see blood near the phlebotomy go up with urine as a child does, and it is clear that there are fine veins, then this is because the artery has been damaged through blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	 After that you press firmly with your finger upon a space for a long time and then remove it.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	 If the blood is cut off then tightly hold on to your arm and let it go; and there will be an attack by weakness of his motion; and so it must remain over fear in him.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 And not move this for a long time until he is cured.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	 However if the blood is not cut off and you see it then do not stay present at your moment of medicine; and so strike an artery as he appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	 The hand is amputated and bleeding blood
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	 Remove the fist bone and take hold of it; then take one medium sized thread and tie it over a fresh healthy vein with a knot and the thread's end tied up until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	 Once the hand is amputated, it is good
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	 If it fails and the memory of those who preceded him has been forgotten by the flow of blood from the cuts: then cutting off his own blood is not difficult because of the abundant veins or possible use of a bandage
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	 From the vein in the forearm.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	 The vein of the arm is a type of phlebotomy that carries blood from the top part of the head down to the lower body; because it's made up of parts such as the artery to the brain and the artery to the abdomen, just like I said before.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	 The bandage was placed over the vein from which blood flowed out of his body; because below it is a nerve
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	 If he added a wound to the phlebotomy and it caused him to faint from shock: then his treatment was difficult, possibly resulting in loss of consciousness.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	 The nerve is seen by many times
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	 If it is hidden by some people and is thin so that it's not seen; then you should put your phlebotomy over them like the one I described, making a cut with an alnesil and tying up the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	 If it's between two nerves, find one of its lengths.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	 From the vein in the head.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	 The vein of the head is a type of phlebotomy that carries blood from the top of the head down to the eyes; because it's part of the artery in the brain.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	 If you're using this one, then tie it with a phlebotomist or the myrrh phlebotomist; because it is better than any other, as it isn't a vein and doesn't have a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	 "However you must meet with the phlebotomist to receive only the head of the hare and you will find a lesser place; but it shall not harm him if he does not come together with the first blow, so that he may be hit with the phlebotomy afterward.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	 "However, it will occur to some men when they do not have phlebotomy during the first blow, but it shall not harm them that way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	 "About the usefulness of phlebotomy and caution should be taken about it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	 "The quality of phlebotomy and its accidents from which one must consider to correct oneself.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	 "First of all, it is necessary to know that phlebotomy must not be administered except for the sake of health and its preservation, and caution against the entry of pain.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	 "And that phlebotomy should be given to three veins which are in a hand, namely the cephalic vein, and the femoral vein, and the basilar vein.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	 "And that phlebotomy should be given at the beginning of fasting and during sleep, as well as after eating; but not afterwards when signs of repletion appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	 "And that phlebotomy should be given on the first or third day after going three hours without eating.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	 "However the phlebotomy given to someone on pain is not determined by a set time; but when it was agreed and necessary for that person to have it, either during the night or day, and at all hours of the day and night.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	 "It is not necessary for children until they reach fourteen years old to have phlebotomy.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	 "A woman must not have phlebotomy before the fourth week or after the seventh week.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	 "A senior (someone aged 60 years and older) must not have phlebotomy.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	 "Therefore if someone decides to have phlebotomy for whatever reason it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines beforehand with a laxative, so as not to draw from them the excess of waste material harmful to the main veins.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	 "The patient is not to be cauterized while eating; i.e., he should not vomit after eating a nauseous substance.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	 The patient was not to receive any treatment with the use of urine.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	 After intercourse, he was to be cauterized with a passion again and again until vomiting, urine, and the flow of the stomach, multiplication of sexual acts, and work, exercise, food, eating, all things that have dissolved the strength from his body or animals.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	 After considering the subtlety of humors before this thing if blood is thick with food and drink or medicine; If possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	 After considering the subtlety of humors before this thing if not prohibited by anything else: or exercise another exercise to make the blood subtle.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	 And put the cauterization of his in the heart on the third day as we said; and conary to make him vomit all the accidents from animals' bodies that day like distress, anger, fear: and with all the body's accidents such as labor and punishment and supererogation and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	 Let him make these present with whom he is accustomed to using from the use of aromas and smells and steam as much as possible.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	 After he sits in the patient's hands who is higher than the phlebotomy of the ear, after that he pulls his arm out and frightens him with his hand twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	 After he stretched the ligament along with correction, then again pulled it once more.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	 And let the heat be tempered because when there is a difference in stricture or by excessive tightness, it prohibits the flow of blood; and also with softening, that too prevents the course of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	 After the stricture is done so that his hands frightens at once with the incision and they are felt by sensation.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	 The phlebotomist takes away the phlebotomy of the patient slowly with a little oil, according to custom.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	 In order to grasp or hold on with his right hand the thumb of left hand upon that vein whose phlebotomy he desires (to prevent it from escaping), but only if this does not cause injury; otherwise a blow must be delivered to the thumb
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	 Because he has taken the vein as if it were a slackened bowstring near to phlebotomy; and on these veins is there fullness of breath (or air); when you place the phlebotomy upon her, she will contract beneath the phlebotomist's hand, and the phlebotomist falls. And should this not occur, then he must deliver another blow to the vein. But if it occurs, immediately it shall be tight, because of that; therefore it is necessary for him who causes the phlebotomy (to do so), in order that he may struggle against all these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	 He released or let go of the phlebotomy.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	 If then the vein is opened by chance from its own fullness (of air), it is beneficial to that one who causes the phlebotomy.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	 And if not, then again another vein must be sought from beneath or above him with a fetter; should the place fail there
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	 If he fails, either by accident or because of weakness, then let him abandon his task on that day; or in two days more. And do not bind the ligature.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	 Fearful indeed is it if the vein should be taken away by frost.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	 Nor shall he enter the chamber of air; that is, the skin pores or venules.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	 He will try again if he desires phlebotomy.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	 If the opening is small or the blood flows gently (that is, the quantity of blood drawn must be within certain limits), he will try again from this same vein and on the next day at least; add to his work as little as possible.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	 And do this with a fetter before the place is opened; for a place must often be sought from phlebotomies that are very poor and many times by different men when phlebotomizing.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	 If indeed you have found him who has already been phlebotomized (that is, he should not be phlebotomized again), do not try to go over and above him in any way; for this cannot excuse anything on your part.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	 Using olive oil from above puts something on top of it because it cleanses/cleanses blood flow
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	 The use of olive oil is better here than any other kind of oil and the rest as well
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	 In all veins of yours where the veins run through, they apply olive oil to remove iron stains and make them bright again, and when it is placed on one spot
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	 The blood becomes thinner and lighter as time passes when it's thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	 If you apply it to a large spot where the veins run close together, and this happens repeatedly especially for those who are not phlebotomists except using that one way opening/pathway, then you put a sponge soaked in water and salt into the spot immediately: you heat it up with warm water as well. And after a while tie it down with a string: because it becomes thinner.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	 It is necessary that you do this after the blood has left using your own thing and adding something else, or from another source
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	 If after a few days something is left behind in the spot or urine, do not worry, just put something on top of it like aloe or myrrh sellers' extracts, or from mint extract, i.e., burning with warmth and similar things.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	 Many people get stains in the veins of the basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	 Therefore you should place your hand on top of it and if there is a lump above that spot press down on the clump: then that stain becomes bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	 And so to put something on top of it from what we said earlier.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	 There is no blood in the arteries due to that.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	 But if you put a lump on him where there was stiffness before it will become loose/loose up.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 After this care for him with the rest of your cure until he is healed
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	 You have to remove all the blood from everyone according to their strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	 And what appears in a bright color on top of the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	 If the skin is black, it must be removed immediately; if the skin is white, then remove him (the patient) with a razor blade gently and carefully to ensure smoothness of the skin
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	 The skin must be extracted with a single razor blade if he is full and strong; to increase the blood flow of one's body and make it straight forwardly; but for those who are weak, then extract him using an opposite razor blade in order that they may be stronger
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	 The skin must be extracted with the help of veins if he is in a state of thirst; to ensure that it will become narrow and tight: better than any other way because administering blood flow works much better than making a cut or piercing.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	 The mode of phlebotomy is safe due to the flow of blood; and from the incision of nerves; it's better than any other way because administering a blood flow works much better than through width or length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	 If the man preferred to drink while phlebotomy is performed at random intervals; then he must drink before phlebotomy occurs with a moderate amount of warm water which will cause him to sweat; but if the man becomes hot during the process; then extract blood from his veins by three or four of them.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	 If the man's face is burned; then he will take before phlebotomy a piece of food which has been infused with honey of my kind or with honey mixed with aromatic spices or with honey mixed with an unpleasant smell.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	 If it is preferred to drink before phlebotomy at random intervals and if there will be a loss of blood as a result; then take water with the help of meat and scented syrup: so that you will breathe through your nostrils, make yourself thin and make a groove for his mouth in order to do this.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	 If someone prefers to amputate their arm and drink the blood of them quickly; then take the phlebotomy of him who is due to a great deal of evacuation because his power is weak so that he drinks it gradually by the amount of strength in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	 "When he is about to amputate the arm and cleanse its blood with the second lancet, it becomes strong; then let him perform this operation within seven hours or eight days at his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	 "Whoever is about to draw blood from the other side of his body towards him; he must allow himself to be drawn on the second day or at most three days.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	 "In a person whose body has much blood and is heated up; he sweats and brings on fever. It must be done that some blood be drawn out from him in one vessel, and of quantity many. And the opening may be made as wide as it wants to accid until you are accustomed to all the conditions of phlebotomy: and when your hand is placed upon his chest at the descent of the blood so that it does not fall at once.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	 "Indeed, many times it occurs when the phlebotomist does not know how to do his work and is careless.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	 "It is not to be done when one has already cleaned the arm and cleanses its blood with the second lancet; since at that time the opening of the vein will become hard, so that it may cause death prematurely or very quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	 "This operation is a bad thing to do; therefore abandon it unless you are second phlebotomist.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	 "Or else remove the thing that has coagulated from within the opening of the vein and place upon it something dissolved in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	 "Or else place on top of that something from a sponge or a towel; and press it lightly until the blood flows.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	 "If already the thumb is used up, then let go of that one immediately; and do not press it tightly until it stops bleeding.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	 "If a necessity arises to draw the second blood; and there is no excuse for it, then either place him on top of that one or another arm at once.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	 "The veins of the forearm are phlebotomized on the Fossa and the Basilica; since they do not penetrate or are occluded because they have been made from them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	 The quality of its bloodletting is such that a sick person puts their hand into warm water and holds it until the wound bleeds brightly and clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	 Then, gently but firmly, it is bound with medium tightness to its surface.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	 Next the bloodletting is performed gradually and sideways, neither longitudinally nor transversely; with a wide opening to avoid pain during bloodletting, and with your phlebotomy tool as you connect it to the hand higher up.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	 If the loss of blood is forbidden by death or other circumstances, then put your hand into warm water and release the blood to run freely; until you need its removal.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	 If however you are in a state of illness or old age, then you may excuse yourself from further hand use in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	 And most importantly, the course of bloodletting is performed in hot water for as long as it takes to achieve its purpose.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	 The first tool of this kind is superior to all others because it is not dull or heavy in use, and does not tire the hand.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	 The right hand's bloodletting tool is a gift to those who are left-handed, as it is designed to help them more easily perform the procedure.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	 The quality of its bloodletting is such that you gently but firmly bind your hand with a cord or your own hand after putting it into warm water until the wound bleeds clearly and strongly to the eye.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	 Then the bloodletting is performed by moving it across the surface.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	 If you are too weak to perform the bloodletting entirely yourself, do not let it harm that particular thing at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	 And continue using your hand with the tool until its purpose is complete and the wound has stopped bleeding brightly and clearly to the eye.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	 The veins of the hand are removed from the flesh by it, as a preparation for bloodletting.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	 Then put your hand into warm water and release the blood to run freely within that same water until you need its removal.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	 But if you do not put your hand into warm water for this purpose, the blood will coagulate within the wound and prevent further bleeding.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	 When you take out a certain amount of blood due to necessity, then place over that one oil and salt so as not to be lost or damaged
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	 And similarly, when doing with every branch tightly
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	 From the left hand you take away from blood vessels of necessity; for this is connected to the spleen with veins: and similarly do when doing in phlebotomy that one, as you did it equally on the second
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	 The phlebotomist takes away the blood vessels of necessity; for this is connected to the spleen with veins: and similarly do when doing in phlebotomy that one, as you did it equally on the second
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	 The quality of phlebotomy is such that the phlebotomist introduces an exhausted foot into a warm bath and applies friction above it so as to make them go away: and binds above the joint of the leg with correction.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	 Certainly there is a place at the heel, visible to the foot; and they are drawn out from it on both sides of the leg.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	 So that phlebotomy is done with more branch and at the heel together; for it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	 If the phlebotomist does that on the face of the foot then squeeze from beneath those above with the hand to the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	 You put your phlebotomy as that you will strike her; and there is a phlebotomist Nesius.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	 If the exit of blood is prohibited then on another foot put his into a warm bath; and let him drain the blood flowing to that one until they are done.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	 You put one phlebotomist into the first bath; then he does with phlebotomy to the upper ones because there is safety and not danger from him when you drive away in correction as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	 And similarly, with one foot of another equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 The place for sciatica is as we said at the heel from the side; it is extended downwardly.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	 The veins of phlebotomy are painful when they are caused by cold blood
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	 The quality of phlebotomy is such that it becomes weakened by the touch of cold water, and tingles; and to stretch from one heel anchor up to the top of the calcaneum with four fingers, using a long thin needle; for it does not seem until then.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	 When therefore it seems, then the phlebotomy can be done according to whatever ingenuity you have, or through a transfer; and it is better either to strike with an incision, or to cut off by section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	 The location of him is hidden among many people
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	 If you are unable to see him when he is not hidden among many people; then the phlebotomy must be done by someone else's hand on their back and over their ear as well; and then draw out from their blood in proportion to how much it flows.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	 After this restriction, put the place of phlebotomy on the skin carefully, and stretch that spot.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	 Then it is healed.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	 About venipuncture, its use
Caput XCVIII.	 Chapter Eighty-Eight
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	 They are inserted from the arm and from under the ear and from above.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	 Venipuncture can be done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	 With a scratch and the extraction of blood; and another way is venipuncture without a scratch.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	 This way that does not use a scratch is done in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	 Or else it can be with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	 Or without the use of fire
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	 The places where venipuncture is done with a scratch and extraction of blood are thirteen in number.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	 The venipuncture that is done at the back of the head is called Alnocrati; and it's below the chin; and the one above the ears, there are two flaps on each side; and in between the eyes, it's under the jaw; and over both elbows, and they are middle to both arms; and above both knees.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	 A venesection without removing any blood from the vessels by punctures on your skin, and because of this, his virtue did not descend into these, just as it is with venepuncture
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	 It should not be administered if you use fire or without fire when there is some sort of astringent that comes from squeezing; until the entire body is drained off completely
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	 If there is a need for venesection due to astringency or customarily so, we administer it at any time from the beginning of menstruation until the end and throughout this period as well as whenever that may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	 This is because from men it happens that when the blood is multiplied in him, until he becomes extracted by venesection of his, with a head injury occurred and death occurs.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	 And from these it happens that the face had redness and bleeding on its own head, and its neck as well.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	 And from these it happens that the face had itching on his face, forehead, darkness and blindness of the eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	 And from these it is that the place for venesection was located.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	 And from these, its blood is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	 And from these it happens that the taste of his blood was entered into his mouth; either he spits out the tongue or he ejects the blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	 And from these, its sleep is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	 And from these, he sees his blood and bleeding, and the destruction of it, and those things are similar to this.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	 Therefore when we need something from these and if it is at the third period of menstruation; then venesection must be done now, after two or three hours have passed.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	 The venesection of the nape is as follows; because this one causes bleeding on the head and it also goes into the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	 And it should be that after the removal of all body parts are done.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	 This is a translation of "this spot is for removing blood from the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	 And if it's too cold to make use of that location when there is mucus present as well.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	 He gets a large amount of bleeding.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	 And because of this, it's not advisable to use that location if the head is cold and the person has cold sores on their scalp.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	 If someone stays in proximity with the same face for a long time, it can lead to an injury on that side of the head.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	 And because of this, it's advisable to remove the hand that is in close proximity with the face as soon as possible and move it downward to avoid injury from the side of the head caused by an overly close grasp.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	 The use of the Ventosator or the Alkehel is for removing blood from the veins and the arteries, while the use of the Phlebotomia Basilica is used when there are constrictions in the veins; it's also recommended to avoid tools like a fist as they can cause injuries.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	 It's advisable to push the Venosator with the Alkehel downward if it is placed on the inferior part of the body as this can cause weakness and dizziness.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	 The use of the Venosator or Alhagdaghim causes accidents on the head and eyes as well as stomach pains; it can also cause perforations in the roots and pain in the teeth.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 It's advisable to remove the Venosator quickly lest you cause injury by crushing a blood vessel and stop its flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	 The use of the Venosator under the tongue causes issues with saliva in the mouth as well as with dental hygiene and other similar injuries that may occur from sores or blisters on the lips; it's also advisable to have an alternative location for phlebotomy near both ears where they can be used.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	 The use of spatulas causes issues with the face and cold temperatures as well as redness on the skin around it; using spatulas is not advisable for phlebotomy purposes.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	 The use of phlebotomia on the inside of the two thighs and three veins (the Basilica, the veins, and the head) is used to pull blood out quickly from all those places in quick succession; after this they draw minute amounts of blood through larger veins until a full amount of blood has been drawn.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	 And it is necessary that the Ventosiator not proceed too far with his excision; for although the place where he operates has been stripped of flesh and under it there are veins and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	 And a vein that extends above the anus is called an ani (hemorrhoid).
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	 And it is necessary that the Ventosiator proceed only slightly with his excision; for the place where he operates is quite thin and easily torn by a strong force, and there may be serious damage to delicate veins if excessive excision occurs.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	 The veins are cut with great diminution; for they draw blood from all over the body and cause severe pain in the arms, legs, neck, face (nose), and abdomen; causing menstruation to occur early as well as causing bothor (an abscess near an anal fistula).
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	 However, they weaken the body much and cause death in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	 The abscess near the anal fistula is very close to that of the veins' excisions.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	 The quality of the Venosiator's position is as follows: first you should open and heat the veins gently; do not prolong this position too long but rather quickly remove them or move them back to their original location, so that the spirits coming from there will be equal (in terms of quantity) with those going in. Do not repeat this act until the place becomes red and swollen; then you should make a significant excision followed by frequent excisions.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	 Then consider the disposition of the body.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	 For one who is thin and delicate should be operated on only once; so that he won't get an ulcer.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	 And the Venosiator should proceed with excision by increasing its severity and depth; but he must heat up the vein gently so that it is easily removed or moved back into position using a gentle grip on the vein while pulling out slowly.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	 If there is much blood in the veins, then you should operate on him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	 In very subtle incision of blood, and its opening; And in the second indeed most exquisite purifications of great amount of blood
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	 If the blood is foul tasting, then let there be a third incision; so that it may bring about an end to things.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	 And when we wish to quickly or more rapidly draw out the blood, one incision is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	 If we want multiple purifications of great quantity of blood, then let there be an incision with many incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	 And if we measure the blood to be thick, then let there be an incision with deep purifications; and when it comes to a certain depth of purification, it is necessary that the incision has reached its end, because the depth of the skin cuts off.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	 What should be administered from oils at the position of the ventricles; and what should be tasted?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	 To one whose skin is thick and hard and narrow pores; it is necessary that the areas of the ventricles be rubbed with oils in a gentle way, soft, fast. If this is done during the time of eating, then let olive oil mixed with honey or with oil from the tonsils be tasted gently.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	 And if this is done during the time of drinking; then let nectar or wine be tasted mixed with honey or with oil from lilies and rosemary, just like these others.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	 If the oil is too thick and cold; then let bitter oil or wine from balsam be tasted mixed with honey or with oil from aloes, just like these others.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	 If the oil being tasted is of great quantity and very tender; then it is necessary that there be prevented from using an oil to rub with, and afterwards to rinse the areas of the ventricles gently with rose water or cold water or sun-warmed water or water from cucurbits, or water from purslane.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	 That one whose blood is of much moisture, will be able to rub the oils gently with vinegar or water from myrtle and honey; just like these others.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	 "When the excess of bile becomes thick and heavy, it should be treated with wine or old vinegar, or by decoction of senna (a powdered laxative), or with a mixture of these.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	 "And it should also be treated by vomiting with vinegar or senna powder, or given after exiting the bath to cool and then again after a certain interval (two hours).
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	 "Nor is it desirable that anyone fall asleep immediately after emesis.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	 "What should be done to regulate the vomiting, or to stop bleeding before vomiting?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	 "After this should be considered first, whether the vomiting is choleric (due to bad blood and inflammation) or phlegmatic (due to cold and dampness), in order to stop the bleeding and inflammation, one must apply cold remedies such as vinegar, lettuce, etc., just like powdered mustard. And also for epilepsy with vinegar, lettuce, and other similar remedies.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	 "And afterwards the vomiting should be treated by eating food that is light on stomach, such as eggs or lean meat, and then with astringent drinks, just like those mentioned before.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	 "And to the one who has a cold stomach should drink syrups made from honey or almonds, or those made with the bark of asclepias (a plant), and also with aromatic wine which is in between old and new, so that he may eat sparingly.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	 "And afterwards the vomiting should be treated by eating food that is light on stomach, such as eggs or lean meat, and then with bitter drinks (which were mentioned before), just like those made from Columb's flowers.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	 "It is also desirable that the amount of drinking after vomiting and bleeding should be more than food, so as to prevent swelling in the hands and feet, or medicines made from sea-bass (fish), namely muscaria or alesselith before vomiting, and before bleeding, or afterwards, so as to soothe and thin blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	 "It is not desirable that they should be warmed with hot drink after vomiting.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	 Without scarification
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	 The veins that are without scarification when placed upon the ear, and wiped with a sponge, and poulticed (pressed) in, and near the navel, and over the root of the finger, and places on the face; because these members did not endure scarification at all above themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	 They are not sought through them unless a touch from the member of blood to the body is made; thus we placed the vein upon the breasts during menstruation, and flow of blood into the navel
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	 We put them on so that we might pour upon them cold and dampness from the member; thus we placed the veins over the navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	 Indeed it makes the member more slack and releases the cold, but disperses the pain because it has resolved this wetness.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	 They are placed upon the veins when they occur due to a poultice, or stone
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	 The force of its attraction opens up the hair growth (poultice), or removes the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	 And similarly when placed upon the ear and wiped with a sponge during wetness it does both of these things.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	 The veins of Venus are administered with water accompanied by a single cut (poultice).
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	 And sometimes when they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	 And sometimes when they are administered with hot water during menstruation; and that is how the vein is made big or small, it can be either hot water alone (such as heated herbs), or water mixed with heated herbs.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	 The administration of the veins of Venus with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	 The size of the opening through which it goes into and comes out is determined by how we formed it; its quantity in depth should be half an inch long; and in the side where it is located (near the middle), a small hole must be made, so that there will not be pain at its place upon itself. And also for passing from above to below through this vein, either by air or iron, when it is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	 "Now it is a large vessel which has been opened up, greater than what we could expect and less only than that one; according to the skill and age of him who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	 "The vessels of children are different from those used by youths; they are thinner than those used by men and larger than those used by the elderly.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	 "The quality of opening this vessel with fire is to make an incision on the skin more accurately or to light a small flame from a wick; and place it over a medium-sized flame that should be at the center of use in order to adjust the heat of the fire so as not to burn the body if it's used poorly.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	 "Then place it over the skin; and put your finger above the opening that I mentioned until we hold the vessel in our hands; when we touch it, we withdraw our finger and it goes out of the opening quickly.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	 "Afterwards, apply the flame according to its own nature, and repeat her if she becomes inflamed.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	 "The vessel used for urine administration with water is not a urethral one; and it's not administered unless water is applied to it and placed over the skin.
Et haec est forma eius.	 "And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	 "The bladder (ventosa) used for large quantities of water is larger and better than the one used for smaller amounts.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	 Suspension of blood vessels
Caput XCIX.	 Chapter 90.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	 "Blood vessels are not administered with many of them, except when the position of the openings is impossible for them due to their small size, like the lips and tongue.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	 "Or by removing the member from the flesh as if it were a finger or nose, and similar things are done to them.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	 "The quality of using these is that the veins from blood vessels in water will be sweet and those from rotten water are bitter.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	 "They then are removed at daybreak and bedtime in sweet waters until they become weak, but nothing remains in their veins.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	 The body must first be evacuated with phlebotomy and followed by the use of a pessary
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	 Next remove the skin from the limb until it is numb
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	 They are placed over the top
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	 Once it is applied and removed, if there was no success then the mouth must be washed with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	 Afterwards much water is used to wash away any remaining blood
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	 If the flow of blood continues after a cut to the vein, then you must apply a cold compress over it and remove any residual blood.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If the bleeding increases then apply pressure with a tourniquet or use glass splints and do so until the bleeding has stopped.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	 Or place weights over the wound to press it down and remove them when the cloth remains stuck on the site until the bleeding has stopped.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	 If a change of tourniquet is needed then replace it if possible.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	 If the bleeding cannot be stopped with a tourniquet or other means, then wash away any recent blood from that site.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	 Or if there is something coming out of the wound at this point, wash it immediately to prevent infection.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	 Afterwards they are removed when they sense anything coming from the blood so that they can be removed promptly.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	 When it is time to stop bleeding then apply pressure over them with something like a tourniquet or salt and let them fall immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	 The end of the second part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	 Chapter 3 of the book on surgery by Albucasis.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	 A general talk about restoring, dislocating and twisting wounds and similar topics.
Caput I.	 Part 1
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	 This chapter is also very important for the practice of medicine and includes healing fractures, dislocations in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	 Beware sons of mine because many doctors and wise men have learned from this chapter which was never read by the ancients nor has ever been written down in their books.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	 For this reason a mode is suitable for us as it has been introduced by scholars into our territory
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	 I never used it and was not proficient in it; however, after reading many ancient books and studying hard with their scholars, I acquired the knowledge from them
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	 Then, through experimentation and study, I gradually gained proficiency in that mode.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	 I have described to you everything that my knowledge contained; and after the completion of my experiment, which I had shown to you before, I handed it over to you through the occupation of elongation [the act of making longer], and afterwards shortened it through the act of abbreviation [the act of making shorter]. And I showed you how I formed many forms from the shapes used in that mode, when added with declination; just as I had done in two previous chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	 In summary and collections from the breakage of bones; before we begin with the remembrance of fractured members, and others; if anyone's.
Caput II.	 Chapter 2
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	 It is fitting that we speak at the beginning of this chapter on eloquence, and sums of sermons; as well as chapters which are addressed to those who are first taught in this noble craft: namely you, and the prompt ones among them; so they may know or learn how to practice this noble art with their own abilities.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	 I say that when a fracture or dislocation occurs to him; then it is fitting to seek out the first-aiders who are in proximity by his side at the time of this accident: to bleed and drain him if possible, as well as give him two waters separately, unless any prohibition is given. If it concerns an infant from those who are young, or a decrepit old man; or because of excessive heat or cold that has affected him.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	 After that there is a need for food of his own; and cold drinks, and fat foods; and drink prohibition [of alcohol]; and large amounts of meat; as well as replenishing with blood, from any available food.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	 "When you are completely secure in your operation and the material to the member has not been affected by fluid effusion; then it will be healed through its own natural course, according to his custom.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	 "If the mouth is broken and needs to be restored, then it should receive much nourishment from foods rich in oil, salt, vinegar, which are beneficial for soothing its dryness; as if meals were cooked with water, wine, and cheese, bread, fish, eggs, cheese, and butter, until one feels satisfied.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	 "With this regimen the healing of a fracture will be better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	 "You know that bones broken when they are in the first youth or old age and weakness cannot continue to be maintained and consoled according to their nature forever due to the dehydration of their members; but they will be strengthened and continued as if they were those of a child.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 "However nature has attached something similar to the mouth broken from all parts which contains thickness so that it remains and tightens itself until they return to their original firmness; as if meals were cooked with water, wine, cheese, bread, fish, eggs, cheese, butter, etc., due to this cause we must feed the patient food rich in fat and dryness.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	 "You know that the species of fractures are different according to the diversity of members; for example, a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head or chest or back bones; and similarly all other limbs also have their own unique species. And I come with the remembrance of every kind of fracture being presented in its separate chapter.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	 "The species of fractures within themselves are different as well.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	 "Because it is a broken fracture over the stars.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	 "And sometimes there was a fracture of his bones according to their length; and the fractures were due to blows or kicks from fists or feet; that is, stars [that is, bruises] and additional scratches resulting, as are found on a comb when it is used for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	 "And not due to kicks or blows from the head; and there was also a fracture due to striking with an elbow, or fracturing of any kind.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	 "And all the art and skill that is necessary to restore him, according to which he cannot remember [the restoration procedure], must be clearly specified in his places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	 "From that [procedure for restoring a fracture] by which one knows how to treat fractures of bones; there is the tortuosity of his case, and its prominence; and an appearance of it on his sense [i.e., where he can feel the pain]; and also a sound from him when you compress him with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	 "Therefore if there is no tortuosity in the place to be treated [i.e., where you can feel his pain], neither a sound from your touch with fingers or agitation; nor did he have much pain when you compressed him, then it was not that fracture but rather perhaps there was tortuosity of bone, or a little fissure.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 "You know that if it curves and splits into two parts, except for the blows or kicks from fists or feet; but all the rest of its parts are to be released by you.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	 "If you hit him with a cold spit [i.e., apply ice], then release him in several days until he is quiet.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	 "Then restore him according to whatever way of gentleness and skill you can.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	 "You know that the restoration [of his bones] and its matching is easier than with them where blows occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	 "Then restore him according to what you do not remember from him.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	 The member being fractured must be extended with two parts by means of the hand if it is a hand, or through the foot if it is a leg; and either with your own hand if the member itself is intact (i.e., not fractured), or else with two pieces, or with two hands working together to extend the part that has been divided into two pieces.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	 Place your hand or foot firmly on the member that has been divided into two pieces in a manner consistent with its natural shape until both parts are extended: then, using all of your strength and skill, you will pull these additions toward each other in any way you can manage within those boundaries; moreover, apply one bone from among your pair to your colleague's so as to achieve the best result.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	 When the time comes and you are able to grasp it with both hands.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	 If therefore something different should occur there, correct it according to the measure of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	 With utmost extension and strongest compression, as many strong men do; so too you must extend this member.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	 For many a time they strike with their hand or foot to the same degree of coldness and compression; thus we see it from their operations too often.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	 Afterwards apply the joint to its proper place, and perform the necessary cut and cutting motion; then firmly hold it with your hands or foot while making a tight grip on its member, and relax and soothe it until its firmness is restored; and gently draw the weak one over onto itself as well.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	 And hold tight to it so that it may not slip in the time of your strongest blows; and sleep on its restoration to you, and your agitation, and under your own ejection, using all of your strength at last.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	 And that so it may not be in a position with the pain where it follows, but rather you will hold it securely in hand or foot.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	 This is because when it feels the positions of its member painful or injury-causing then you must move it to another place that does not feel pain or hurt in order to continue with your work.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	 "If he lies down on it such that its position is equal to his own, straight; so that it does not get tangled up with any twists when restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	 The quality of the fractured member's structure.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	 Alas, when broken members differ in size and shape from one another, and their magnitude.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	 Therefore let it be wrapped with soft, tender clothes so that the fingers do not get tangled up when they are restored.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	 However if one or more of them is large as a thigh or an arm, let it be wrapped with broad, strong clothes so that the fingers do not get tangled up when they are restored.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	 Since the long sinew has connected the large member and held it tight from all parts equally so that no part could become injured through its connection with another.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	 After you had removed the bandage from his position and placed it on the spot of the fracture with gentle touch
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	 Then begin wrapping the sinew around that part of his fracture with three or four movements so as to hold it and your hand together more firmly with the ligament
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	 Then turn around and wrap him over to the upper part of his fracture and hold it with less force than before so that you may have restored the broken place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	 Then stretch out with him wrapped around as before and make it soft gently until you have restored the large part of his body to health.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	 Then take another bandage and wrap it around again so that he may be wrapped up with bandages on either side of the broken place
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	 Then turn around and wrap him over to lower part of his fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	 The operation of your bandage should be with wrapping it gently and making him soft just as we have said before for the upper part of his body.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	 Then put between the bandages or some other cloth with which you can equalize the twists of his fracture if there are any; otherwise do not put anything on it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	 "Another wound after this one.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	 After the wounds have been treated equally and quickly as possible, if there is no swelling at the wound site or inflammation caused by frostbite (neither of which are present), apply cold water for cooling and numbing effect.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	 If there is swelling or frostbite (neither of which are present), then apply something to reduce the swelling and apply cold water for numbing effect afterward. If it does not help within a few days, remove it.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	 "After another wound...
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	 The wounds should be dressed evenly and skillfully according to their type - either with gauze strips from bandages, or with wood where there are no other materials available; the strips of cloth must fit tightly around each wound so that all wounds have equal fullness and shape as they need it.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	 However, it is necessary that the bandage placed over this treated wound should be larger and wider than all other wounds - its length should match to some extent with the size of both hands taken together in terms of their respective lengths and widths.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	 "After another wound...
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	 After another wound, tie it with the same bandage as before and securely - its tightness should be greater than the tightness of any other bandage after this first one; if there is more length to the fracture then there will also be more length added by tight bandage, but less width (stricture) lost.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	 The middle strip should have equal fullness and subtlety while being soft from linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	 If the strips are thick, like those tied by strong stitches of linen cords that were twisted in making them - such an error is great, because when these strips come off it loses its fullness and quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	 The middle strip will not match the second time - this is because you cannot adjust their tightness with these strips as they were before.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	 It should not be less than one finger's width between all wounds.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	 If a limb is injured after dressing the wounds and there was some slipping out of bandage from one or both hands - then apply something soft, like linen cloth for example, to keep it on until nothing more falls off.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	 When a fracture occurs with an injury and disruption of the cut, I recall [the necessary steps] according to my experience
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	 You also know that every member fractured must be treated right away with splints on the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	 This is because when the member is large it's not advisable to put a splint on top of them unless at least 5 days have passed or up to 7 if you prefer for safety reasons and you want to ensure that they are warmed up properly after removing the splint.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	 And this is how splints were used by earlier practitioners who placed them on top of fractures and dislocations.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	 The common method of splinting is to place them on multiple occasions over a period of time, especially for women and children because it helps prevent heat or cold from getting onto the area that was injured.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	 And it is important to ensure that the splint is not too tight and that there are no sharp edges where you can hit your skin when moving the arm or leg; this means making sure to use a soft splint that won't cause harm even if someone accidentally bumps into it, ensuring it fits well without being so loose as to slip off easily.
Deinde utere eo.	 Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	 Another way of splinting is for fractures, dislocations and twists/sprains.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	 First add aloe vera and marshmallow root; then add a mixture of laurel leaves, mugwort and enulae; next add sugar mixed with myrrh of various kinds to flavour it; after that mix in the juice from aloes with water; or use almond oil if the splinting is too hot.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	 Then use this splint.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	 This splint is good for restoring broken bones and making people sit up again after being laid down
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	 Another way of splinting that also covers fractures and twists.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	 First mix aloe vera and marshmallow root; then add a mixture of laurel leaves, mugwort and enulae; next add sugar mixed with myrrh in various kinds to flavor it; after that mix the juice from aloes with water or use almond oil if needed; finally administer this splint for use.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	 modus for cutting and separating bones, from their places they are; to heal the pain caused by accidents with a bone saw, and fractures
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	 Burn the wool that has been spoiled (damaged), and immerse it in vinegar; then make a decoction of olive oil to put over the place
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	 The bone saw (emplastron) is not useful for restoring health, but it's a good thing in soothing the heated pains; and it will expel pain truly
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	 The modus for setting bones
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	 Burn the spoiled wool; and burn the wool of the sheep-shearer, with both; everything else, make an implastron from it.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	 The modus for abbreviating the bone saw and administering to the healing of fractures in bones; when you are left with a resolution after the soothing.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	 Recipe for the high roots and chamomile; and flowers of the violet, and saffron herb; from all things one share is taken away; then everything else, they are made to be mixed with wine if there is not a heated membrane
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	 If the membrane is overheated, then mix it with humid water or just with water and eat it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	 Another modus for the bone saw (emplastron), stronger than this first one; when a heated pain is caused by an accident at the time of healing of members.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	 Recipe for the high roots and semen lilies, and balsam of Gilead, and mallow leaves; from all things one share is taken away; then everything else, they are made to be mixed with salt water or sweet water or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	 Everything this (the implastron) according to the heat of the members and his calm heat is done.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	 Hippocrates said nothing in his book (the Corpus of Medicine) that a bone saw should be put on the broken member for healing, except for cauterization made from coal and oil; nothing else was written; but he instructed, so it might serve as an intermediary between grossness and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 "However it should be noted that when there is a fracture near the restoration of the part, as with myrrh and aloes wood, they too need to be applied.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	 The manner in which plasters are used for healing and relieving pain
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	 This recipe includes myrrh, and rue, hairs of the human body including finger and toe nails, salt, and others; they are to be applied, rubbed in, and mixed together into a plaster for healing purposes.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	 The quantity according to which it is appropriate so that the ligature can be maintained, then loosened up, and is thus considered when it does not happen from a weak pain or itchiness; it is not resolved for several days unless he happens to be injured in his mouth.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	 If there is a itchiness or pain that occurs at the time of application; then apply immediately, and loosen it up when necessary with a warm cloth soaked in water.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	 After this let the member rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	 After this apply a hot cloth soaked with vinegar and oil or with olive oil to it at night; let one ligature be applied over the member during the night so that it is warmed up by another ligature in a warm bath; then the swelling will cease, and the pain of him who has been injured.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	 After this apply a small ligature; and do not tighten with your own constriction first, but gradually ease into it so that he is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	 If you are aware of any pain or swelling that occurred before the application, then apply another ligature and tighten just as you did initially.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	 If nothing else occurred to the member from what we mentioned above; then do not reapply it unless three days or four days or five days or seven days have passed.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	 When one day of fasting has passed and you have been able to eat until the members are restored as we advised, unless a fracture occurs while eating or during drinking and it is necessary for coagulation of the flesh above that: add also then in stricture more than your first stricture completely; and also add in the swelling of food to some extent according to what preceded his recollection.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	 If you know that the place for fracture has already been prepared and it is necessary to add more than was advised before a fracture occurs; then remember that nutrition must be forbidden from being brought in there.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	 Therefore, let him be immersed with hot water around all the vessels where he is present and may this last for three days, and pray for a more severe stricture.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	 Therefore, let it follow [the operation] to the member of nutrition either to be healed or later on.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	 However those who restore a member after fracture of the vessels by drinking another way when it is not restored initially as advised, according to what they must do and are restored according to tortuosity: this error from their operation and great fear; if there was a rectum, these were recorded in their books, and performed with him.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	 And I did not see any of their question in that one, but I thought it was right so that this would not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	 Of the fracture in the head
Caput III.	 The third skull
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	 Fractures are of different kinds and shapes; their causes are distinguished from them.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	 Of the fracture that occurs from impact with a blow; and the blow produces a complete wound up to the nose as far as it goes under the bone just like an axe strikes wood, so this is called these types of fractures Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	 Or a blow to some bone strikes the face of it and does not penetrate down until its extreme; this is called these types of fractures Kalakian, that is, the complete fracture.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	 "The wound is either large and deep, or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	 "Also from the fracture is known as the extent of it; whether it is a cut or tear, and the reason for this is striking with stone.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	 "This fracture is also known as one that penetrates and becomes a tear, which occurs under bone; or on the face of bones; it's either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	 "Also from the fracture is known as one that occurs in the bone with subtlety of a hair; and it's called this kind of fracture 'species fracturae Capillarise'.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	 "Also from that is a fracture, which occurs by the strike of stone, and they are similar to those who enter into the bone in order to reach the inside; so that it happens at once; just as when a blow falls upon them by the force of air, and a part of theirs enters into the inside.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	 "Indeed, that is it most certainly in the hands of the bones of the children; just as are the heads of the children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	 "There will be for all these species of fractures a separate category and I'll be with the memory of that whole one into his place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	 "We all know these species of fractures through the observation on her and the examination of them with their strings, and the removal of the corrupted tools which are above them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	 "The species 'Capillarise' is known through this; it is detected above the nose and removed, and it is polished above him with soot; for indeed a black fracture appears.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	 "In the treatment of fractures, consider first and foremost the accidents to him; if you see from the accidents what is clearly apparent above fear; just as a man's cholera and extension, and mis-take intellects, and cut off their voices, and syncopia, and acute fever, and egress of eyes, and reddening of them; and similar things from accidents in many dispositions, not healing afar away: and if you see that there is no accident causing to you, and hope for salvation, then begin the treatment of him.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	 When a wound is first opened up and starts bleeding, you need to study the abcess with great care every six days until it heals completely
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	 And if the abscess is formed on a day when we are sick, then you must remove the pus before it becomes corrupted under the bone and any accidents which happen to us should be treated separately
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	 If a bone is broken and has reached the skin, you need to attack it with a knife, remove any loose or attached parts separately.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	 And you should remove the head of the ulcer by any method that is possible for you, and in accordance with its shape, and what is above a sick person.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	 If an abscess occurs as a result of a blood clot or cold frostbite on your bones, then apply something appropriate to it immediately.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	 And if the abscess is caused by putting fat on the ulcer and hot oil, then let it rest until the frostbite has subsided and there are no more bleeding issues.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	 Then begin with the treatment of the bone and the removal of the abscess.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	 This will be done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	 The first way is to cut off the bone with a very sharp knife and remove it from there.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	 Another method after removing the bones closer to that location, which will leave an incision as its shape.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	 And then you should apply another knife further away and also according to it.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	 The second way is to have a different number of incisors next to you and some are wider than others, while some are smaller, all of them should be sharp enough that they can cut through flesh easily, but not the head, so it can remove the bone cleanly without cutting into it too much.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	 If the bone is very hard to cut through, you should first make an incision around it before applying the knife with a different name for incisors which do not penetrate deep: and these ones are not called so unless they reach all the way up to that thing under its head, because the Terebra has a round tip above that part of its head in a shape similar to a circle but cannot submerge into flesh or pierce through it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	 To you it was granted that you might receive from these Terebris a great number of them each one of which by cutting into the quantity of spit bones should come to be present for you all Crane of Terebrum: whose extremity and acute quantity in length and breadth is according to the amount of spit bones of those cranes.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	 And this is the form of three holes of Terebrums or Trepanos
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	 The quality of perforating into the broken bone is this: that you put a Terebrum upon your mouth and keep on pulling it with your fingers until you know that your mouth has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	 Then exchange the Terebrum for another place and put something which is between every hole in the quantity of the breadth of the radius or around that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	 Then strike with the Incisors what is between every hole out of bone and do that subtly as you can above it from the limit of breadth or around that like we said until you open your mouth either by your hand or by another instrument which you have put to this: just like the teeth, and the small holes.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	 It is necessary that you use every caution not to touch the Terebrum or Incisor anything from the sheaths.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	 When you have finished with the perforating and separated from the sheath if it was continuous with that and removed him you must know how to pull off his remaining part of the bone with another instrument like an Incisor.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	 Nevertheless, be sure to have them thin and subtle more than others' Incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	 If there is something left from the bones by a little bit and the teeth you take that with ease along with what is at your place from instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	 Afterwards take care of the wound after this with linctuses and ointments which we have spoken about.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	 Another method of surgery is easy to do but it has the fear associated with it because what said Galen and was praised by him greatly: this is his saying.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	 First of all, you must detach the broken part from its place using your fingers or some other instrument to isolate it; then after having isolated this part and placed it under that end (of the lens) of the incision on the hand holding the fingers, you will have made a complete detachment with precision.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	 The lens part itself is not cut: but the sharp edge of it, facing outwards and directed to both sides of its width as you see fit, will be placed with a blunt end against the object it strikes acutely.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	 Then, when you have detached the broken part and placed it under that end of the incision on your hand holding the fingers, you will make a complete detachment with ease; so to say, by means of a small blow against this very incision made gently without contact or touch of any kind upon the object which strikes violently: but striking back quickly after it has struck.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	 And if the physician were a more skilled man and knew it well, he would not be sleeping; but then staying in such place with his finger or some other instrument, when he has detached that part and placed it under that end of the incision on your hand holding the fingers, you will have made an easy detachment from him as easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	 It will be released without any trouble or fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	 But if the fracture of your fingers does not reach all the way through to the bone and that which is detached from the bone has a rough face: then you should strive for its roughness (or asperity) in order that it may be removed by those blunt instruments with which you have prepared so many numbers, amounts, quantities. So when you will have done this operation on your hand holding the fingers, you must break and cut off that part from bone and shape it as you were able to administer it most conveniently and rightly into whatever place is convenient for them according to what was done by the operation; then do fracture its face or form of it.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	 So you must administer with your reason as first and foremost using your fingers more, then applying the blunt instruments which are more suitable for them.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	 Then you will use after that a more subtle instrument of it.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	 Until no further harm is done by doing it in accordance with its continuous nature until having emptied them for administration and handling of the most subtle of all
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	 In wounds that remain after removing hair and breaking them gently, it is necessary for you to administer the remedy in order to rectify his condition according to what was done when he took [the medicine]
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	 And there is that which cannot be hidden from everyone who has made any kind of study in this art and remained over what we have written down and demonstrated in the large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	 If the loin is detected and you are to take it out when you have removed its os: then it is necessary for you to gather up the loin according to their quantity of wounds, and lower it into rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	 Then take another loin or three of them and lower them into wine and rose oil as well, and place them over the first loin; and so do this with greater ease than that on it, in order to avoid any harm being done
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	 Then administer the ligature over it; and do not bind it, unless according to how much of a wound holds onto it; and loosen it with this care one day or two days until six are securely bound from above.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	 After that, loosen it and administer remedies with those which are in excess of dryness; such as the roots of mallow, flour of herbs, and ashes of turpentine, and aristolochia, and similar to them: and so you will do from these medicines more use than what is done over the wound just like the scab.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	 In every one of them administer every medicine whose property it has so as to stop and not cut.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	 So that your skill may be used well so that the wound becomes clear; and neither shall there be any unclean odors from unguents or foulness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	 Neither should you allow the wound to be gathered together on every part; for when it is gathered upon the loin of the brain, it corrupts him and putrifies him, and causes him to fall upon the sick after such great malice: and now he has fallen into the scalp when his mouth is opened up, particularly when he neglects his care, a black spot on its surface occurs.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	 Therefore, if they occur to a sick person, you know that it is harmful because of its proximity
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	 If the person is not burned but by medicine placed on top of them and it works as a remedy for that person's illness: then you must take one part from honey mixed with three parts olive oil and wrap a linen cloth around your head with this mixture
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	 After placing it on the siphon (a type of medical instrument used in ancient medicine), you should then apply care to him as best you can until he is cured.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	 In case of a break in the restoration process
Caput IIII.	 The head contains 4 parts
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	 You know that the nose breaks in two pieces when only two of its upper parts are broken at once or if one piece of each is broken. So because he has two bones: one below which is cartilaginous and cannot be broken, and another above which can cause damage to him through injury and tortuosity and simitas (not sure what this last term means).
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	 If one of its two pieces is broken, then you must insert your finger into the nostril and with that finger tap on it to break up the bone as much as possible so it fits over her own natural shape. And do this gently with art
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	 So you don't cause any more harm through your operation on him with pain.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	 If it is broken in the upper part of the nose and cannot be reached with your finger: then you must extend the fingers as far apart as possible to where there is a small amount of swelling.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	 If both pieces are broken too and the restoration process should be done within a day after the fracture if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	 And if not then on the seventh or tenth day at a peaceful location you will have to do so with warm towels
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	 After placing it into the nostril with a linen cloth if one piece is broken or two pieces are broken and there should be as much swelling of that size which fits through the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	 "Some restorers of old said that a supply of linen should be abundant and changeable every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	 "For this I do not understand you; it seems necessary to me that linen be abundant and changeable with egg-white.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	 After removing the linen, the mouth is opened up and the cartilage is released from its bonds.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	 And sometimes a feather from the breast of an egg is introduced into the nostril's niche; after that, when it is gently placed upon this same soft membrane: and so it is, that in this manner she holds with great force the fracture of the nose, preventing it not to be hindered by inspiration.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	 And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	 If you wish so, do that; and if you wish so, do the linen.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	 If while you are working on a warm instrument the nostrils become blocked by cold, or with fat or with oil, or through a mixture of these three things;
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	 If this does not happen while working on a warm instrument, then it is necessary that you apply the mixture of flour and egg-white, and press upon him with softened cheese.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	 After placing this over his head, do not allow any of these things to come near the nostrils.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	 If this causes a fracture of the bones or loosening of them, then it is necessary that you cut away from above what remains after these things are broken, and remove him with the instruments which sustain him apart from those things.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	 Then take your scissors, and care for that which is made, and strengthen him with the soft things or ointment.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	 If this happens between the nostrils, then it is necessary that you care for him with the linen; and administer the ointment from lead until he becomes healed.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	 On the restoration of the lower jaw when broken off.
Caput V.	 Head V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	 When the lower jaw is broken off and its fracture was not with the breaking-off of the nose; if only a portion of it was broken away from him so that he does not fall apart into two pieces, but he should be pressed inward: then knowledge to him becomes easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	 "If there is a fracture in the right side of his mouth," you must insert your left index finger into the opening of the mouth; similarly if the fracture is on the left side of the mandible, then put it by inserting your right hand.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	 "If the mandible is separated by fracture into two parts," you should administer an extraction with both hands on both sides in accordance with correctness until there is equality of position.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	 "If the teeth are injured by a movement or breakage," you should pull out those from which they can be removed with a dental floss, or an implement.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	 Then apply a ligature over the fractured mandible.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	 "Then place over it two doubled strips of cloth and one large starched strip; or if you lack them, make the skin of your hand equal to the length of the mandible.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	 "Then tie it over after preparing the ligature as given to you; and apply its application until it is not destroyed; and give him a spoonful of his medicine in ease.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	 "If you find that something has changed in the figure or manner," then come quickly and give him to eat a third time.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	 "Then correct what has been altered from it; and pull him out of the meal with a spoon after straining the broth or liquid, using a linen cloth if you have one, otherwise use flour.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	 "While this is kept over it and not altered by the disposition of his limbs; then remove him to eat until he becomes well or as much as possible.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	 "It must be tied many times in three seven days.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	 "If it occurs to him a cold foot while he is eating," then give that which we have said many times after his meal until the cold foot departs.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	 "And if there is a fracture along with vomiting, consider this.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	 The severed limb is either useless or can be of little use; therefore, apply this remedy to it so that you will be able to remove the bone from its joint with a knife as before.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 If the artery is very narrow, then stretch it out using the phlebotomist in proportion to your need for this purpose.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	 Then when you have removed the satage and nothing remains from them, stretch out the artery if it is broad; but if not, place something over it that fits into this opening, so that it may be restored to its proper state.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	 After the fracture of the phalanges.
Caput VI.	 The Sixth Part (of Surgery).
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	 Certainly the sixth phalange is often broken off from the anterior part by the arm; and its fracture takes one of three forms.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	 Or it may be broken off separately from two parts, apart from the cause that is usually found in its joint; and this makes restoration of it easier
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	 Thus if a satage falls on the bone; and this makes restoration more difficult.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	 Or there may be a fracture with a tear, when some injury to the flesh is inflicted at the same time
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	 And when there is a fracture with no tear present, you should have two surgeons perform the operation; one holds up the phalanges that are broken off and the other extends from below to above part of it.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	 Then if your fingers are equally broken, until its form is made equal to what it should be; and this should not exceed the extent of its ability, nor diminish its compactness
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	 If the fingers are extended further than this, then you should put a small ball of wool or cloth beneath it; and its size should be according to your need for this purpose; extend and hold the phalanges up with one hand, and use the other hand to stretch and pull back the shoulder part.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	 If you are unable to pull the phalanges of the hand outward; because it has been forced deep inside; then put something beneath his arm that is medium in size and press down on one of its fingers with your other finger so that he may open his mouth as before; after this rectify the fracture, making it equal to both of yours.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	 If you hear a saw sound from a cleaver, and it stops; then you should remove the bone attached to it by means of that cleaver, so as to get hold of the bone with ease
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	 If a saw is stuck on the bone; then get it out by making an incision through that saw with one of the saws you prepared for this purpose and once you have grasped the saw from the cleaver [saw], if it's made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And here is how to do it
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	 The cochlea should be filled in a patient who does not have fistula (leak).
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	 Its length is proportional to the depth it reaches through the bones and fullness of its passage.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	 The length of your incision should also be according to what you can reach during surgery.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	 It has two ends; one end is broad and the other narrow
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	 If you disrupted the bone that you removed by the cleaver; then it is broad and secured with sutures at its narrow end; so make two holes in the bone with a saw, together with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	 If it's a small disruption or if you do not need sutures; then make an incision with a saw and open the hole accordingly to the size of the cut.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	 If you have used a hot oil bath; then pour wine and vinegar on it, and put that above it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	 When the narrow end of a bone is without an opening and without being cut; then you should place something above its form that has been made from flour mixed with egg white.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	 And put a linen cloth on it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	 Then place the sphere under its neck if there is an indentation there.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	 Then take the sickle [blade of a scythe] that the Saracens use which is long and broad; its width will be one palm's breadth or around it.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	 And then place two layers on top of the linen cloth and put a bandage above that.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	 "Then take a small plate and measure its width by measuring with three fingers; its length will be similar.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	 "After that, put the plate on cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	 "After that, place it (the plate) where the falling object had fallen and its location was known.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	 "Then place it over the fracture in such a way as to be removed by the removal of one part and the support provided; then put it on top of his head with both hands, and supporting him with gentle strength from below while supporting him with weakness from above; lower it completely so that nothing is left except for its broken parts. And you will see how when a straight line holds together two straight lines, this should also hold together the fractured part in order to fix it.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	 "So that he may be able every day to support himself as much as possible.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	 "Because the ligment was relaxed and you could remove it; then correct that thing and tie back the ligment.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	 "Then place him with one hand under his back and put the other hand next to it on his chest; put one arm below his ribs when he is sleeping at night so that you can support him as an assistant.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	 "Therefore, a fractured elbow should be treated through the elevation of the arm.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	 "Or tie both hands around his neck and do not break loose unless the accident happened by a fall or from another person; for up to 12 days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	 "Then remove the plaster if you see that its face is directed towards it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	 "And add to it when necessary and remove it once healed; until restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	 "And the fractured elbow is held together with a ligment for up to 120 days; and sometimes it happens among people.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	 "Of the restoration of fractures (of bones).
Caput VII.	 "Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	 "A rare fracture occurs to the spatula and it happens at its side; except for its margins (edges).
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	 When it is cut from there a cut occurs at the middle of its, and is not known except by touch; then according to which part of its figure the separation is made
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	 And move it over the natural figure with all ingenuity, which is possible for you
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	 Then place it on top of the cleaned skin with a sponge and lye, and put it over as if from another cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	 Then place it on top of the prepared surface with a narrow spatula according to its length and the size of the entire spatula, either greater or less than this one.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	 If the surface below is not suitable for use with this spatula, then you should bring it to an equal size as if using another spatula after spreading some lye on it.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	 Then spread with the longest and narrowest part of its length, and with the firmness of its spatula until it is not removed from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	 And consider the ligaments every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Whenever it weakens, you should tighten it and place the spatula on top of its healthy side if removed from its place; then rest it over its long side as before.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	 The spatula will be restored within twenty days or within one hundred and twenty days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	 When this number is complete, then tie it securely; you are safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	 This is from the bones whose community cannot be trusted or solved by them.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	 If it comes out of a bone and bites under its own flesh then place it on top of itself and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	 And do what we said about the fracture of a thigh bone from the pain of heated irons if you encounter something while removing it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	 Of the restoration of the shoulder bone's fracture.
Caput VIII.	 The eighth part.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	 The breastbone sometimes breaks in its middle and rarely happens to that one.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	 Its extremities are the most likely to break from accidents with them.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	 "When his middle bone is broken and drops downward towards the inferior position, causing him great pain in his back area; with difficulty in walking upright, and therefore he may lose blood or die from a fractured spine. And if this occurs without consciousness returning, then surgery must be performed to allow him to lie on his back again.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	 "Then his humerus and collarbones must be straightened out as much as possible towards the two sides or elbows with hands: and by skillful manipulation of them to find a position that is comfortable for him so he may resume normal use again.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	 "Then he must place a plaster on top of him to cover his wounds and put another plate above the first one so it covers all his wounds: or use bandages soaked with salt water or vinegar as well.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	 "Then the surgeon must wrap her around his broken limb so it does not move at all; and after applying a bandage in a round shape towards the back of his body some distance away from where he was wounded, tie it with a fine cord tightly.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	 "The surgeon must consider the bandage at all times and every time it is loosened, tie it tighter; if he finds a solution for his case with oil or vinegar to treat what has occurred in that place, then apply this solution immediately: but otherwise remove the plaster and correct where the injury happened with his care.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	 "If he finds that he can put it back on again after removing the bandage.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	 "Regarding restoration of fractures.
Caput IX.	 The ninth head.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	 "Remember that a fracture of the ribs does not occur unless it is in the large areas following the back and from the extremities away from the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	 "And they do not suffer attrition except because of their cartilaginous nature.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	 "Their consciousness is not lost when interrogated with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	 "His restoration should be such that the broken part is fitted together with fingers following an appropriate manner so as to look like the original.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	 "Then the splint and hold the fractured jaw by a star if necessary.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	 "If the bones of the jaws are broken in pieces towards their inside - then there occurs a great pain and numbness from this, as well as puncturing it with much force if one has many blood vessels; therefore, so that the mouth is painful and difficult to breathe for him, and also he suffers from difficulty in swallowing due to which his face becomes pale because of lack of breath: and these are very difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	 "Moreover, inventors of devices are also found in there with many fingers: and from these come those who say to place food into the mouth of an inflamed one who generates inflammation and thirst so that it is inflamed inside as well as extended, and forced by the fracture towards the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	 "We are afraid lest there be no cause for coldness when trying to make a hot meal if it is not necessary.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	 "If however the cold occurs then he adds into him.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	 "And some of them said: 'It should be placed above the place and sucked with force then it is similar reasoning.'
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	 "However, however there may be fear that the sucking of too much food into the place due to weakness of the person.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	 "And some of them said: 'It is necessary to make the place cooperate with wool that has been submerged into hot oil and should be placed between the bones so that it may become loosened, until it is equal to when being pulled out according to roundness.'
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	 "Then the weak person was cured through food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	 "If the weak person becomes too thin and does not tolerate this, then the mouth is painful because of the fracture causing numbness; therefore it should be that we cut above the place and pull out the fractured bone.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	 "We shall place upon it a tool that holds it securely in place; its remembrance precedes this: and we cut with ease.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	 "We then gather the two upper lips together if it is large enough to be stitched; and we remove with plasters what has been cut off.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	 "And if the lukewarm instrument comes temporarily; now we put it into a container of oil and warm water to make it ready; after which we remove what has been sewn up.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	 "Also, if anything falls off the upper lip while asleep, then we put it back in place until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	 "For repairing a fracture of the spine and neck.
Caput X.	 "Head X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	 "Collarbones are sometimes fractured and rarely suffer attrition; the same applies to the spine as well.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	 "Thus if it happens to someone who is knowledgeable about this subject and has knowledge of how to treat them; but if not, then we look for a doctor.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	 "And if his hands are already softened and stiffened and dead; and he cannot move them nor stretch or tie them with your finger; but when you try to press on them gently with your thumb then it is not felt by him and they do not feel any pain, because of their death: at that point you know that nothing can be done for them, in fact the situation is fatal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	 "If he moves them and feels their tightness with your finger tips; you know that a certain treatment is available for him.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 "If the neck behaves like a hand that is soft and stiffened; you know that it can be treated as well.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	 "No need for his labor.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	 If he had not injured him with anything from that, it would have been less harmful.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	 His care which caused the injury is such that you should administer a soothing ointment with warm oil; if someone else does this for you, please do so instead.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	 Place the ointment over that part of his body with several applications each day until he is completely soothed; if someone else does this for you, please do so instead.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	 Do not let him rest on the part where he suffered pain until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	 If it was caused by a breaking away of the bones or tendons; if something separate was caused from that source, then you should wash over his wound and bring him this.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	 Then, with two stitches on both lips, if it is a large one.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with another person using an ointment until he is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	 If the hind limb bones are broken away and the end of the tail has come; then you should insert your left hand's index finger into his anus, and break both ears with another hand, as much as possible, and second by second until he is healed.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then place over him and bring it; and care for the wound with what precedes, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	 From the restoration of Anchae
Caput XI.	 The 11th head.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	 Rare are the bones of Anchae's broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	 If the bones of Anchae's are broken but not by comminution; and they are split longitudinally, and they fall towards the inside; there is pain inflicted from that spot, a wound, and the limbs which were cut off.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	 And its restoration to him is as follows: you place your hand over it until it becomes healed in the same way that figure of his was.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	 When there is only one fragment of bone to be worked on, then restore that fracture according to the method with which you were shown how it was done for yourself from the equation provided.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	 If there is a fracture that extends into the bone's length, or it has already bent towards its inner part, then proceed to apply pressure against your hand, until you are able to restore the fractured part for yourself.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	 After you have restored the bone to its proper shape by applying pressure against your hand, then place a plaster over that part of it which has been fractured and secured with pins or sutures; after that, put an arrow made from wood or thread above the fracture as well, so that you may not disturb the alignment of the bone until it is healed.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	 And after you have restored it to its proper condition by applying pressure with your hand, until the fracture has healed according to equality; and apply an ointment on that part of the bone so that the person who is treating the fracture rests their head on their back or shoulder as appropriate.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	 If the arrow is heated up (which I assume means if it gets too hot), then stop applying pressure to that part of the bone and restoring it until you have cooled down the arrow; after that, place back over it what supported it before, according to how it was placed originally, so that its restoration continues. And apply a bandage around it as needed.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	 If the arrow went through bone or cartilage instead, then remove and dispose of it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	 Information on restoring a fracture by an assistant
Caput XII.	 The twelfth part (of Albucasis' text).
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	 An assistant is that which is between the elbow and the head of a spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	 If it breaks then the restoration of this part follows one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	 One method is to use a flat medium length piece of wood according to that shape which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	 And two ligaments are tied at both ends of it.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	 Then it is suspended from the place where it was removed and the person treating the fracture rests on a bed or table.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	 As soon as the arm was broken and laid upon a stick, it would gently move towards its tip
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	 Once you suspend it above something heavy, so that it extends downwards
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	 The physician would attend to the broken arm simultaneously with both hands, until the fracture is healed according to what should happen
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	 Another method was that the patient would be lifted over their own bed and suspended from above by the hand of one of them holding it at the back with a cord.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	 Two persons would help lift the patient over their own bed and hold onto them above the broken arm each with both hands; one of the two to hold at the bottom of him and extend downwards towards his other side
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	 If needed to increase the stretch then hold under the arm with a cord and above it with another, and have one of them extend towards each side respectively.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	 If the fracture is near to one of the ends of the arm then it would be necessary for one person to place a cord under its tip and another under the broken elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	 If it is near to the elbow then one person should place a cord above its location and another over the elbow.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	 When the fracture is equally facilitated and without much effort until the fracture has been equalized according to what should happen then bind it securely with a good application if it does not slip from cold hands.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	 If by chance the hands slip away at the seventh day let the binding be released until then.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	 Place above it a strong cord soaked with vinegar and oil, until the hands have become still; then bind securely onto it; and the mode of binding is to place a bandage over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	 Then apply a fresh bandage on top of it.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	 Finally suspend the arm over an assistant and place your hand open onto its own shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	 "Place a cloth on your shoulder and extend it over the broken arm so that the injured limb remains in its place; if something is not permitted to be placed above you by this, do not let anything fall upon you from bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	 "If something is permitted to be placed above you from the broken bone, then use a stronger arrow to do so; otherwise, place an arrow on top of it that has been damaged and is weaker than others.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	 "And place an arrow between all the arrows in length of your hand; let the length of the arrows be according to their fracture and with an additional three fingers from every part.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	 "Finally, extend the stretch above the arrows as I described at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	 "And let your stretch be stronger over the place where the fracture is more restricted.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	 "The longer the fracture, the smaller the stretch should be.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	 "If you want the stretch and length as described at the time when you restore the member quickly, then do this; if a cold arrow is used, loosen up the stretch and arrows until tomorrow, exactly like we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	 "After that, consider the ligament for three days so it doesn't cause itching or inflation to your body as you move towards the member; due to excess of fluid in stretch.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	 "Therefore, do this entirely according to what we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	 "If you are above the faith so nothing is allowed from it; then only loosen up the ligament, not after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	 "And let there be a pillow above his back and his hand over his stomach; put it below the support with full wool evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	 "Consider at all times of night or day so that nothing loosens up the fractured member or softens the ligament.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	 "Therefore do this entirely with your own skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	 "And put food to the infirmary according to what we've described so that his body is first soft and then he begins eating; at this time you must let him eat more.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	 In accordance with the custom of a barber and an assistant for cutting hair is that it should be shaved every forty days; therefore, at this time it must be shaved off, and medicated with some ointment to soothe it
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	 If a fracture has occurred, apply this as soon as possible; shave off the hair and tie it up with threads until after 50 days have passed, or two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	 Of the restoration of the arm bone (shoulder).
Caput XIII.	 The thirteenth head
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	 The shoulder is composed of two bones called the clavicle and the scapula.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	 Of one of which (the clavicle) it is narrow; and that follows with the hand.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	 The other one being broad, and following beneath by a lesser part from below.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	 Therefore if the larger clavicle is broken alone or narrow; and if both are broken together.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	 When therefore the upper clavicle breaks, then its restoration is easy, and healing easier still.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	 And when it breaks beneath, the fracture to him is bad, and the healing more difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	 It's worse then if both bones are broken together.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	 Therefore when it breaks the clavicle above alone, then he should come to a doctor for its restoration, so that he might place upon it a narrow strap with ease and relaxation until equality is reached.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	 If the upper clavicle has broken this one; then he should do that it might be put on a stronger strap.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	 And it is necessary to place the form of the hand for his restoration and lengthening over the thumb.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	 And the hand of the fingers to the superior shall be higher than all other fingers; and the articular inferior to all others or the rest, and seated square upon himself, and the thumb before him, or on his side directly, at height in order that he may not fall into a weaker position.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	 Afterwards extends the arm of the forearm downward, either with his hand, or using a cord.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	 Another surgeon extended himself out from above in a similar manner
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	 Then the physician takes his mouth and reduces it to its best form possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	 If a bone has broken, then you should reduce every fragment back into its original place with the help of your skill.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	 If you see a separation of the flesh and it becomes inflamed; then there is no hope for his restoration: turn him over onto himself and restore him to his original position as before.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	 If a fracture has occurred with a wound, then I made this specific finger-like splint for him so that you can take care of him from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	 If you are beginning to make a restoration of the flesh and it is too cold then turn the bandage around with some olive oil, and white cloth; so that there will be an even medium between smoothness and subtlety: and tie the bandage over onto him tightly as before until his restoration has ended. Then remove the bandage from around him and put on a prepared plaster made of flour mixed with water to restore it completely.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	 Afterwards he puts them there; so that the star which is placed over the fracture itself is larger and stronger than before.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	 You know that there are six stars on the arm usually; either if a fracture occurs at one place among them or two places simultaneously.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	 Afterwards he puts your bandage over the fracture and tighter than before; as well as much stronger with a tight bandage above the fracture or below it: also put on a looser bandage to replace what has gone from his previous bandage's memory at the beginning of this chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	 And there are bandages that you can put over the fracture; soft ones, moistened with water; and they should not be rough or hard.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	 The thread is made from linen properly, in between the fine and coarse parts as described before.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	 After a day or two.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	 If something whose repair is necessary occurs, like the itch that occurred to a member: then you should wet the body part with heated water and wait until the itching stops; when you remove the bandage do not tighten it too much as before so that it can stop on its own after being removed from around.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	 "If the narrowing has already been softened and the nose is now remote, similar cases should be corrected in the same way; consider each one.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	 "If feeding is prohibited to enter the member due to excess narrowing, then it should be corrected by first softening what surrounds it more and releasing it after a certain number of days; until its nourishment arrives, hold off on binding it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	 "If nothing has been weakened among those things that we have spoken of, then it should not be corrected by a solution until after twenty days, or in a different manner.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	 "...and hold off the hand while the weakness is with him [i.e., bound to his neck].
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	 "And let its neck be equalized and be held by your virtue against any movement.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	 "...and let him lie on his back [i.e., supine].
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	 "And you know that this fracture is to be corrected within thirty days, or within thirty and two days; possibly within one hundred days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	 "...it's all done according to the dispositions of the complexion and virtue.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	 "On restoration of fractures
Caput XIIII.	 "The twelfth chapter on the restoration of fractures.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	 "You know that the fingers often suffer from a fracture in the hand.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	 "...and it does not happen to him unless there is much weariness.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	 "If the plants fracture happens due to fatigue or weariness; then it should be corrected by letting him lie flat and having his seat adjusted according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	 "...then put the hand upon that extending object.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	 "...and extends the broken bones of the minister and equalizes them; until they are united by a good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	 "Then it is appropriate that he put on an emollient ointment if there isn't a warm one available.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	 "...then place the bandage upon his back according to the quantity of the place; and you already have placed it on him [i.e., into a linen bandage].
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	 If a bone has been broken in such a way that it extends towards the center of the plant, then fashion something like a ball out of linen and apply it to the affected part with some sort of bandage; bind tightly so as to support the fractured limb securely while also supporting its own branch or limb.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	 And there is an asterisk on which the length of ease can be applied to the body of the plant; and bind it so that it may stretch out according to need.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	 If a bone has been broken towards the outside, then it is necessary to place an asterisk on top of it and another one at its base on the plant; open your hand completely straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	 After placing the strap tightly as before, extend between the fingers with a bandage.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	 If the bone is broken in any of the finger joints, then it should be bent according to need if there are no other injuries.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	 After binding as before with the plant and if you wish, place a right-angled asterisk on its head and one flat one at its base; so that it may be held in place securely without moving around.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	 If the bone is broken in any of the other fingers (middle, ring finger or little finger), then bend it as before and bind with a healthy digit following it; or bind them all according to their connection together so that they are all good.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	 Or place the flat one over its head just like we said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	 And consider during your restoration and after placing the others with warm fingers; and place it as needed when something happens to him according to his description in its narrative.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	 Of bone fracture of the wrist
Caput XV.	 Chapter Fifteen
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	 The shoulder joint is often broken and it's declared to be so because the head turned towards inside and outside parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 Its restoration is done thus: you bind the ligament above the break with another one below the break.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	 And if it's weakened, he extends his face upwards.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	 "Therefore he stretches out every ligament towards his own limb proportionally
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 "If a fracture is near the elbow joint (Coxae), then he stretches out the ligament towards the chest side to enable extension upwards; and another ligament underneath the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	 "And similarly if a fracture is near the knee joint (genu), then he stretches out the nearest ligament towards the lower part to enable extension downwards; and another ligament underneath the fracture.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	 "Therefore the surgeon extends his own hands towards each other proportionally to match their natural shape; and joins them with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	 "Then he must place splints and dressings if the limb is not restored perfectly.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	 "If it should fail to heal after a certain period of time (days), then he releases him until the limb becomes warm; and thereafter returns him for your care.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	 "His dressings shall be thus:
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	 "He places a hard band over the fracture itself, namely to prevent the separation of the bones; and binds two or more tightly on either side for support; and any excess shall be removed.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	 "Afterwards he adjusts his fingers until the heel touches the root of the foot [nerves].
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	 "Then he places a long cord between the elbow and the leg near the knee to extend upwards; and the fingers of both hands on either side.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	 "Thereafter they are adjusted over the wrist and elbow, until whatever is left from above fits underneath.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	 "Then he places a star on top of each shoulder where there was a fracture; and one star below the mouth (cranium).
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	 "He adjusts his fingers between the legs and elbow with the help of bandages to ensure an even tightness.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	 "Then he begins with four or more bindings on either side over the place where there were three fractures; and then adds another to even it out.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	 "And as you add more of them towards the place of fracture, your own tightness becomes less tight and softer; and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	 "Having opened up the two extremities, you cut between the thigh and calf.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	 Therefore tie three stars which are above it.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	 Then close with the two extremities to the lower part, until you reach the foot of the calf.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	 And tie also the three stars on one side, so that the bond is not removed from its own place
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	 Then remove the band above this [point], while keeping it in place, so that no member cutting, or pulling back, or inflation occurs there, nor anything of a similar nature
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	 So if something is removed from there.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	 Therefore, after removing the solution and correcting what was cut off at that point as we said many times before.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	 If you chop bone on to bone when it hits [i.e., if the knife cuts into a bone], then it is necessary for you that this [point] be adjusted so that if it's possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	 And if not, find above the solution and remove it; and care with him who preceded in remembrance so that he may be healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	 And when this is tied with a broken thigh bone, apart from adding the stars as we said earlier, so that it may be healed and braced in both assistance and support
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	 However, if he is restored by this means broken, there was no weakness of the leg
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	 And if it is restored only by adding to him the other thigh, then necessity arises so that he who had it always will be unable [to walk].
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	 You know that the thigh can be tied for 50 days or added to a limited extent; sometimes it is lessened also in an equal manner; all of this depends on the variety and state of what remains after subtracting the other member.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	 Of the restoration of the broken thighbone.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter Sixteen
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	 You know that the thigh bone is rarely broken, but it often suffers from atrophy.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	 If a bone is broken then it must be either fractured or through an opening (in this case a hole).
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	 It is accompanied by pain and without injury/damage
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	 From the top of that goes the whole with sense (or feeling).
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	 The restoration of that is such as to make equal what was broken from the parts (of his body) by using hands until he gathers it and binds it according to what can be done through a balance and easily, with making/fabrication.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	 Then put a plaster on the forearm from ground meal or of powder made with eggs and put over it a round star if you are not able to reach high then bind/tie it tightly above in order that it may be applied there.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	 Then consider all the dispositions which we mentioned in other fractures as a hot iron and similar things to him: so that you may oppose against every injury with what he was able, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	 Of the restoration of a broken leg
Caput XVII.	 Chapter seventeen
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	 It should be noted that the legs have two bones of which one is large and called by its name Cruris and the other is subtle and called Feclis.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	 And both were broken by the same kind of fracture in two parts of the arms and because of this there was the restoration/treatment of that limb as the treatment of the arm is one operation.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	 If both bones break at once then they are turned towards all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	 And if the subtle bone is broken it is turned/bent towards the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	 If the large bone breaks then they are downwards from that.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	 Then administer an extension (of treatment), and balance/equilibrium, and tying of stars according to it equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	 However if the fracture of Cruris is a broken limb you have to use many bands/straps so that it may be an extension less than and quieter your hands are used for it.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	 "There is something to be found in the operation over the arm; and it happens when you equally balance on both sides, and all take your own operation, then take two stakes from wood which are used for making tables [boards], as they are placed under boards: and they will become palm leaves. And choose one of those with a small thickness, so that none may be by the size; and it is length to them according to the length of the arm up to the lower part of the elbow.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	 "Then apply two of your own solutions around a single piece of cloth, according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	 "Put one part on the elbow, and another on the other side; and it will go from the elbow down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	 "Then tie two stakes around at each end of your cloth, between them.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	 "Since the stretch is forbidden to be done in one direction only, it falls down towards the right and left; and at a fixed place stands firm.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	 "And indeed, the cincture of wood is done according to the length of the arm, and it will be placed on him who needs it; so that he may hold onto it by force.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	 "And furthermore, if you need to make a split when the wound is already open properly.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	 "Then consider your cincture every day; and with it practice last until you become familiar with all its uses, whether by burning or other ways.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	 "If something falls to that cincture then hold it as long as you can until you are able to heal if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	 "About the fracture of the foot and fingers.
Caput XVIII.	 "Head 18th.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	 "The heel is not broken by a crack in it.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	 "In the foot and fingers there can be a fracture; and of the fingers also a fracture happens but seldom; and it does not happen to them unless attrition through many circumstances.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	 "If there is a fracture in the foot, and you wish to raise it up by yourself; then he takes his sickly foot placed ready on the ground like a stretcher.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	 "At that point you should place your foot on the other which is lifted by those bones; afterward smear it with oil and apply evenly.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	 "Afterward place your foot on top of that [bone], then put a cloth under the toes which have two flat pieces.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	 "Then draw it with a gentle [motion] of the foot, after you use it with the cloth and those others who need.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	 "When three or four days have passed then remove the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	 "You will make it level if they are fractured, dislocated or not properly positioned [i.e., not aligned].
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	 "Therefore the operation is done as you understand.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	 "If any of your fingers are broken then restore them and arrange them according to what I showed you in the restoration of the fingers.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	 "Afterward place your finger into its own little ring according to the length of your fingers and make it a bit smaller on that side; then put under the foot the cloth as I showed you.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	 "If it is broken due to the bones being two or three or more then put a ring on every finger of its quantity and bind it with linen; then place it under one of the toes so that there may be good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	 "And you will remember to avoid bending it so that all of what I said to you regarding the fractures from accidents which we mentioned, and confront every accident with [the treatment for] that.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	 "Of a fracture of the upper arm bone, or humerus, or the bones in the chest and forearms.
Caput XIX.	 The twentieth chapter.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	 When a fracture of a woman's arm occurs then place her on a square rest.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	 Afterward incline it towards the back of that shoulder and let it hang backwards.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	 Afterward insert a support into the woman's armpit so that she is held securely; and let it be as if from her like a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	 After the woman has been sewn up and her back is bandaged
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	 Then this tool is brought out, so that it may be placed before the vulva as a ball, and the mouth is opened
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	 And then a small piece of silk is put on his back
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	 Once the tool has been lubricated and brought forward quickly, it is withdrawn with ease; then you apply some more lubrication and reduce it to its original size as much as possible, so that when inserted first time, it goes in easily: thereafter return it to its own opening.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	 This will be done over a period of seven days or by way of another route, until the mouth is restored back to normal.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	 And if so you wish, take a sheath made of sheep's skin and fasten it over the opening of his urethra with cordage made from rushes, then introduce the entire sheath into your vagina.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	 Then breathe slowly and smoothly through it until the sheath is stretched inside the vagina to its full length, after which you can break off any excess part.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	 And afterwards with this tool it will last for a certain number of days as we have agreed upon until the pain is relieved.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	 And when the mouth of the man or woman has been broken, then you administer restoration to him and his equivalent as we have agreed upon by way of Anchae.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	 And not the anus should be hidden from him after his injury is treated so that he can recover as much as possible.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	 And you should learn my book well because the very word 'fracture' means different things to me and also to many people depending on their situation or use; therefore understand this.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	 And for the man when he has been broken you take a rooster's beak and introduce it into him.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	 Then a cloth is put on his solution and he is inflated as much as possible; afterwards it will last for three days or by way of another route until he is cured if God wills it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	 And from the restoration of bones that have been broken when they are with a wound.
Caput XX.	 The twelfth head
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	 The twelfth head was fractured with a sharp blow to the skull, especially if it is large; similarly as in the case of the cheekbones or the nose, so that you must quickly apply ligatures and tourniquets and remove the blood immediately: if conditions for phlebotomy are established according to our instructions.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	 If the wound is bleeding excessively at that time you should immediately apply ligatures to stop the bleeding and remove it as quickly as possible; unless something else needs to be done right away.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	 Then begin to repair the fracture on that very same day, and do not defer it unless another injury has occurred.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	 If a cold injury occurs after the fracture, then postpone repair until one day later, unless it settles down spontaneously.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	 And do not apply to him on the third or fourth day, as you will cause further harm to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	 If the nose is fractured and protruding through an opening in the skin, then you should immediately reduce it to its normal position while gently pressing and stretching it with your hands.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	 If no extension is available for him, nor his adjustment by hand, then reduce to its normal position using that instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And the instrument is one made from iron with seven or eight fingers in length and its width corresponds to that of your finger, except for the thumb which has a smaller width than all other fingers.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	 And because of this it is necessary for a physician to receive three or four treatments depending on the size as required by the condition of fracture in all its types.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	 And it should be rounded to prevent it from being pushed aside under the force of compression during surgery and it must have a sharp edge to cut through flesh with an open hand for cutting wounds on its sides or corners.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	 And above all, make sure you apply the instrument from the middle of it up to its bottom end so that no other part gets in the way during surgery.
Et haec est forma eius.	 This is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	 Let him be operated on such that an acute curved edge is placed over his extremity by the prominent fingers of one hand; and with this hand he will press down upon it gently until he has released the lips and equalized them with some fluid
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	 So that the fractured extremities may be aligned
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	 If his extremities are fractured and he cannot accept the tool by grasping it properly then let him strike at them with his fingers until he has control over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	 If you cannot reduce them with him as we have described above then strike him in whatever manner is possible for you to do.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	 After that let the remaining part of bone be rubbed gently and carefully with a coarse emery stone.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	 And if after the reduction he is still in great pain then you know that his lips did not return to their proper place.
Fac ergo illud.	 Do this therefore
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	 And if you are now complete in restoring the restoration that you have done to his limbs.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	 After this let him throw off the bandage with a black cloth.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	 And if it is still summer
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	 Nor should you place over the wound any ointment or thing that contains oil so as not to cause irritation on it and prevent any corruption or decay from occurring.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	 After this administer these things at the appropriate time of your restoration.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And cut away the wound as you strike with your fingers through a hole that is made to allow blood circulation according to the amount of wounds.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	 With all caution do not tie up the wound if it has been broken.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	 Therefore many of these remedies have been devised by doctors and they did harm either to the patients themselves or their death or decay or putrefaction, that is, to no avail.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	 And make your stitches soft, gentle and diverse from those of fractured parts.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	 "If a wound is bad or great, there are other wounds that come upon us and cause pain; therefore, it should not be applied until later.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	 "And apply a solution from hard cloths to the wound itself.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	 "When one or two days have passed since the wound was inflicted and it is beginning to generate pus; then wash off what you applied over it with vinegar.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	 "After that, we apply a remedy and ointments which are by our custom applied to wounds; such as the tetrapharmakon ointment and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	 "And make sure you have enough bandage for it.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 "Consider the wound daily and often, until it heals completely and is healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	 "It's necessary to carefully remove the limb so that the pus flows downwards more easily.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	 "If many days pass and it doesn't heal or get better; then you know that the bandage is now too tight.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	 "Therefore, be careful to examine the wound as soon as possible.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	 "Remove any remaining rags and get rid of them separately.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	 "If anything from those rags remain stuck to the limb and cause pain; pull it out of there gently and remove as much pus as possible.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	 "If the limb is infected or rotten; that is, infested with worms, or some other corruption and putrefaction; then it's necessary to have someone who has used what he applied remove from there as much pus as possible.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	 "And from that you have to make sure my speech stays strong and I'll give it the present thought when your mouth opens up; like the coxae and assistant, as well as similar ones in the big organs of the body, so that you won't let him go free unless he is very important. After all, many times he has caused death from there because of his actions.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	 One hundred and one days
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	 If you require medical care within a day of injury or within thirty days (30), otherwise remove it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	 In case of fracture healing the wound should be treated: either on the first day, or within thirty days (30). Otherwise, clean the wound.
Caput XXI.	 Twenty-first
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	 This fracture healing has caused multiple wounds
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	 It's a matter of the greatest importance (most important), which is in connection with these wounds: and it leads to swelling of the body part
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	 And if this limb is being operated on by itself,
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	 So that if the treatment is within a day of injury or within thirty days (30), then administer medicines which have astringency in them: as aloe, and hyssop, and myrrh, and colocynth, and acacia, and similar ones to those
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	 So that you may apply these ones or all of them: and mix with a wine bandage, or a white bandage, or vinegar; and put the bundle on the treatment place, and bind it tightly to good stitches (suture).
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	 And remove the suture after many days have passed.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	 After that, remove one of them and repeat with another until the treatment is done (the healing has taken place).
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	 Or tie it tightly to the bandage from above downward.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	 Therefore, water is a property of all things that are bound out (removed) by the body parts.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the treatment has already been done on a hard surface and is tight and needs to be loosened because of the necessity for doing it (healing), then find from above his part, and cut off the excess moisture that is prominent; or tie it with some other material until it's done (until healing takes place).
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	 When the cure has been restored and the limb is after that delicate, not according to its own nature.
Caput XXII.	 Twenty-second
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	 When healing of the bones is restored and the limb after that delicate, weak; then it cannot happen (heal) except by many causes
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	 "One solution is available for a ligature and ligation of its own kind, either by restricting it due to an excess of ligament tightening or preventing the movement of nourishment to the member when necessary, but not allowing any nourishment to be taken from outside: or because of excessive lubrication in non-time, or because of the scarcity of blood within the body's weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	 The care for him is feeding him and keeping his body firm until there are many times as much blood within him.
Et administra balneum.	 And applying a poultice
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	 "And introducing joy and gladness over him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	 Then, place a wick above the member so that it may draw much nourishment to itself.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	 And he diligently applies warm water with lubrication until it draws the nourishment and returns to its natural figure.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	 "When the care of broken bones will be restored, then.
Caput XXIII.	 The 23rd head.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	 "When the member has been restored after treatment of its own kind and there is stiffness in the bone due to fracture and prominence, or perhaps a knot forms - then it should be torn out using that form so that the member cannot be hindered from its own operation: at this time you will not need to give him a speech.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	 "And there have been many physicians and restorers who did it in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	 And this operation is very fearful to do, leading either to death or great sorrow, as it leads to the fact that it is called a death.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	 "But if the weakness and knot have just happened: then it is necessary to lubricate with warm water, which are boiled soothing herbs like those of alder trees or bitter ones, root included.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	 "And let the bandage be made with a soft, lubricated paste as if it had been made from hemp fiber.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	 "Or, ground alder bark can be used, or chicken fat and honey as a paste mixed with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	 The bones are cut off, and with wax they are prepared to be applied over a heated iron, so that the medicines may decrease in strength due to their heat.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	 At times, it is permitted for breathing with a constant friction and warmth, ancient, and gentle, which occurs while the fingers of the hand are in use.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	 The movements of all members shall be applied to each part equally from above everywhere.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	 However, if the tortuousness has preceded and was strong and conversed with a stone, and provoked necessity to its cure by iron, then it is necessary that his superior be cleared off of excessive swelling with bones, and to continue the continuation by them, and to strike what remains from the nodation or the bone with subtle razors: and the administration shall take place in him with solicitude and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	 About the dislocation of the knee.
Caput XXIIII.	 The 24th head
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	 Dislocation is the breaking off from its usual place by one or both of the joints.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	 Because it is forbidden to move that member itself and it becomes a figure of the limb.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	 And causes the superior pain and wounds very much.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	 When then dislocation occurs to an extremity, it is necessary that it be treated at once for its restoration, and not delay any of the others.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	 If delayed, he must lose his place, or may have with him a reduction in dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	 Therefore it is not necessary for that member to move so that its extension does not occur at the time of the separation from him.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	 Because often he causes an attack on spasms and pain the more.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	 Indeed when that occurs then it is necessary to apply as quickly as possible to phlebotomy.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	 Then he must wait until the separation is finished and quiet.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	 Then his member shall be treated with hot water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	 Then it will decrease very quickly.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And all the members, except that one which is forgotten at its place shall be treated with him.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	 I have already made an incision for dislocation and also according to what came before it on fracture, up to the inferior part of his body.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	 Treatment for dislocated lower jaw
Caput XXV.	 The 25th book
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	 The two jaws are rarely dislocated.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	 When both jaws are dislocated, they heal in one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	 Or, they may move back to their original position and heal by themselves.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	 Or they may be dislocated completely and heal to their original position, so that the lower jaw can move and close normally again, but cannot hold it open or allow it to fall, while its tongue is moving up with a sound.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	 When the dislocation happens frequently, then he returns from several positions by himself slowly.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	 If the dislocation is complete and whole, then it should be corrected quickly either by reduction or traction; he must maintain his position to prevent loss of tongue movement: and it is necessary for him to have the physician apply a finger in one hand into the root of the jaw's dislocation through the mouth if there is one.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	 Or he may introduce two fingers at once if the dislocation happens to both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	 And his other hand must hold them steady as they are applied.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	 He should instruct the patient to relax both jaws and allow them to move naturally back towards their original position.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And the physician holds the jaws steady until they return to their normal position.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	 If the correction is difficult or both jaws are dislocated at once, then he should administer a reduction with hot oil and water until it becomes easy to correct them together; and not prolong either of their corrections separately as we said before.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	 When they have returned and are steady, the physician should press gently on them with a pad soaked in oil; he should also apply heated oil if there is any doubt whether it was made from wax or not.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	 With ease when ligatures are softened
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	 Sleep is placed upon the back of his head; and its chin lies between two veins, so that it does not move to either side; lest he be moved by force or compelled to eat; a little fluid (phlegm) must be swallowed with ease: until the pains subside, and then shall it be applied.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	 It should not rest upon the mouth of his own body during eating or drinking, lest he fall asleep; until the mandible is set, and he is restored.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	 If the reduction of both mandibles is difficult, when they are dislocated in a certain hour; then they cannot be restored to their places; often thereafter fevers arise, and excessive heat follows: and perhaps, he may vomit pure bile (choleric) phlegm.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	 So you know this; for if it is lost (the mandible), many people lose their life after being struck by it within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	 Of the reduction of dislocations in the lower arm and shoulder blades.
Caput XXVI.	 The 26th head.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	 Indeed, the furcula (collarbone) is not dislocated from its own side by a slip of flesh alone.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	 It can be dislocated occasionally on the outside; and it is declared to him who sees it.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	 And its restoration is that he may rest his body upon it and extend his arms
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	 Then with your arm as a support; for she shall be restored.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	 Then he will place the bandage upon it and the wounds and tighten her up.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	 The extremities of his body which follow from his arm; they shall continue with him, unless dislocated very rarely.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it is dislocated on any day; then you must reduce and equalize as we have said and what was prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	 Then he will place the bandage upon it and the wounds and tighten up the stitches.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	 Until a man is healthy and tranquil, he should not eat.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	 And when the same treatment reduces the extremity of the arm to such an extent that it separates from its own place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	 On the subject of dislocations in the human arm.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	 It is known that the humerus does not dislocate unless it follows one of three modes.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	 One of these modes allows for dislocation at the tip to become detached from below.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	 The second mode causes dislocation in the shoulder area.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	 And possibly it dislocates to a higher degree of the arm, which is rare.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	 It does not dislocate at the back because of the shoulder blade.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	 And it doesn't dislocate forward due to nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	 It is possible for the dislocation to occur at the tip and become detached from below, especially among those whose arms are weak.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	 Because it can follow both outward and inward movements simultaneously or one after another.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	 It is uncommon for this to occur in those with many weak muscles.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	 And sometimes it happens to some people by accident or injury, and the arm becomes dislocated in a heated manner from its opposite side, which is due to this because he has already been dislocated once.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	 Therefore you should observe it and proceed with its treatment until certain of the certainty is given to him.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	 It can be distinguished from a dislocated arm and a healthy one when dislocation occurs at the tip.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	 You must note the difference between them and look for any movement at the shoulder area, even if it only moves like a dislocated arm when it touches the head of the arm: and cannot an infirm person reduce his hand to touch her own ear with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	 If dislocation occurs on the chest or up, you must note any movement and cannot hide it.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	 A reduction of dislocations is easy when a man is young and robust
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	 A reduction of his own body to the superior part
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	 Then you should place his limbs under a hook of iron and lift it to its upper part, then join the limb with force and courage to the back; and from there you will stretch out the limb towards itself: and at that point you will minister the hand as far upwards as possible.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	 Then he pulls it downwards or lifts it quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	 If he doesn't lift it as we have said and many dislocations occur at the beginning of this day: then let a warm bath be given to him who is suffering from pain or discomfort; and a soothing ointment should be applied which soothes and relieves the pain just like if one were to apply cold compresses to the head, feet, hands, and face.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	 Then he is placed on his back; and a hook of iron is placed under him and wool which is equally equal between the relief from pain and restriction is applied.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	 Then a doctor places his foot above the hook; he ministers the arm of the patient towards the lower part of his body.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	 And another minister holds the head of the patient so that it does not move towards the lower part; he himself then lifts up quickly.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	 And if it is easier to reduce him as we have said; then you should make an effort so that the limb of the patient who is longer and weaker will be brought down to one side where he can rest on his back: also place both of his arms under the hook of iron, and lift them towards the upper part until he has been supported by air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	 And another minister holds down the hand of the patient to support it in front of him; he himself then lifts up quickly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	 If the patient is weak or too tired to carry on with this reduction; then he should be supported by something else so that he can continue until a dislocation occurs quickly.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	 And the reduction is done according to another way; and it is like placing a long stick with a round head which fits into the hand of death; but not too large or thin
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	 Afterwards, after they have been placed on the head with a linen cloth and are removed from under it when they become heavy (because of their weight), the patient lies on the length of the staff.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Afterwards, his hand is extended towards the lower part while the other arm extends his body from another side with forcefulness; for this union brings him to his place of motion.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	 If his reduction is difficult by all that we have mentioned so far, then use this method of care; and it will be like lifting up a staff whose length equals the sum of two arms, its width equals four fingers, and its thickness equals twice the thickness of two fingers: if its head is round in order to prevent its entry into deep crevices by means of this shape.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	 Afterwards, linen cloth is placed over the rounded head so that it does not drag down the staff while moving.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	 Afterwards, they are placed under the staff and its hand is extended or upper arm is stretched up to it until below; then a cord is tied around the staff and both hands and arms.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	 Afterwards, upper arm is stretched to above until below; then the hand is extended downwards and the remaining body suspended from another side is released.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	 The union brings about its movement immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	 Afterwards, the entry of him is completed in any manner possible; then it is necessary to place under a sphere of linen equal quantities from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	 Afterwards, put on the prepared plaster made by mixing flour with water and olive oil; then place it all over his body as before was done.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	 Afterwards the binding of the linen plaster is done with a decent tie; then the band above the plaster is tied on as before was done; and his hand is attached to its collar so that it does not move for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	 And it should be necessary that the food of him who is ill is placed after he is comfortable; because its place is for his healing to happen.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	 After seven days at most, or five; and it is removed with motion
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	 If after that time there was no improvement, he has recovered.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	 If the joint is dislocated excessively due to moisture that happened to him or some other cause, then it must be treated with a cautery containing three holes; according to what was mentioned earlier in the chapter on cauteries.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	 If all this is done and the joint does not heal within seven days, it may be loosened or reduced with forceps; however if it will not loosen or reduce, then it dies off, and cannot be restored to its proper place: you know that the nerves of the arm are cut and can either be made straight again, stretched out, or relaxed.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	 The dislocation that happens due to the chest or nipple, or a reduction towards the back is treated with force and extension using the hands; until it is restored, then use the remaining restraint and care for its recovery.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	 If a gouty pain after the recovery occurs in any member and stiffness in its motion is treated with a strong bath many times until it relaxes and returns to normal; until then use restraint and care for its recovery
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	 Of the treatment of dislocations cubitis (upper limbs).
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter Twenty-eight.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	 You know that the joint of the upper limb may be dislocated with difficulty; and similarly it can be reduced with difficulty as well, in fact even more so; and this same joint is easily dislocated towards all parts, especially towards anterior or posterior.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	 And its dislocation will not be hidden to you because it is easily seen from below and from the touch, as dislocated in whatever form.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	 When you bring a dislocated upper limb together with one that is healthy, it will be clear to you
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	 The joint cannot be tightened up and cannot grasp or touch the lower arm with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 The patient should be positioned and immobilized immediately before the application of cold compresses
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	 If a hot poultice is applied to him first, his reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps he will not recover completely unless the poultice is immediately followed by cold compresses on the back
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	 The removal of dislocations generally worsens with pain; and many times it has descended along with this death.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 The restoration of him when it is possible to reduce him will be as follows: his hand should be extended with two other hands; and the physician's arm should be stretched above the cubit (about a person's height) and below, so that he may push himself back by pulling on both sides simultaneously, or by using the palm of his hand, until he reaches his place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	 Alternatively the dislocation may be reversed in this way: first he doubles his hand with his own, until he strikes on both sides simultaneously by using the palm of his hand which is dislocated; or alternatively it can be done by reversing its position so that it becomes an anterior dislocation when the palm is pressed against the dislocated cubit.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	 If the dislocation cannot be reduced then administer a strong and intense extension; it is as follows: two physicians should extend his arm with all their strength, so that they may not remove him while he extends himself.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	 Afterwards the arm should be returned to its whole length after it has been doubled over by means of a strap or a ligature.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	 When the physician strikes with his hand he also uses oil; so that this which is done with ease and lubrication may come into play as a remedy.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	 He then pulls himself back by pushing with great force until he reaches his place.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	 After the reduction of him is done he should be placed on a flat surface where there is stiffness; and with a warm bath and oil he should be warmed up until the tension is released and he can move freely without any restriction.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	 The arm is suspended at the level of the sickbed for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	 After that, he should be released.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	 "If a suture is firmly placed at its proper site, then immediately remove that ligature and let go.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 "If you are not able to firmly place the suture, then try again with a different ligature and remove that one later after some days or until it becomes firm.
Deinde solue ipsam.	 "And afterwards let go of her.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	 "If something goes wrong with the suture after reduction of the ligature and positioning has been made: then administer humectation in warm water, and also friction (rubbing), subtle friction (rubbing) gently, compression, until the line is taut or the ligature is tightened from above. Or you can place a small bird on top of the ligature.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	 "Then tighten it up and let go after one day and one night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	 "And afterwards remove her from there and put him back into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	 "When she is done bathing, then apply friction to the ligature gently with warmed water.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	 "Then repeat three times over her and into warm water until she becomes slack or relaxed.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	 "And if you are able to place a heated iron on top of her with oil and tension it up.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	 "Do this several times until she becomes slack or relaxed.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	 "Her line is loosened and she returns to her normal state of being.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	 "From the removal of a ligature by Almahassem.
Caput XXIX.	 "Chapter Twenty Nine: The Removal of Ligatures.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	 "Almahassem makes the hand loose by removing a ligature between the arm and the body.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	 "The reduction of his dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	 "In the case of failed ligatures.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	 "However it is necessary that the loosening of his dislocation should happen before he becomes loosened up completely or at a place where something hot can be put to reduce it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	 "And the reduction of his dislocation is in him as he puts a weak hand over a table and extends the assisting hand to him. And the physician places her own hand above it on top of the ligature and pulls it until she is done.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	 "However, one should keep in mind that when the hand has reached its end and begins to return towards the thumb: then place it on the inferior part of the hand with the palm upwards; and if there is dislocation which proceeds to the back of the hand, then put it (the dislocated hand) naturally into position over the table itself as an interior part placed above the table - so that the surgeon's hand may cover its own prominence by union.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	 If then it immediately returns to the correct position, that is good; but if not, then grasp it with the other hand holding a bandage and release it without repeating this error again.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	 If it cannot be tolerated or grasped after a day's use (after 24 hours), then the healing process continues according to its tortuosities; and nothing is harmed unless the hand softens up, and nothing can be grasped - you know that the thumb has been lost.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	 It therefore is no use to grasp it with eagerness towards its injury.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	 And perhaps not even this thing may happen.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	 When it does not immediately return to the correct position (when the hand is completely paralyzed), then place a plaster on top of its plaster as we did.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	 After that it should be grasped and released after 5 days; thereafter the hand is to be treated with a lotion and then released, and exercise done for its recovery.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	 If the movement of his hand becomes feeble and he falls ill from it: then gently grasp him with warm water and friction for a time until he is loosened.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	 Of the treatment of dislocations in the fingers
Caput XXX.	 Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	 When a finger is dislocated from the back of its palm or towards it (i.e., thumb-side), then extend the finger and press down on the dislocation with your other fingers until it becomes right again.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 After that, support its head and suspend it towards the dislocated part and release him after two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	 "Then hold him down and straighten him out so he is straight on his day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	 "When it was night, hold him according to the same pattern; do not let him rest on his day; and exercise him with movement; and hold him at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 "Do this for days until he becomes straight.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	 "And do the same with him if his arm is dislocated; and hold him at this side; and perform your first operation on him until he recovers.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	 "Do the same with him when his arm is dislocated to other parts as well.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	 "About the treatment of dislocations in the shoulder blade.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter thirty-one
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	 "When the shoulder blade is dislocated completely or has been moved out of place by many parts; then there's no treatment for it because death comes to him weakened.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	 "His sign is that ejection by weakness will not occur unless there's resistance; he cannot hold it, and many parts of him are falling out to some extent; or two bones from him, two arms from him, one bone from them, or the shoulder blade moves back into its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	 "Many parts become dislocated because many parts are pulled away to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	 "And the one that becomes dislocated at the back is called gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	 "Treatment of him is to consider when gibbosity comes from childhood; then there's no treatment for it at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	 "But the one that is dislocated from childhood or by force with many others; as they have said in long speech of treatments for them.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	 "It doesn't return to its place when it has been moved much.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	 "I am now going to release him from that with a bit of effort and care because he has been moved much by my proximity; I will bring out the instrument for this purpose in a different way than they did it before.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	 Therefore I say that what strikes off the front part is not an injury, nor healing from it
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	 And similarly to that which happens at two sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	 And not healed from these, unless the one that happens at the back in its own way, as I say: and it is, so extended becomes a weak over the face of his to the bottom equally, front and side: and extends under it the humid rope, so not hurt the breast of theirs.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	 Afterwards a straight piece of wood is fixed firmly into the foot on the ground at the extremity of the thigh, around its head; and another piece round its feet at the other extremity of the thigh: and it holds the wood, so that it is not fastened to the foot.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	 And hold the second one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	 Afterwards stretches above the head of a weak one and under its ear ligaments, tight: and extends to the bone which is near the head of him; and binds it on it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	 Afterwards strings a different ligament above its ankles, above its knees, at the elbows of theirs.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	 Afterwards gathers all ligaments and binds them to another wood which is near his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	 Afterwards extends all ministers to the head of a wood ligament, and two pieces are not removed from where they are fastened as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	 And the physician puts his palms on the spine with force until he expires or puts a tablet above it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	 Afterwards takes both feet onto the tablet until he expires.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	 If however it does not expire by this treatment, then take a tablet of whose length is around three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	 And the place at which we said that it is near to weakness, into where the edge of the tablet will go.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	 Afterwards puts an average sized tablet above the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	 And the physician takes both feet of his onto another edge.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	 "It is firmly held fast in place securely until the vertebrae are ready to be released.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	 "Then, if you're ready to operate with the aid of your other hand; and it is as though you are holding a staff that has two branches, one on each side of its head, at an angle equal to the length of one arm: and in his neck there will be two staffs.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	 "And the length of each staff is one palm's breadth; and it has been made at every place through which the arrow runs, so that a branch of wood may be laid down upon the ground everywhere.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	 "And there is a rounded arrow, from which the ligament has been removed through two of its holes.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	 "And at the end thereof is a hole into which a staff will be firmly fixed; its length being equal to that with which it was used.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	 "Then, after you have loosened the ligature that was on his neck with your other hand (which is at his head), loosen the ligatures from both of his legs through his thigh.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	 "Then he will administer the arrow that is bent with your hand and the ligature through which it was shot; and the physician will treat the vertebra as we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	 "This is the shape of the arrow that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	 "After you have treated the vertebra and made it equal to its place, then prepare an excitant with alum.
Deinde stuppam.	 "Then end.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	 "After that, place a star above the excitant made of alum with its length equal to three fingers or extending from them.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	 "Its length will be such as to cover the space between the vertebrae and above the healthy vertebra without injury.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	 "Then he will tie with it the ligature that we have mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	 "And feed him with a subtle nourishment until he recovers.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	 "When a wound has healed in its proper place:" then it is necessary that the medical remedies which have calmed down and relaxed be given out.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	 And when they are administered on top of the soaked linen,
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	 When a dislocation occurs at the end of the spine:" then it is necessary to perform the displacement and use the remedy that has already worked
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	 Therefore, it is not necessary for a treatment of this type to be applied when there is an attempt at self-preservation because such a treatment might cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	 Of the dislocation of the Ankh bones
Caput XXXII.	 Head Xii.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	 Note that the dislocation of the Ankh bones and the dislocation of the arm did not occur unless there was a displacement only, and they also didn't happen to those who experienced other dislocations far away from them or in conjunction with it.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	 The dislocation of the Ankh bones happens according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 This is because it is dislocated towards front and towards back
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 Furthermore, it happens the most that it is dislocated towards the inside: and least of all towards the front and towards the back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	 When the dislocation is towards the inside, then its care is as follows:" when you join together a sick body with an unwell one, it will be longer; and the leg of him who has had it will rise more than that which is healthy, and he cannot make his foot come back to its place in front because it was dislocated near the hip: and there is a location following behind the other's head, hot, therefore, so as soon as the coxae's head reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	 The mark of him who was dislocated towards the outside is that his accidents were contrary to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	 The mark of him who was dislocated towards the front is that his leg expanded when it came into contact with a healthy body and did not have two legs without pain in its knee; if he comes to walk, then he cannot come back to the place in front because it was dislocated near the hip: there will be urine held onto him, and his head turned backwards towards the other's head, and at walking he is held down on the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	 The dislocation of his finger happened to the posterior side, so that it cannot expand (open out), nor can he double-joint (touch) it before it is doubled by itself; and his thumb is short as well: and his little finger is also shorter than the other one; and his little finger has been made soft, and there is a small protrusion of his thigh at that place.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	 The reduction or restoration of the dislocated finger is as follows: if it is a fresh dislocation and has not yet healed with its possessor, then it must be reduced by someone else; but if already healed when possessed, no one may reduce or touch it except in its own place where it was dislocated.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	 Therefore if you administer the reduction to him and it remains according to his disposition, then at that time there is no one's care for it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	 Therefore, he should not be granted favor with a whip.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	 In that case where there is one dislocation and four fingers are dislocated, then the reduction should be applied to him in this way: you will close his joint (the finger), stretch it towards the interior and exterior; move his thumb and little finger from both sides; if he has reduced them himself, no other care must be taken for them.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	 If not done in this way then you must prepare a strong instrument and stretch his thigh from the lower part; either by using your hands or with some ligature that is tied above his thigh so as to reach under him, when he comes down upon him (the injured limb).  Another man extends his hand over him so it reaches under its own weight.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	 Then with the help of a ligature gently stretched from above his hip-bone, and holds onto the extremity of the other man's ligature.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	 And this extension is either towards the front of his thigh to the back of the pelvis or vice versa towards the back of the thigh to the front of the trunk.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	 And this extension will continue until he becomes weak in his own body and stops from falling (after reducing).
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	 Therefore the above mentioned are the specifications of the reduction or restoration of each finger separately, which is common to all four fingers.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	 "If then you have separated it as we said, this is good; but if not, then of course that thing which I speak about the maintenance of one's own body must be done.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 "Therefore, when his own part is separated for the inside (of a body), it is necessary that he be fed with what is healthy on both sides.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	 "Then the ligament is put over the root of the thigh bone, in that which lies between the top and bottom of it [the thigh], and the place that is beneath the buttocks.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	 "Then extend the ligament upwards from one side to the upper part of the body towards the higher part of the trunk, and towards the waist.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	 "Then takes a stronger hand for him [the patient], and places a thick mass of the thigh muscle below it, extending it outwards with a downward push.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	 "But I am returned to my place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	 "And this is the simplest of all the others [methods], how we reduce this member.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	 "But if it is lowered down upon you and will not go with you to the entrance as this [method] says, then it is necessary that two feet of the patient be held together simultaneously with a ligament of strength, gently, over both calcaneus bones, and above both knees; and its length should be proportional in quantity to four fingers of each hand: and the foot of the patient extended more than by double digits.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	 "Then is it held aloft over the head on a stick, which lies in the house; and its length should be proportional to two arms from below.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 "Then is the strong youth given to support the head of the thigh bone; and it is held aloft with one other patient, and urged on by another [youth], helping him to rise as he forcefully supports his side with strength.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	 "But when it is separated for the outside [of a body], then it is necessary that he be held by one who has great weight.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	 The ligature is placed above his foot and below his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	 Then two stakes are inserted: one under the feet of him and another under the top of his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then a third stake is added to the middle of his foot and firmly inserted there so that it supports any wet clothing he may wear; also a fourth stake is placed between his thighs so that it does not draw him towards the lower part when extended.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	 After this, all the surgeons turn to attend on their own parts; and then the physician applies his hand for reducing them manually.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	 If he recovers from the injury mentioned above, it will be a good thing.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	 And if not, place two stakes on his back and at both sides of him as we said for the other case equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 However, it is necessary that he lies flat upon his sound leg.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	 When the dislocation is to the front part of him then it is necessary that his leg be extended either by force or at once, and according to this same story above the foot; and the physician places on the right hand a palm of his own onto the injured shin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	 Then he is held together by both hands with the other one holding him extended towards the lower end of his leg.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	 If the dislocation is to the back part of him then it is not necessary that he be extended towards the lower end; and if placed on the ground may have his hands held above a hard thing as we said for holding him over two stakes, so that both arms are stretched out with his face turned upwards, also any dislocation at an angle from outside in must be treated according to what we said about how to hold him over two stakes.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	 It is necessary that a compression be administered with the stakes and also at whatever place the injury may occur; and the reduction must be done according to what we said before.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 The sign of the reduction should not be hidden from you; and it is necessary that you stretch both his legs, as he does himself, and when they are equal to each other, if he holds tight his foot and extends him without moving out of place: then you know that the member has been restored according to what we said before. Then embrace two thighs with a bandage tightly, and tie it so strongly that there is no chance for any part to move from above downwards; and hold him quietly on three or four days depending upon how he goes over his leg after this.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	 In that case, you would need to compare the leg with its opposite (the left one compared to the right one), and then align them so they are level; after which, if you see that they are equal in this state of alignment, then you know that dislocation has already occurred: thus, it is now a firm position. Therefore, the affected limb will not be able to walk any more.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	 If you see any softening or loosening of the ligament or joint, then compare it with its opposite (the left one compared to the right one), and then align them according to your first rule of thumb; and release that limb for three days as well.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	 In that case, after it has been aligned according to your first rule of thumb, make sure the affected limb is delayed from walking for three days; and only then will it get better.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	 On dislocations of the knee.
Caput XXXIII.	 Joint 33
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	 The knee joint can dislocate in three different ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	 It can dislocate outward, inward, and downward; or towards the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	 And it cannot dislocate toward the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	 Its mark of a dislocation is that his foot will be pulled towards its opposite knee.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	 If the foot does not hold with the other knee (the right one compared to the left one), then you know that the knee joint has dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	 The restoration of all the ways a dislocation can occur is to make sure that you support both knees equally; if possible, allow it to extend its leg towards what would be its back in order for them to meet and place your foot between their feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	 After that, support the affected knee with both of your hands; and then bring them across in front of each other between your fingers over the dislocated knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	 Then hold it down with two palms on both sides of its joint, firmly.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	 Another person will then extend the foot towards his knee; until he gets back into position.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	 The mark of restoration is that you support both knees equally without struggling too hard.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	 Then hold it down and align the affected limb with its opposite knee.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 "On days following injury, or four.
Deinde solue ea.	 "After [the] injury.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	 "But not until after some days has he begun to walk again
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	 "If you reject the reduction of his limb, then administer a strong stretch with ligatures as described above until he is cured.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	 "Of ankle dislocation cure.
Caput XXXIIII.	 "Chapter 40.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	 "The ankle is sometimes pulled away [in a sprain], and sometimes dislocated by the second part of its bone.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	 "And the dislocation of his foot may occur internally or externally.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	 "The sign [or characteristic] of this dislocation is that you see the foot inflated as it comes towards the part which is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	 "The cure of its removal [sprain] is easy to the restoration: and it is that you stretch with facility while holding hands, until he recovers.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	 "When dislocation occurs by the second part of its bone [ankle sprain], you must stretch him as if his leg is bent: and hold firmly on to it with the strong hand behind while holding onto the other hand at its posterior end.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	 "After that you hold his foot with your right hand to the top of it and with your left hand at its bottom part.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	 "Then you pull him towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	 "After that, while holding onto his foot with both hands.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	 "Then stretch it from the left side and pull upwards [with your right hand], without any effort to lift it up by yourself.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	 "Do that twice as we did before.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	 "Then pull his leg up to the top of it with a third stroke and you hold onto the hand holding the foot.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	 "If he has recovered from one stroke or two strokes as described [above], you have seen that the foot is cured and it was good; but if not, then make another application over him to see whether this will help.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	 "If you are prohibited from reducing it as described above," he [the patient] shall lie on his back with the head down to earth and fix a pillow on firm ground beneath him so that he may die between his legs.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	 "Then the physician shall receive it and after that he [the patient] shall lie on his side with one hand elevated or with a support above his knee using either of them as a bandage.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 "Then the physician shall extend all the ministers to counteract his [the patient's] natural flexion and fix a pillow between both legs so that his body is not pulled towards the lower side by flexion.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	 "Then he [the physician] shall equalize the motion of his hands and fix another minister on the healthy leg at its lowest point.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	 "A dislocation has been caused by a rupture.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	 "When a dislocation has occurred and declared to you the restoration of health then fix the splint and bandage it tightly with ligaments and tie the leg with a bandage tied to its knee.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	 "It is necessary that you fix the other foot as far back as possible on top of your heels so that there is no bandaging above them and they are allowed to lie down.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 "Then let him lie at rest for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	 "If the ligament becomes loose then fix it again and let him lie at rest for three or four days to prevent him from moving about for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	 "If he is unable to walk before this time has passed and the ligament becomes loose or is torn apart then let there be security that it does not occur again after this dislocation and is corrupted so that it does not receive care afterwards.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	 "If an illness of a cold hand occurs then you should administer to him the remedy that preceded our narration and anointing until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	 "Of the treatment for the dislocation of the foot.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 55.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	 "It is fitting that which moves from them with slight extension and little effort; this indeed is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	 If the dislocation occurs on some of the fingers of the hand or foot, then it is necessary to support that limb in its natural resting position, either on the ground (earth) or on a table; and it remains standing just like an ambulating person.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	 Then you place your own foot upon that which moves from those bindings.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	 After placing the foot on it with strength and endurance until it is released; after that its upper part will become equal to you (the patient) already and not protrude out of place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	 After placing both feet on the table which supports the whole foot with two hands together.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	 After tying it tightly in a straight and decent manner for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	 Then you loosen it, so that he may remain quiet from movement many days, until it is tied and secured by reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	 "In the case of dislocations or fractures.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter 36
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	 When anything happens to that, and the care of its restoration is undertaken by him who has been accustomed to long-use art of medicine, being merciful, slow, prudent in all his doings; he alone may sit upon the bed on which it rests, excepting one who is not prudent or patient.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	 Unless you are being led away by despair and grief with the burden of sorrow, and in which some relief appears from that distress.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	 So the care of its restoration is undertaken immediately at the beginning of things, before it happens to be cold [i.e., dead].
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	 If it is restored to health again in accordance with our wish then administer the remedy so as to cause it to stay on that which had agreed to become dry from ointment application.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	 If the dislocation is with fracture and separation of the bones occur then care for its elimination and make it so that which we have said in simple remedies from him who preceded them in those places
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	 As for you, by your virtue and on account of your protection against entering a fearful path, I shall guide you according to my teaching that has preceded this one.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	 That which is better for you before your Creator and more constant to your glory, and also a more lasting benefit for your body among those who are with you at that time.
