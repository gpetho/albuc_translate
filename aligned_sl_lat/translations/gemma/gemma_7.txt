After I have finished with you, my son, this book, which is the latest of my scientific works on medicine with the addition of this one, and has been completed in this way by the exposition of its contents and the declarations which are found in it, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise which is a part of the art of surgery, that is, surgery with the hand.
Since surgery with the hand is a new art in our time and at a remote period: until perhaps its science has perished and its trace has been erased: nothing remains of it except for slight descriptions in the ancient books, which have been altered by the hand: and thereby there has arisen error and hesitation, until its intentions have been closed and its scope extended: It seemed to me that I should bring together in this treatise, according to order, its positions and declarations, and its brevity: and that I should explain the forms of the instruments of cautery and other instruments of the art, together with their addition and preparation which is necessary
However, it is not possible to find a good artisan of this art with his hand in our time: because the art of medicine is long, and the author must exercise himself beforehand in the science of anatomy, as Galen has narrated, until he knows the movements of the limbs, their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, and lacerations, and the number of these things, and their emergence, and the pulsation of veins, and quietness, and the exit of places.
And for this reason Hippocrates said, that the name is much with the name, and little with the work, and especially in the art of the hand
We have indeed spoken of this at the beginning of this book.
For he who is ignorant of what we have said concerning anatomy will fall into error, and will thereby harm men. As for me, I have seen many who have learned of this science without study or experiment.
Since I have seen a stupid doctor attempt to remove a swelling from a woman's neck by cutting her arteries, and she died between his hands.
And I have seen another doctor who attempted to extract a stone from a patient's bladder, though the stone was large. He did this with the result that he extracted the stone along with the bladder itself And the man died on the third day.
And I myself was called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient that he would certainly die.
And I have seen another doctor who was paid by a certain Duke of our land for his medical skill: and it happened to a black slave who was with him, that he fractured his leg near his heel: and the doctor, with his ignorance, bound the fracture with nails and strong stitching, and did not allow the wound to drain.
And as a result the slave died according to his desires. Then he dismissed him after a few days, and commanded him not to move his ligament: and he remained like that until the swelling of his leg had gone down, and his foot and leg, and as a result he died.
I was called to him again: and I found him perfectly calm and free from pain
And indeed corruption was confirmed in the limb: and I could not restrain it
When the limb has ceased to suffer corruption, it is no longer liable to further damage.
When the limb has ceased to suffer corruption, it is no longer liable to further damage.
When the limb has ceased to suffer corruption, it is no longer liable to further damage. That is, because when the cancer is pure and black, it does not require any further support, except in the limb which will tolerate it, so that the whole of it may be cut off.
And thus, my son, you must know that an operation is divided into two parts: the one which is associated with health, and the one which carries the peril in various conditions.
And I am excited in every place in this book concerning the operation in which there is fear and terror
Therefore you must be cautious and discreet concerning this, and do not make any boasts or empty promises
Receive with humility the measure with attention and protection, and the sick with kindness and firmness, and use the better way for healing thanks to God to obtain lasting glory and praise: and banish the grievous anxieties which make you fear, so that there may be no hindrance to your faith and comfort
For in this world there remains only the glory of God, and the perfume in this life, and finally in the number of your souls.
Galen indeed has said concerning some of his admonitions. Do not be afraid of the black bile: do not speak evil of the physician
I have indeed divided this treatise into three chapters.
First Chapter.
First Chapter.
Second Chapter.
On section and perforation, phlebotomy and packing, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows and similar matters: and the whole chapter is arranged in the order of the instruments.
Third Chapter.
On restoration, and dislocation, and treatment of twisting, and similar matters: the chapter is arranged from the head down to the feet, and the order of the instruments
But before we speak of any operation, it is necessary to mention the quality of the dressings and instruments: and in what complexions it should be used
I say therefore, that the discourse concerning the quality of the cautery dressing and its name is a prolonged, subtle, scientific, and secret discourse.
And many wise men have spoken on this matter, and they have differed among themselves: and indeed little is to be gained from their discourses, fearing the length of the discourse itself
I say therefore, that the cautery is useful for all complexions, whether with material or without material: except for two complexions which are the hot complexion without material, and the dry complexion without material
In the hot and dry complexions with material they disagree. Some indeed say that the cautery is harmful in these matters. Others have said otherwise, namely that Cauterium is not suitable for wounds caused by heat and dryness: for the nature of fire is heat. It is unsuitable to heal wounds caused by heat and dryness with heat and dryness.
Others have said the opposite, namely that Cauterium makes an ointment in all wounds caused by heat and dryness, which happen in the bodies of men: for when you compare the body of a man and moisten it, to the nature of fire, you find the body of a man chilled.
And I myself have learned from experience that this is true
It is not enough to learn only from this sermon; one must also learn from experience the last exercise of the Cauterium course, and have recognized the diversity of the dispositions of men, and the causes and accidents of their wounds, and their speed
Except in the cases of the most delicate complexions, there is no fear of them: and especially in the case of cold and moist wounds For all the physicians agree on this: and they do not hesitate to use Cauterium on them.
And behold, the sons of Alexander say that the secret of the treatment of wounds by Cauterium with fire, and the benefit of it over Cauterium with burning medicine is because fire is simple, whose action does not extend except to the part that is cauterized: and it does not harm any other connected limb except for a slight burn
The medicines of burning have an action that extends beyond the part that is cauterized: and perhaps makes it difficult to heal the wound of the limb, and perhaps even causes death.
Fire, however, on account of its subtlety and the excellence of its substance, does not cause this [pain], unless it be excessive.
I have learned from experience, on account of the length of my service and study with art, and the position over truth of things: and because of this I am excused from the length of the speech.</start_of_turn>
And even if it is not permitted for this book of mine, I will declare a secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in the bodies of its expulsions, which expels ailments with a philosophical demonstration that agrees with the minds of the learned.</start_of_turn>
And know this, my sons, that they themselves dissent in the time when it is necessary to make a cautery, and they say that it is better to leave it alone.</start_of_turn>
And I say that a cautery is useful in all times: for in fact the document [of the ailment] is absorbed by the fat at the time of healing, which is attracted by the cautery.</start_of_turn And especially if the cautery is for necessary and strong pains, fasts, which do not tolerate delay: for they fear the fire, which brings about greater harm than the slight damage done by the ailment itself.</start_of_turn
Do not let the minds of the learned or the sons think that because of this it is not useful, except for madmen and foolish doctors, for the ailment which is healed by a cautery is not always cured: they take this for consequence, and it is not so: for a cautery is not, except in the case of medicine, which alters the complexion and dries humors which are the causes of the ailments.</start_of_turn>
Truly, a cautery surpasses medicine by its speed of action, the excellence of its operation, and the certainty of its mastery: and it is possible that the ailment will be cured at some later time according to the complexion of the patient, the location of the ailment, and the excellence of the treatment: and that which is prepared in his body from the collection of superfluous humors in it: and that which comes to him from the cause itself, except in the case of an ailment in which a cautery is administered.</start_of_turn>
Acute pain in a limb with few supernumerary hairs and moisture, like the cautery of a tooth, because of pain, and similar to it, is possible that it will not return in that place because of the pain. However, this is in few cases.</start_of_turn>
Indeed, the saying is correct: the cautery of a tooth is the last remedy in medicine. It is the correct thing to say: because they believe that there is no cure that can be compared with medicine, neither with anything else after the cautery.</start_of_turn>
However, the thing is contrary to this, and the intention that the cautery is the last remedy in medicine is not true, except when we administer other modes of treatment for some ailment, and these do not yield: then we administer the cautery at the end, and it yields. It is thus that the cautery is the last remedy, not in accordance with the intention as the vulgar people and the multitude of doctors understand it.</start_of_turn>
The ancients said that the cautery with gold is better than the cautery with iron: and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold, and the fineness of its substance: and they said that it does not form pus at the place of the cautery.</start_of_turn However, this is not absolutely true: for I have seen this to be the case, and I have found that it does not cause this in some bodies without other things.</start_of_turn>
And the cautery with the substance itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.</start_of_turn However, when you burn the cautery with gold in fire, you are not to declare that this is the case when you ignite it according to the quantity you desire, because of the redness of the gold: and when it approaches the substance itself and if you add more fire to it, it liquefies in the fire, and turns into leaves.</start_of_turn
Why does the artificer depart from that to engage in this occupation? And because of this, Cauterium with iron is used by us more quickly and closer to the operation, from its rectitude to the operation.
I have also set out this Chapter on Cauterium, following the chapters: and I have set them out from the head to the feet: so that they may satisfy anyone who desires something from it.
Chapter II
Here is the cauterization is performed with regard to the lord of humidity and frigidity over the brain: which are two causes of swelling, and of the multitude of flows of humors from the head downwards to the eyes and ears, and of the multitude of sleep, and pain of teeth, and pain of the throat: and generally all ailments which arise from frigidity, such as palsy, swelling, epilepsy, apoplexy, and the like of these ailments.
The method of cauterization is as follows: immediately when the patient arrives with the disease, along with a physician who uses a soothing solution, the head should be bathed three or four nights, according to the nature of the disease, and the age of the patient, and his custom
Then command him to make a circle with his hand over his head with the nail. Then make him sit between your hands which are placed square, so that your hands rest on his chest
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes Wherever his middle finger points, that is the place where the cautery is to be applied with the flame
Then apply the Cauterium with Olive Oil: which is like this in shape
Then place it over the marked place with the cautery, descending slowly, so that your hand is gradually constrained, and you withdraw it. Then draw your hand quickly and grasp the place.
If you see that some part of the bone has been broken by the quantity of the head of the ulna, or by the quantity of the herb, then draw your hand again And if not, draw your hand again with the iron itself, or with something else which is cold: until you see the bone which I told you of
Then take something of salt and dissolve it in water, and soak in it the bottom, and put it over the place: and leave it for three days.
Then put over it the soaked bottom in butter, and leave the bandage over the place until the eschar is consumed by fire. Then care for it with unguents of four herbs, until it is healed.
I have said that the more the wound is open, the more pus it emits: which is better and more useful.
And some of them say that the skin should be cauterized until the bone is reached: and keep the Cautery firm, until something of the thickness of an ossificated bone is burned
Then loosen that which has been burned from the bone, and then heal it.
And others say that it is necessary that when the cautery is finished it should leave an imprint in the bone like a footprint, so that the bone will be broken: or an instrument which women put inside the small letter: and they say that from this place steam of the head arises, and the wound is opened for a long time
Then it cares until it is consolidated.
Then it cares until it is consolidated.
And discharge it; it is better for me that way with the health of the patient.
The head weakens from the resolution of its natural continuity: as we have seen in other limbs: and especially when the head of the patient is weak by nature: the first kind of cauterism is the most safe and good for me, and that is what I shall use: for I work with it for the health of the patient.
Head Chapter III.
When in the whole head there occurs a chronic pain: and it persists in the patient, and there is heat, and swelling, and purulent discharge, and oil, and application of things like these And especially if it has already been cauterized once with that which we have mentioned, and nothing more is added to it: then consider it For if the head of the patient is strong in nature and not weak, and there is cold that comes upon it: then cauterize with another cautery under that little one Then cauterize it over all the corners of the head with the cautery, so that it does not go through the skin, and uncover the quantity of bone from which we have spoken. And cauterize it once with the cautery in the nape of the neck in the place which is called the uas: and it is the place where the wind is placed: and raise your hand up in this, and do not uncover the bone The patient is relieved because of that cold which comes upon it, and different from the pain of other cauteries of the head in general
And I say this concerning the Cauterium: it must be that the Cauterium be such that it may cauterize the horns of the head and the back of the head more finely, while it cauterizes the middle of the head.
Chapter III.</start_of_turn
When in the part of the head there is pain and swelling, or if the pain extends up to the eye, and it is driven out with medicinal poultices, and other treatment is administered as I have said in the discourse on diseases, and it does not suffice: then cautery is done in two ways: either with acute burning medicine or with the iron.</start_of_turn
But as for cautery with acute burning medicine, you take a piece of wood about the size of a barleycorn, and burn it until it is red hot, and then you touch the diseased area with the burnt end.</start_of_turn Then cut the area of pain at the same time as you perform phlebotomy on the side, until there is a bubble under the skin where the tooth is caught.</start_of_turn
Insert it into the wound until it reaches the bone: then bind over it with a bandage of moderate constriction, and leave it in place for fifteen hours. Then remove the dressing and give the wound two or three days’ rest. Finally, apply a wet compress over the wound until the pain has gone away.
And if you wish to do it with some of the burning medicines which I have written about in the twelfth tractate on Burning Remedies.</start_of_turn
Burning of the veins with iron is according to this method. Burning with iron is performed in this manner
It is called Clavicle because its form is like that of a key, in which there is a slight curvature, and in the middle there is a small protrusion.
Then place it upon the place and hold your hand: and slowly draw the iron away with the amount that has been scorched from the thickness of the skin, like half of it And lift your hand so that the artery below does not burn and the blood flow does not increase
Then soak the area in salt water, and place it upon the place, and leave it for three days: then place the area with butter: afterwards care with unguent until it has healed
And if necessary, burn the haematoma with the second degree of the cautery iron. Burn from the incision of the artery in this haematoma, not directly over it.
In the old way, cautery was performed by opening the haematoma.
When you have treated the haematoma, when the swelling has subsided from the treatment we mentioned before, and the cure has not taken hold: and if you notice swelling which the first or second cautery with medicine or with fire did not cure, then you must burn the cautery iron with a knife until the sign of pain disappears on the place, which is as long as half of a finger, or like that: and hold your hand firmly until you have pierced the artery, and keep it like that until you reach the bone.
It is necessary to check for any possible cause of jaw displacement, which may occur during mastication, to prevent its becoming flattened or its nerve being damaged, from which spasm arises.
This action must be taken with great caution, and the haemorrhage of the artery must be arrested cautiously. For in its division there is fear, especially for him who is ignorant of what he is doing, and is not skilled or experienced: and he abandons the operation at once
And I will remind you of the regimen of the flow of blood which is accidental to an artery according to its custom, and in its place is found in this book of mine
If the fever from the illness does not suffice for this Cauterium, and the patient's body tolerates Cauterium in the middle of the head, as we have mentioned, take care of the wound, until it is healed
If you wish, apply Cauterium as we said in the chapter on the extraction of an artery with Cauterium which has two blades. For Cauterization is better than excision and more effective
Concerning the method of Cauterization in the pain of the Ears.
When it happens in the Ear that there is pain from cold, and it is cured with poultices, and the rest of the treatment which we have mentioned previously, and the pain is not relieved, then apply Cauterium: and this is called the Punctum, which has this shape
Then make the Punctum after you have ignited it around the whole Ear, as it is rolled around: or around both, if there is pain in both. And prolong thee with the Cauterio from the root of the ear towards the parumper, after you have marked the place with the encaustro: and let the quantity of the Cauterio be ten points in every aure, and so on.
And then care for the place until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
In this way cauterize in the Tortura.</start_of_turn>
Chapter VII.</start_of_turn
A burn which can be cured by cautery is not except from those which arise from phlegmas, as we mentioned in the discussions of the causes of diseases.</start_of_turn
And you must cauterize the species which arise from exication and spasm of the nerve.</start_of_turn
When you have cured this species of torture with baths, and purging, and gargling, and the cure does not suffice, then it is necessary to cauterize the diseased three times with the Cauterio: once at the root of the ear, and the second a little lower from the ear, and the third at the junction of the two lips.</start_of_turn
And put the Cauterio on the side opposite the diseased part.</start_of_turn For the softening does not take place except in the part which appears healthy.</start_of_turn
And the form of cautery is that you cauterize the Cauterio itself at the root of the outer ear under the corner of the ear a little: and the other at the temple: the length of which is as long as the thumb.</start_of_turn And hold your hand with the Cauterio until the quantity of the middle third of the thickness of the skin is consumed.</start_of_turn
And this is the form of the Cauterio, and it is like a knife whose form is shown above: indeed it is not finer than that of an awl: and it is necessary that the knife be of a suitable thickness.</start_of_turn
Then care for the place where it preceded: until it is healed.
Then care for the place where it preceded: until it is healed.
When the old apoplexy has passed, and you are treating it as we have said, and no medicine helps it, and the patient does not have a fever, then burn him with four burns over all the horns of his head, and burn in the middle of the head, as we have said, and burn in the nape of the neck, according to what preceded: and the manner of burning should be according to what preceded.
Then care for the place where it preceded: until it is healed.
Then care for the place where it preceded: until it is healed.
Then care for the place where it preceded: until it is healed
It is necessary that in the first instance in the sick man a large dose of hyra, and mild pills for the brain be given.
Then care for the place where it preceded: until it is healed
Then care for the place where it preceded: until it is healed
Then care for the place where it preceded: until it is healed Then care for the place where it preceded: until it is healed
Then care for the place where it preceded: until it is healed
If, however, you desire to make an addition, and the patient is able to tolerate it: then make for him a Cauterium in the middle. If you desire to make an addition: then cauterize it over two horns.
Then care for it until it is healed: and let the Cauterium be applied according to its form, as is prefixed.
As to the cauterization of Paralysis, and the softening of it.
Chapter X.</start_of_turn>
You must proceed in the softening of the head with urine, and with that which we have mentioned.</start_of_turn>
Then touch the head of the patient: afterwards make a Cauterium in the middle of the head, and a Cauterium over every horn of the head, and a Cauterium over the back of it, and three over the spines of the neck.</start_of_turn>
If, however, you find in the softening of the body of the many of these, and the patient is able to tolerate it, and the sickness is strong: then make for him four Cauteriums over the spines of the back, and the last one with a Cauterium, until it is burnt from the surface of most of it, and lift up your hand.</start_of_turn Then care for it until it is healed: and thus apply the Cauterium.</start_of_turn
How to cauterize in Epilepsy.</start_of_turn
An epileptic patient is not cauterized, except for him from whom the epilepsy is from phlegm.</start_of_turn
You must therefore soften his brain in the first place with urine, and with the rest of the cure which we have mentioned: when the patient is great, or is tolerant in accepting the medicines.</start_of_turn
If, however, a boy endures not medicines, then gargarisma is administered, and nourishing bites which temper the brain, many days before with advantage to the food.
Then the head is bandaged, afterwards it is cauterized with one cautery in the middle of the head, as it has been before in this manner: and with another cautery on the nape of the neck, and over all the corners of the head with a third cautery.</start_of_turn> If the patient is strong and tolerates, then cauterize with cauteries which have been mentioned in those with paralysis, and softening of the body over the cervical vertebrae and the vertebrae of the back: and let the Cautery be of olive oil according to the manner which has been mentioned.</start_of_turn>
If the patient is a boy, then apply a mild cautery according to this manner.</start_of_turn>
Regarding the method of cauterizing in melancholy.</start_of_turn
When the cause of melancholy is corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize with the cauteries which we mentioned in those having paralysis.</start_of_turn
And if the cause of melancholy is excess of moisture descending to melancholy, and the body of the patient is wet, then give him something to drink which will temper the brain, as has been mentioned previously: then bandage the head of the patient, and make immediately after a pendant tortellum which is made from linen, like a circle.</start_of_turn
Then place it in the middle of the head: and the patient sitting upright is to be held from all sides.</start_of_turn
Then apply liniment.</start_of_turn It is more worthy from the old butter. Heat it over a moderate fire until it becomes warm to the touch, as much as the finger can bear when it is introduced into it. Then evacuate it into the middle of its head in a circle, and keep it there until it has cooled down.
Do this every week to the sick person along with the rest of his treatment, until he is healed
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small punctures on its surface, besides which you must keep the hand firm with the cautery: it will give off an odor.
For this kind of cautery moistens the brain with its quality.
Then put on it a cover soaked in butter, or fat from a hen
In descending water concerning the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When the water of the eye is declared by the signals I mentioned before, then begin to instill it and give the patient a drink, along with which it will temper the head of the patient.
And keep it away from all moistness, and let him sit in a bath for a few days.
Then order him to turn his head and cauterize it in the middle of his head Then cauterize it over two tempora with two cauteries, if there is an incipient recession of the water in both eyes simultaneously: or from one side only, if there is an incipient recession of the water in one eye only: and cut away with the cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin: and let there be cauteries in their length in the width of the temples: and burn from the flow of blood.
If you see that something has happened from this, then immediately cut it off with whatever medicine is available: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting off of them, and the precautions against the flow of blood.
And when it is cauterized on the surface of bone under two ribs, two cauteries must be made at the end of it
In the ancient lacrimal glands, in this way cauterize.
When the tears of the eyes are ancient, they are sticky: and they are over the nails, and the arteries which are in the manifest head outside, it is verified that this is from the superfluousness of cold, phlegmatic: then cauterize with the same cautery which I mentioned in the beginning of the descent of water, the cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries over two temporal regions, and two cauteries on the surface under two ribs And if the addition is not digested, then cauterize it in all the side of the eye cautiously over the eyebrow with a small cautery
In the manner of cauterizing the nose in the foetore.
When you are treating this, with what we have said in the discourse, and the medicine does not help: then cleanse, and give in the drink of the patient three nights: then shave its head, and cauterize it with the middle cautery, with olive oil cautery. Then cauterize it with the claw cautery with two cauteries, over two superciliums under the hair a little bit
And guard the artery, so that you do not cut it off.
This is the shape of the Clauilis cautery.
And this is the form of the Clauilis cautery.
When the Palpebra of the eye is softened by brittleness or moisture: then cauterize the Palpebra with one cautery, like a lunar cautery.</start_of_turn>
And if you will, cauterize the upper two eyelashes a little more than two cauteries at a time: and stretch them out for two times: and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyelash: and do not bring your hand too close to the cautery, but according to the quantity which is to be cured of the third of the Palpebra.</start_of_turn
Chapter XVI.</start_of_turn>
There are two ways of cauterizing the eyelashes: with fire or with a burning medicine.</start_of_turn
But in the cautery with fire, command the patient to be beforehand that he expel his hair, if there are any which are moving, until they are prolonged and equal.</start_of_turn If however they are burned at the root: then hold his eyes closed with the thumb and the index finger, so that they do not move, until they are burnt.</start_of_turn
When they are burnt and equal, then put the patient's head in your lap: then mark over the Palpebra of his eye with charcoal, a sign which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the sign be near the eyelashes.</start_of_turn
Then place the soaked cushion in albumin or: on the mucus of the hair above the eye.
Then apply the cautery, which is shaped like this
Then burn over the outline, which you will mark gradually in many veins, until the surface of the skin is burned, which is like the shape of a leaf of Myrtle, throughout
And the sign of the success of your work is: if you touch the eyelash of the eye with your hand, and pluck the hair at the point of the eye.
Raise your hand then: and let it go in three days.
Then place above it the cushion with butter, until the pus is eradicated. Then care for it with unguent until it heals.
If some hair remains after an hour, and you soften the eyelash: then burn the cautery once more in the same place as before
If they are in the lower part: then burn the cautery there, until they are raised to their natural place: and make sure that the eyelashes do not burn the eyes
Just as with the principal diseases, that it sends away the hair, until it is prolonged and equalized Make from paper in the form of a leaf of Myrtle
Then take from the soap which has been boiled, and from the unsoaked heel of a garment a weight of about an ounce or almost as much: then mix these things together with good contrition, and make it with a fine motion, so that it does not become cold. Then take from the pan from which you took the charcoal and put it over the parchment which you have made like the form of a myrtle leaf, and put it on the eyelid of one eye, or two. Put under the eye a piece of cotton soaked in vinegar: and the head of the patient should be in your lap.</start_of_turn>
Put your finger on the doctor's chest and press it lightly.</start_of_turn> And you should move it whenever the patient feels the biting of the medicine: for its biting is like fire.</start_of_turn>
While you are doing this, you will have found out the biting of the medicine; then take away the medicine and move it with your finger.</start_of_turn> When the biting has subsided, then take away the medicine and wash the eye with water.</start_of_turn
Consider then, if the eyelid is swollen, whether it swells up with contraction like fire, or like an incision, is good: and if not, then repeat the medicine upon the place where the medicine does not touch, without injuring it, until your operation is complete and the eye is healed.</start_of_turn>
Then put upon it a piece of cotton with butter, until the skin of the swelling has disappeared.</start_of_turn Then care for it with an ointment of diaphanicon, or something else, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And it is necessary for you during the operation, to keep an eye on the last thing, that nothing of the medicine should fall into the eye.</start_of_turn
For if the eyelid becomes softened after a day, and something from the hair gets into the eye, then repeat the medicine upon the place where the eyelid softens of itself, as you did at the beginning.</start_of_turn> Then care for yourself until you are healed.
This is the form of the myrtle leaf.
You know that the eyes of men differ in size and shape Therefore consider this: do not conceal the rightness of this art which is its study
Concerning the cauterization of the fistula of the tear duct
When you have treated the fistula and it does not yield to your care: then it is necessary to cauterize it according to this method.
Command the patient to place his head on your lap, and hold his head between your hands in such a way that it does not move or shake with his head
Then put a soaked sponge in the eye of the sufferer, or in the mucus of his eyelashes over his eye: then apply the Cautery, which is of this shape.
Hold it concave, like the shape of a penknife whose handle is cut off at one end, as the Cautery is: and if it is penetrating too far, or if it is too high, do so with care
It is better to do this concave than flat
Then express the fistula, if it is open, and remove the pus from it, and dry it: and if it is not open, then open it and remove its pus.
Then put on the Cautery again, which is now lit cold.
And hold your hand alongside the Cautery from the eye to the part of the nose, so that your hand does not slip or move the patient: and place the Cautery on the fat of the eye and burn it through
If, therefore, you keep the Cauterium close to the bone from the beginning, it will be well. If not: then repeat the Cauterium once or twice if you find it insufficient: and leave it off for three days.
Then place the bandage with butter, and care for it with an exicator until it heals
If for forty days it has not healed: then place above it an acute corrosive medicine, until the bone is exposed: and do the same as is stated in the chapter itself
And there is another method for Cauterizing fistulas, which some of the first men have said. Direct it to the place of the fistula, and find it: then place under the opening of the fistula a thin cushion, that is, a needle of a thin kind, whose form is like this. And pour into it the quantity of lead which is equal to a drachma, liquefied, and keep your hand firm with the needle securely retained, and do not move the patient in any way, so that it does not run or cause the liquefied lead to go into his eye
And it is necessary to place above the eye of the patient a bandage soaked in albumin or in water.
The lead will burn away the place of the fistula, and will heal it with a miraculous healing.
When the fistula is healed, with what we have said of the Cauterium and the care, that is good. And if not: then it is necessary to administer a nasal opening and reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what is stated in its own place
Regarding the cauterization of fissures of the lips.
Many wounds occur in the lip, which are called "Pili," and especially in the lips of children.
When you are treating these wounds, when you have done what we said in the instruction about treating ailments, and the cure has not helped, then you must burn the little wound with a small knife, according to this shape
And let the cavity of it be according to the sharpness of the knife
Then put the burning fire quickly into the wounds, until the cauterium has reached the depth of the wounds.
Then care for it with the cautery until it is healed.
And in the fistula of the mouth you should cauterize with greater caution.
When swelling occurs in the root of the tooth, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then it makes pus, and swells up: afterwards it becomes black, and pus comes out, and a fistula is formed: then you must treat it, and do not be deceived by the cure, then you must burn with the cautery according to the quantity that is in the fistula. Then put the burning fire into the cavity of the fistula, and hold your hand, until the iron is burnt through to its depth, and its end: do this once, or twice at most
Then care for it afterwards, as we said about the treatment, until it is healed
If therefore it breaks, and is healed, it is good. And if not, then it is necessary to remove the place, and take out the corrupted bone according to what comes to light in its head
On how to cauterize in the Gingiues and soften teeth.
When softened by moisture, the gums swell and move the teeth. Then put the patient's head in your lap.</start_of_turn>
Then burn the cautery, whose shape will follow, so that you can put a gauze over the tooth: and introduce the burning cautery into it quickly. Keep your hand away from the patient, until he feels the heat of the fire reach the root of the tooth.</start_of_turn
And lift your hand away. Then repeat the cautery several times, as you wish.</start_of_turn
Then let the patient rinse his mouth with salt water, and keep it for an hour: and then spit it out.</start_of_turn
The tooth will then be firm, the gums softened and stretched, and the corrupted moisture will dry out.</start_of_turn
On how to cauterize for toothache.</start_of_turn>
When the toothache comes from cold, or from cold or from worms, and the cure is not helpful with the physicians: then burn the cautery in two ways: either with butter or with fire.</start_of_turn
The butter must be taken whole, and the cautery must be burnt with the butter in a pan or on a tile.</start_of_turn Then take cotton and put it over the end of the tooth.</start_of_turn Then immerse the affected part in boiling butter: and place the part upon the painful tooth quickly, and hold it firmly until it cools: then repeat the process several times, until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Or if desired, immerse wool or cotton in cold butter and place it upon the painful tooth: and place upon it a burning iron until the fire reaches the depth of the cavity of the tooth.
The cautery of the same with fire is to be done so that the air canal or the iron tube is opened. And let there be something of bulk in the body of the tooth, so that the fire does not penetrate too deeply into the bone of the diseased tooth
Then burn the cautery in the shape that pleases you: and place it upon the cheek of the tooth: and hold your hand firmly until the cautery cools down.
Do this several times, for the pain will vanish, or in the same day, or on another day.
And it is necessary to press the cautery into the impression, so that it may fill the diseased bone with good butter, and hold it for an hour: then expel it.
This is the form of the cautery
Burn with whatever extremity you like, according to what is possible: and this is the form of the tube.
In this manner the cautery is to be performed on the molars.
When the molars are affected by phlegm, and by cold humors, and do not yield to medicines, and you wish to speed up their digestion: then burn the cautery with a cavity, which is of this shape
Having two open extremities, like smoke escaping from Cauterium from the other limb: place the flame on the latter and, if it does not suffice, continue until it reaches the depth of the cavity.
If the cavity is small: then place Cauterium according to the size of the cavity.</start_of_turn>
Then remove the flame after three days and place above it an ointment of butter, until the burnt area has subsided.</start_of_turn>
Then care for the area with tooth unguents until it has healed to its original shape.</start_of_turn>
In the case of raised veins or constricted windpipe.</start_of_turn
When moisture accumulates on the windpipe, and especially when it is accompanied by cold of complexion, then it is necessary to evacuate the patient at first with the physicians' solutions.</start_of_turn
Then burn in the shadow at the root of the gullet in a depressed place: and burn carefully, so as not to reach the gut or the skin, except for what is necessary.</start_of_turn
Then burn again with another Cauterium at the junction of the neck at the end of its last rib: and let the Cauterium be blunt according to the manner which preceded.</start_of_turn
Then care for the area which has preceded until it has healed.</start_of_turn
In the case of pulmonary abscesses and tumors.</start_of_turn
When there is cough and pulmonary congestion caused by cold moisture, and the patient has neither fever nor phthisis, nor old consumption: then burn with two Cauteriums above the rib in depressed places, on the cartilage, on the bone.</start_of_turn And the cautery is applied in the middle of the chest between two nipples: and let the cautery be according to the shape which preceded.
And if you wish the cautery to be punctate with the cautery, which is called Punctum, whose shape preceded in the puncture of pain of the ear: and let there be punctures from thirty punctures up to almost as many
Then care for yourself with that which preceded, until it is healed.
And let the cautery be of three branches: according to this shape Because it alleviates with this when you do it with three Cauteria at once.
Chapter XXVII.</start_of_turn>
When the head of the adductor is displaced by the cause of humidity, and does not return to its place in an hour after displacement, until it has become accustomed to the repetition of the displacement, then it is to be displaced by a slight movement which happens as we have testified above; then it is necessary to reduce the displacement in the first place.</start_of_turn> Then the patient is laid down on his back, or on his sound side.</start_of_turn Then raise the skin which is in the interior of the Titillico towards the upper parts with your left hand: and if the dislocation has gone inwards.</start_of_turn
Then take two cautery needles.</start_of_turn Whose shape is this.</start_of_turn
Then cauterize the skin until it pierces through to the other side, and the figure of the cautery will appear with four cauteries.</start_of_turn
And when a cautery is made with a cautery having three hairs, thereby the figure of the cautery is made six cauteries: and the hairs are taut according to their substance.
This is the form of a cautery having three hairs.
And when one is added above in this way, thereby there are eight cauteries.
Then place over the cautery salt-covered pork-skins. Then make the patient adhere quietly, so that the limb does not move at any time, until it is comfortable
And if displacement has gone up, and this is rarely the case, then cauterize it above the elbow with a needle cautery, or with multiple punctures
For the joint is closed and moisture is expelled: and the patient is healed
In this way the stomach is cauterized.
When cold and much moisture happen in the stomach, until you take it out from its complexion, and multiply blisters to it, and apply diligent means of treatment, and do not confer: then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, extend his limbs, and move his hands Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery under the breastbone measuring the quantity of one finger with a needle cautery, and two cauteries below from the two sides of one cautery, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular And lengthen between each one so that they do not join, when pus is made
And the depth of the cautery is the quantity of two-thirds of the thickness of the skin
And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish to cauterize a great cauterium in the middle of the stomach according to this form: let there be a cauterium which is like this one according to the figure of a circle according to this form.
And let the stomach be cauterized by puncturing it with that which returns from this cauterium: and it is that the signs over the stomach be punctured according to quantity, as much as you wish with the incisions: then cauterize the same with the cauterium of the puncture: then care for the same with care, which preceded until it is healed.
In this manner let the cautery of the liver be cold.
When it happens in the Epate that there is pain from the cold and humidity, or from great windiness, until it departs from its natural composition by excessive evacuation, and the patient is cured, as we have said, and does not suffer in this: then it is necessary that the patient be placed upon his bed, and signs be made three cauteries according to this form and this quantity over the lower Ep from the underbelly, where the cubit of a man reaches: and let there be space between every cauterium according to the thickness of a digit: and let the cauterium be according to the length of the body rectum: and do not press your hand too much with the cauterium much.</start_of_turn>
And let the quantity of the latter be that which is absorbed from the thickness of the skin, the middle quantity of it not being added: and let the patient stand on his feet.</start_of_turn>
If he is not standing, then let him be lying down, who has extended his limbs and raised his arms.</start_of_turn
This is the form of the cautery.
It is also possible to use these needles for cautery with the knife cautery, when there is subtlety and skill in the art.
Beware lest you go too far with the cautery, and burn the whole skin, for the body is thereby burned throughout, and it reaches the intestines: for the skin there is thin, as you know well.</start_of_turn>
Regarding the cautery of the posterior portion of the liver.</start_of_turn>
When the exitus [of blood] occurs, and you wish to write, if that [area of] the apostema is in the liver flesh, or in its covering: if it is in the liver flesh, there is dull pain and swelling without sharpness: and if it is in the liver covering, with sharp pain and swelling: know that it fatigues the physician to care for it.</start_of_turn
Therefore let the patient lie over his bed.</start_of_turn Then the figure of the place of the apostema with the cautery: then ignite the cautery which is absorbed by the heat.</start_of_turn This is its form.</start_of_turn And cauterize with that one cautery until the whole skin is burned, and it reaches the spleen, until all the blood is gone: then take care of the care of the bleeding, until the patient is healed.</start_of_turn
It is not appropriate for anyone to perform such cautery except one who has studied the art of medicine for a long time, and who has experience of these things: for otherwise, you will hear of such an operation.</start_of_turn
It is better for her to depart from me.
In the case of cauterization of the pleura.
They say the ancients, when cauterizing the cold pleura with aristolochia roots, did it in this fashion And it is that you take some dry aristolochia roots, cut one of them in length equal to the thickness of a finger Then plunge it into oil and light the thing in the fire. And with one cautery, under the angle of the collarbone, and with two smaller cauteries under the guidance of little incisions to the part under the beard
And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly towards the back: and with one cautery in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach And three cauteries from behind: one in that which is between two ribs: and two cauteries from both sides of the chest, the lower cautery being between two ribs
And you must not press your hand with the cautery, but rather that it should smell openly from the skin.
And some of the ancients say that there are men who make use of a cautery like a nail of iron: they burn and then put it inside the body between the ribs, until it is expelled along with the thing to which it was applied, and it comes out whole: just as we said concerning the apposition of the liver
But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear that either the patient will die immediately or that a fistula will form in the place of the cautery, which will not heal.
How to cauterize the spleen of the head.
When you are treating a spleen ailment, as we have mentioned in the treatise on the treatment of ailments, and the treatment does not confer healing, then cautery is to be used in this [case] according to three methods, all of which are correct.
One of them is to make three or four cauteries in line along the length of the spleen according to the shape of the cautery for the liver, which precedes this figure.
And let there be between every two cauteries the thickness of a finger, or less.
And let the method of cautery be as we have mentioned for the cautery of the liver
Do not press your hand with the cautery: let the patient lie recumbent above his back
And another method of cautery is to make the cautery with two handles like that which we mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus: and raise the skin which is over the spleen directly above the patient's elbow: and raise your arm as high as the patient's body, so that the cautery will fall along the length of the body
Then insert two handles of the cautery which are lit on one side until the fire penetrates the skin from the other side: then withdraw the cautery: four cauteries will be made thus.
And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery which has three handles.
Then care for the cautery after you have finished using it: let it emit pus for several days: for that is more effective than any other method which has preceded it in the treatment.
How to cauterize in hydropathy
The cautery does not fall into Hydropsism, except as the proper ascleptics do.
When you are treating Hydropsism with the methods of treatment which we have mentioned in the preceding discourse, and the treatment does not suffice, then it is necessary to cauterize the four cauteries around the navel, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, and two behind the ribs between the vertebrae, and one in the middle of the chest, and one in the middle of the abdomen: and the quantity of depth of the cautery should be proportional to the thickness of the skin
Then draw out the cautery slowly, so that pus may be emitted over a long time.
And do not remove the patient from the treatment after the cautery: because it is necessary to combine two intentions with it: and it will quickly recover with the help of God.
The form of the cautery which is used for the belly is the claw: according as its shape is; and the form which is used for the back is the olive, according as its shape is.
Note: The provided text does not include any information regarding the method of cauterizing feet or limbs, so I am unable to translate that portion of the sentence.
When the limbs are apostematized in Hydropsism, and the cavity is filled with lemon juice: it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the nook, which is between the heel and the toe: and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then raise your hand again: and do not move it at all
The lemon juice will rise up again, and the cautery should be in the same form.
Then make over two crura two cauteries in every limb, and make the cautery with the extremity of the knife of the cautery: and make the cautery according to the length of the limb, one under the knee and the other below the knee, about the middle of the limb: and over every hip make two cauteries. And draw out the cautery without treatment for a long time: until something from it comes away with some water. Then care for the rest as we have said.
Then make over two crura two cauteries in every limb, and make the cautery with the tip of the knife of the cautery: and make the cautery according to the length of the limb, one under the knee and the other below the knee, about the middle of the limb: and over every hip make two cauteries. And draw out the cautery without treatment for a long time: until something comes away from it with some water. Then care for the rest as we have said.

And draw out the cautery without treatment for a long time: until something comes away from it with some water. Then care for the rest as we have said.
When the belly is in a state of solution from cold and moisture, until the power of retention and digestion is weakened in the stomach and intestines: and this is cured with the methods of treatment, and not by nature. And the broth tolerates the excessive power of the cautery: then make the cautery with a large knife over the belly, as it was before with the circular cautery, and four cauteries around the navel, below the ribs, and a cautery under the rib, and a cautery over the fatty tissue above the hips, or two cauteries.
And if the broth moistens the excess, and the patient tolerates this, then make the cautery with a knife over the loin, and a cautery over every hip: and perhaps add two small cauteries near the large one.

When there are many old hemorrhoids in the rectum, either one or several, and they are from gross, cold, or moist humors, they are cured when treated as we have said above; and no other treatment is required: then cauterize three times with the cautery over the lower part of the spine under the almonds and triangular, and cauterize under the navel as with two fingers.
And if you think that his stomach is stiff and his food does not digest, and his face is pale and his feces are watery, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery, as we have said before: and cauterize over the liver and over the spleen and over the tail, with a closed cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: then care for him until he is healed.
There exists a most effective treatment whose application does not err. When the uterus has been cut, and there are many small blood vessels which are liable to bleed, cauterize over them with a small cautery, without causing damage to the vessel
When you cut the uterus, then you should apply the cautery which contracts the vessel. Then introduce the burning part of the cautery into the cut uterus: and move your last hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vagina, from which blood flows: do this once or twice.
If there are many blood vessels in the uterus, then cauterize each one as we have said before Then care for it until it is cured, when that which is given from unguents has been administered.
And if you cauterize it with great heat over the wound, that is the last resort in treatment.</start_of_turn>
As to the cautering of a fistula in the rectum.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXXVIII.</start_of_turn>
When the patient does not obey the section and the work that we have mentioned in its place, and returns from it, perhaps he will be cured by cautery.</start_of_turn
When this happens to any fistula, and it becomes old, pus comes from it, and the tissues are softened.</start_of_turn Therefore it is necessary to explore it with a subtle hook.</start_of_turn Then learn the depth of it with the hook.</start_of_turn
Then apply the cautery, which is like a knife.</start_of_turn Then enter the burning itself into the fistula and the amount in which the clamp has entered.</start_of_turn
And repeat the cautery above until all the corrupted bodies are consumed, once, or twice, or three times, according to the necessity.</start_of_turn
And guard against overheating the nerve, if there is any, or the great veins: or if the fistula goes to the bladder or the intestines, then guard against those places as well.</start_of_turn
Do not do this except when the fistula is in a fleshy place: and remember that it is not penetrating.</start_of_turn
Then care for the place until it is cured.</start_of_turn>
If, however, the place is sealed and materials are detached from it, and it remains thus for a long time: then you know that it is completely healed.
If it is not detached from it by materials, then you know that it is penetrating, or that there is a broken bone beneath the surface, or almost like this: whose memory will come to the place.
In this way, concerning cauterization of the Renes.
When it happens in the Renes that there is pain from cold or from great swelling, and that it is diminishing because of that which is causing the infirmity, then it is necessary to cauterize it over the marrow above the kidneys, with cautery over every kidney along with the nail, the precursor of which is memory
And perhaps we must cauterize it also in the very marrow. For there will come three lines. Therefore there will be two last things in the treatment
In this way, concerning the cauterization of the Vesica
When there is weakness in the Vesica due to gravel and humidity until the infirmity does not retain urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the belly above the Vesica, where the hair of the flanks begins, and cauterize from the right side of the belly and from the left side of it: and let the length of the cauterization on the side be according to the quantity of the node of the thumb: and cauterize with a lower cautery or with two, if you wish. And let it be according to what precedes the cautery nail
In this way, concerning the cauterization of the Matrix
When in the Matrix cold and moisture abound, and it is forbidden by this [condition] from impregnation, and its menses are corrupted, and its production is delayed, and there is pain added to its companion, then it is necessary to cauterize three times around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and cauterize over the lower belly skin, or two cauteries: and let the cauteries be blunt.
In dislocation of the Ancham, cauterize three times around the navel, as we said above.</start_of_turn>
When moisture of the mucous membrane flows down to the heel of the Ancham, and is the cause of its displacement from its place: the sign of this is that one thigh is prolonged over the other, when compared with the thigh on the same side: and the place of dislocation is found in that groove.</start_of_turn
It is therefore necessary to cauterize the diseased part above the heel of the Ancham with a circle: after you have marked the sign with the cautery around the circumference of the heel, as if you were rolling: and that the heel itself falls in the middle of the circle.</start_of_turn
If this cautery is not present, then cauterize it three times with a large olive cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin altogether.</start_of_turn
Then take care of it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
(The text continues with instructions for treating sciatica.)</start_of_turn>
When pain arises in the ankle bone, and the cause is coldness and moisture: the physician should treat the patient with what has been mentioned previously [in another section], and if no benefit results, he should dry it up: then it is necessary to remove the patient from the thick humours with foul pills or artificial pills, and like these. Then cauterize it.
And the mode of cautery in this case is in two ways: either with cautery and astringents, or with fire.
Cautery with fire is done in many ways.
One of them is to cauterize over the ankle bone itself with three triangular cautery instruments, according to this form. And make the burn either deep or shallow And let the space between every two cauteries be of the quantity of the breadth of a finger: and let the cautery be round
When, however, the cautery is done in the middle over the ankle bone itself. Then there are four cautery instruments
And if you wish to cauterize in a circular fashion, whose form precedes the cautery of dislocation of the ankle, one: so that it may contain the whole ankle
And burn the whole thickness of the skin.
This is the mode of cautery in Sciatica, when the pain is adherent to the ankle itself, and does not extend up to the knee and thigh
If, however, it extends up to the knee and thigh, then cauterize the two cautery instruments over the knee, over the place where the patient feels pain there, and cauterize your hand over the heel of the foot to the outer side: and let the cautery be with a knife
The depth of the burn should be in accordance with the depth of the hair of the skin.
If the patient complains that the pain extends up to the toes, then burn only in that place as much as the burn of a point, a third, or a fourth, or even more, as is necessary for that area.</start_of_turn>
If it is said that the pain is under the knee and above the ankle, then burn only in that place with a single knife.</start_of_turn>
And burn always in your cauterizations, that you do not reach the nerves or great vessels, and that you do not cause excessive pain or contraction.</start_of_turn>
I also know of one who cauterized over the knee and left the last burn until the leg was swollen, until the foot was completely swollen and perforated, and the whole leg was corrupted: then the belly burst open and there was death after that.</start_of_turn>
If the pain is in two parts together, burn both of them in this manner.</start_of_turn
And some wise men say concerning the cauterization of an abscess, that this is the manner.</start_of_turn Make a resemblance like iron, whose diameter is a middle of the palm: and let it be at a distance from its orifice equal to the length of the kernel of the thumb, or less: and there let there be the third part within.</start_of_turn
And let there be space between every part of the three that is equal to the quantity of the wrist-knot: and let the burn be open from two parts: and let its height be like a knot, or two knots: and make the handle of the iron centered in the burns.</start_of_turn
Then it is ignited in the fire until it turns red, and it throws sparks: then it is placed upon a cushion of felt covering the painful side over the healthy side. It is cauterized with three round cauteries in one vessel
Then let it be withdrawn three days later. Afterward it is plastered with butter: and let the wound be opened for many days. Then care for it with unguents until it heals.
Albucasis says, concerning this kind of cautery, of the son of the blacksmith, we use it little, because of its fearsome appearance: and because of this, we find few who are willing to endure it over it
Indeed, from the good cauteries it is useful to him who suffers, and it is found with him in its place.
The cautery, however, with the physicians who are accustomed to it, is useful as when you make two holes in the arm of a man who has a wound of the artery of the wrist: from which the bone of the hand comes down, either of iron or of lead, the length of the wall: of which two knots should be made at the height of these.
And there should be a space between each quantity equal to the thickness of a finger, and there should be an opening below and above: and it should contain itself inside, according to this form
Then put it upon a cushion of felt covering the painful side over the healthy side And press your hand over the cushion of felt many times Then pour between two circles of hot water, which is warmed with fire a little, and keep it for the quantity of an hour: and the patient will tolerate the biting of the cautery, and he himself brings it to himself, for he finds the biting to be like fire until it rests.
Then raise your hand with the instrument and bathe the whole area with warm water and sweet water: then leave it for three days.
And put butter on it, until the black of the wound has subsided: and leave it for a few days, and pus will flow out of it. This is the last thing to do.
Then care for it with unguents, until it heals
If the pain extends to the hip or the knee: make for it a bath containing as much water as you did in the whole area
This is the way of warm water: and I have written it in the treatise on medical rectifications. Take alkali and unburnt lime, mix both in an equal amount: put each of them in a new vessel, whose lower part is pierced with a small hole according to the quantity which is to be included: and put under the bottom of the vessel another vessel filled with vinegar: and pour over the alkali and lime solution sweet water, which submerges both by a finger: and then press your hand firmly: and leave the vessel until the acute water has descended from the lower part of the treated vessel.
Then gather up the whole water, and pour it over the lime: and leave it, until it recovers
These are themselves strong and acute, which are administered in many medical operations and in the cauterization of the rest of the limbs. For it makes the operation of fire itself
And from the physicians, who cauterize the area, even as for testicles, and mas, and almond oil, and lime with soap, thus that both are mixed together.
Galen also reports that a certain man from ancient times received treatment for pain in the buttocks and sciatica: and he praised his diligence. He said that no other treatment was required, and that he was healed by one bath alone.
It is as it is said of the physician: if the patient does not improve with oil, let him be bathed with hot water; and let him be massaged frequently with much fat, and let him be placed upon the buttocks, where the pain is, or the thigh, or the hip: and it shall be bound, and it shall be left for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels relief from the pain. Then let him be put into the bath.
When his body is softened, put him into the tub. For the pain will depart, and he will be healed
And you know that no other cauterization should be used with these medicines, except after the evacuation of the body.
Dioscorides also says that the dung of goats, when cauterized with it, gives relief to the sciatica: and it is cauterized in this way.</start_of_turn> Let a lancet be taken, and let it be soaked in old oil, and let it be placed upon the deep place which is between the thumb of the foot and the heel, and is closer to the heel.</start_of_turn>
Then take the dry dung of goats, and burn it in the fire, until it is black.</start_of_turn
Then put it upon the lancet, and leave it until it is extinguished.</start_of_turn Then do it again. Then do it again until sensation returns above the mediation, and the pain has ceased.
This is the method of cautery known as the Vaccinum cauterium.</start_of_turn>
Of the cautery of back pain.</start_of_turn>
When there is pain in the back from numerous causes, or from a wound, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, or in similar cases, neither cautery nor any other remedy will suffice, except for one kind which is made from the infusion of cold and moist matter.</start_of_turn
It is necessary, therefore, after evacuation of the patient with foul pills and similar substances, to make three lines on the back where the pain is, alongside the palm of the hand, and when signs of scorching appear in every line after having made five cauteries, or more according to the patient's tolerance.</start_of_turn
And if desired, cauterize three or four times with the middle cautery, according to this form.</start_of_turn
Of the method of cautery in the groin.</start_of_turn
This pain often occurs in young children.</start_of_turn
The sign of its inception in children is: when there is a tightening in the belly at inspiration near elevation, and movement: and it is found in the last vertebra of the back and the nodes of the back, which begin to stand out over the rest.</start_of_turn
When you have done that, and you wish to make that, then burn it with the cautery which is circular in shape according to this form.
The cautery shall grasp every part of the bone equally: and if you wish to burn around the bone with the cautery, make two or three points, and let the points be close to one another
Then take care of the place, until it is healed as we have said.
And burn, lest you administer the cautery to a callous person, which is in the spasm of a nerve.
In the same way as for cautery of the foot and the joining pains.
When the pains of the joints are from cold humors which flow upon every limb of the body, then when such pains happen in the feet, it is customary among physicians to call it Podagra
When therefore Podagra is cured by the coldness of causes, with methods of treatment, and the pains are not removed, then the cautery will remove them.
And it is necessary to burn around the joint of the foot after the evacuation with many cauteries: and let the cautery be of Olivewood
And if you do not wish to make holes on the face of the foot, then make it with the point of the cautery. And if the pains ascend up to the knee, or remain in the other joints, and many such things happen, then burn the whole knee with three, or four cauteries, with the same cautery of Claudius.
If necessary are more of these for the cautery, then cauterize it. Do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but rather keep the thickness of the skin at a distance from it.
If, however, pain rises to the knees and back: then manage what we said concerning the cautery in its chapter
If the pain is only in the hands: then prick in the circumference of the fingers, as two lines are unrolled
If, however, the pain remains in the digits: then prick throughout the node of the digit, over every point of the digit, and over the palm of the hand.
If, however, the pain ascends after a day to the elbows or shoulders: then cauterize both of them from all sides
And do not aggravate the sick person by harsh methods, but by the advice of doctors. For if a good regimen is made, and the phlegm is evacuated, the healing will be aided by God with this cautery
On the method of cautery in ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine or bladder descends to the testicle, and this is at the beginning close: then it is necessary for the patient to vomit immediately on that day. And to evacuate from soft things, so that the stool may descend from its belly
Then sit between your hands on your back: and command him to hold his breath until he vomits, or until the bladder or intestine appears
Then reduce the finger with your thumb, and sign with the sign of the encaustro below the rupture above the bone of the knee, with the sign whose extremity is similar to the middle of the circle towards the upper parts of the body.
Then apply the cautery, which has this shape, until it turns white, and then remove the cautery. Then reduce the intestine or the bladder to their own cavity Then place your hand on the place, so that the intestine does not escape: and you have opened between the ribs of the patient, and placed under it powder, and another servant on his ribs and another on his chest which holds the hand.
Then place the cautery on that sign, your hand with the cautery standing straight up And hold it there, until you follow the bone: or do it again with it another way, if you have not followed it with it from the beginning until the bone
And observe prudently the exit of the intestine in the hour of your cautery, so that you do not burn it, and that it comes out through that over the patient or the wound, or great malice.
And know that when you do not follow with the cautery the bone, your operation will be in vain
And it is necessary that the cautery be fine for infants, according to their measure
Then care for the rest of the wounds, until they are healed.
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound has healed
And it is necessary that you give the patient nourishment throughout the time of his cure, so that it softens his belly: so that the intestine does not escape through the wound and be evacuated
Then when he wishes to rise after forty days, he must manage the ligament which is made central and keep it for forty days more.
He will abstain from labor, and take nourishment of food and drink, and use of strong medicines.
For when he follows this regimen, he will be restored to complete health.
And I will speak of the treatment of ruptures with incision in his chapter.
When however ruptures happen in the remaining part within, and are just beginning, and you wish that they should not grow larger, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its quantity: and let it be so that from that time forward it will endure as much as a third of it Then care for it as we have said: and do not add to it
And some say that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form
When it is signed with encasement, and a line is drawn through the width at the upper side of the rupture, and a line to the lower side. And place your hand in the middle with the cautery handle.
But the first cautery is easier and better.
In like manner the cautery is to be used for pains caused by swelling or percussion
Chapter XLVIII
When anything has happened to any limb by swelling or percussion and the pain persists for a long time, and does not yield to treatment with physicians: then it is necessary to cauterize with the Puncti cautery
And let the cautery be of the size of the limb, and its degree, and its hardness, and its toughness, and the place of torsion, and the pain from it
If the patient has recovered from the first cautery, it is good. If not: then repeat the cautery above the first one.</start_of_turn>
For the custom of these pains is that they change from member to member approaching the one that is most proximate to them.</start_of_turn> Therefore one must follow these with the cautery until the patient is healed.</start_of_turn
Concerning the cautery of Lepra.</start_of_turn
Leprosy sometimes requires the greatest cautery.</start_of_turn And especially those kinds of leprosy which are caused by the corruption of phlegmas and melancholia: in such cases one must carefully consider the very act of cautery.</start_of_turn
If the leprosy is not severe, and the swelling has gone down as we have mentioned previously, and has not reappeared: and the time has come for the patient, who has suffered corruption throughout his body: then burn him five times with the cautery: one in the middle of the head, one below at the front near the hair's end, and two on the two horns, and one at the back on the nape of the neck.</start_of_turn
And finally, touch his hand with the cautery lightly, until you make an imprint in the bone, and the cortex is fractured: so that the great vapors will be driven out from it, and burn the spleen also with the cautery, as we have said before.</start_of_turn
If however the leprosy has spread throughout the body and is obvious: then burn with these cauteries which we have mentioned in the head, and cauterize the tip of the nose, and two on the two cheeks, and two on the two cheekbones, and six on the vertebrae of the neck, and one large one on the flanks of the buttocks and one above the kidneys: and two on the buttocks: that is one on each buttock, and two on the knees: one on each knee, and two on the biceps, and two on the triceps, and two on the chest, and cauterize the whole of the joints between the fingers and toes, and the heels of the feet.
And take care that from the nerves which are above the heel, so that you do not burn them.
When the cautery is applied above the heel, and also above the ribs, and also above the spleen.
And know that the more you add of the cautery, the more damage is done, and the more likely it is to cause harm
And know that the sickly man does not feel pain from the cautery, just as the healthy do: because the body of the sickly man is already stunned
It is necessary that the cautery should be of appropriate size, and in proportion to the members and the joints: according to what preceded from the kinds of instruments.
Then take care of the cautery with an herb paste with honey, and the rest of the treatment, until the wound is healed
As to the cautery of the heel...
When some limb is stiff and cannot be cured by physicians, and oils, and poultices, and it does not heal, then cauterize the stiff limb with cautery, according to the size of the limb or its proportion
And let the cautery not penetrate too deeply into the skin. Then take care of it with an unguent, until it is healed
When the cautery is applied to some stiffness of the hand or foot, in the joints of the back near the exit of the nerves which move that limb: then the stiffness will be removed
But do not be rash over this, except for one who is learned in the anatomy of the limbs and the course of the nerves
How to cauterize in Albaras.
When Albaras has hardened, and no remedy from medical knowledge can be found: then cauterize over the cauterium itself deeply but sparingly, according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin, until the white is removed, and the color changes.
Then care for it with barley flour and lentils with oil of rose, and arnica leaves, and poppyseed, and hyacinth blood: take a part of each: mix them together, and spread over the wound, and adhere to the place, until it heals
How to cauterize in Cancer
When Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with the cauterium in a circle around its circumference, as it returns
But the wise men say, that one should cauterize in the middle last of all.
I do not see that: for I fear that it will ulcerate: and I do see it often.
And it is better to cauterize around it with a circle, as we said: or with many cauteriums.
How to cauterize in Adubelati
When anyone has Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturity, or because of excess fat making it fat, or because of age which makes it frail, or because of weakness, or because of time, and he wishes to hasten the maturity of the Adubelati: then cauterize around it with many small cauteriums puncturing Then depart from it. Then depart from it. For itself will hasten with maturity.
If, however, you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then ignite the cautery, whose form is this.
And place it in the middle of the Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be away from that which follows the diseased, in order to diminish the course of the pus.
Then care for it until it is healed
In a corroding wound, cauterize cautiously
Day 42.
A wound is not corrosive except for corruption in a mobile limb, and it corrupts it: like fire consumes dry wood
If therefore you wish to cauterize the corrosive in a place where it tolerates it with fire, then ignite the cautery frequently, make the blisters small and large, according as it will be convenient in the place where it is corrosive
Then cauterize it from all sides until you have eradicated the whole corruption, and let nothing remain of it except for the very little
Then leave it for three days, and put upon the cauterized place powdered sulphur with oil, until all the scabs are eradicated and the whole corruption is gone
Then care for it with nourishing poultices of flesh.
If therefore you see that after three days new flesh is born healthy, in which there is no corruption, it is good
And if not: then repeat the cautery over that which remains of the corrupted places
A wound is treated with acute medicine when necessary It itself arises from the place of the cautery.
Indeed, it arises from the place of the cautery.
For indeed, the cautery is of quicker healing when applied to ulcers and boils.
It is of quicker healing when applied to ulcers and boils
Many times this ailment occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a great, swelling, painful thing that affects the foot.
And the cautery is of two kinds: with fire and with hot water
When the cautery is done with fire, it is like branding a goose feather: this is done with iron according to the amount that it contains in the limb from every side: and it must not touch the edges
Then put the fire on the limb. Then withdraw the limb with the cautery around the limb until the cautery reaches the depth of the limb: and leave it for three days until it begins to discharge pus Then cover it with coarse sand, sprinkle with salt: and leave the dressing on it overnight And it will itself disappear from its root
Then take care of the place where the flesh has been burnt, until it has healed
If they are not cauterized, and appear many times on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then administer the cautery with hot water: and take a piece of iron, or a piece of wood, or a feather from a bird: and put it on the limb, or on the ulcer. Then pour a small quantity of hot water into the cannula: hold your hand steady and withdraw the cannula with pressure on your hand near the root of the claw, so that the mark of the cannula may be impressed on the root of the claw. Then find the hot water up to the root of the claw: and the patient should expect relief after an hour of the hot water treatment.
Then withdraw it, for the claw is eradicated with its roots.</start_of_turn>
Do so with one hand after the other, until you reach above all that is in the body.</start_of_turn>
Then care for the wound after it has been eradicated, with what is generated from the split flesh.</start_of_turn>
In Tremore, cauterize in this way.</start_of_turn
When it happens to anyone to have a tremor from cold in the nerve, or from a quartan fever, or something else: then it is necessary to cauterize four times, or five on the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra cauterize, and in the chest cauterize, and on the stomach cauterize.</start_of_turn
The tremor will cease with the cauterization of olive oil, and health will quickly return from the cold sickness.</start_of_turn
Thus cauterize Albathir.</start_of_turn
Chapter 67.</start_of_turn
When there are expelled from the body of Albathir wounds, that is, abscesses, which are formed from corrupted thick matter.</start_of_turn
It is necessary therefore in the first place when they appear to cauterize over every head of the abscess with a fine cautery with a twig of myrrh whose extremity is kindled with fire.</start_of_turn As with the root of aristolochia longae. Or as with the cautery of a lentil
And sometimes when cauterizing the blood clots, at the beginning of their expulsion, they do so in this way: and do not grow: and rupture the superfluity that makes them, and heal from within.
However, it must be done after evacuation with a bloodletting.
As to the cautery in the flow of blood from an artery to the wound
Many things happen with the flow of blood from an artery that has been incised at the wound, which happens both outside and at the incision of the apostem, or by the cautery of a limb, and the like: and this makes it difficult to stop the bleeding
When this happens to anyone, then act promptly with your hand at the orifice of the artery, and place above it your finger index: and tighten it much, until the blood is stopped under your finger, and does not escape from there again
Then put in the fire a small olive cautery, and many in number: and blow over them, until they are ignited thoroughly
Then grasp from the thing one, or a little, or a lot, according to the wound and the place where the artery is ruptured, and place the cautery upon that very place: and when you have moved your finger away quickly: and hold the cautery, until the bleeding is stopped
And if it is expelled when you remove your finger from the orifice of the artery, and extinguish the cautery, then grasp another cautery quickly from those which are prepared in the fire.
Do not cease to perform it until the blood is severed.
Do not burn the nerve that is there, and add over the sick some other malice.
Know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to sever it: especially when the artery is great, except with four fingers. Or with a cautery, as we have said before. Or by extraction, when it is not extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities are contracted, and the blood is severed. Or it is bound with a strong ligature Or there are placed over it medicines of the property of severing blood, and it is bound with a nail of constriction of descent
Whoever performs the severance with a ligature, and tightens with a bandage or position of the burning things, or the like, does not give it sufficient pain, except rarely
If however it is done to someone, and there is no physician present, neither medicine: then begin with the position of the index finger over the orifice of the vein itself, as we have said, and its constriction above, until the blood is overcome from the upper part of the wound, and over the artery And the finger is not moved, except with cold water or ice always, until the blood is congealed, and has become firm, and is severed.
And meanwhile consider what is needed from the cautery, or from the medicine.
On Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in Wounds, and Similar Procedures.
We have already said in the first chapter that all diseases in which fire and burning medicine concur, and their occasions, their causes, and their instruments, and the forms of cautery
And I shall treat of the chapters following from the head to the foot.
I shall pursue this chapter in the same way: as one who seeks an answer to his inquiry
Before I begin, it is necessary to tell you what is omitted from this chapter in comparison with the first chapter on cautery
Therefore it is necessary to exercise caution in this operation, because in this chapter there falls out evacuation with blood in many places: in the opening of the vein, or the incision over the bone, or the opening of an abscess, or the care of a wound, or the extraction of an arrow, or the incision over a stone, and such like things. From all of these things there is associated tremor, and fear, and falls in many of them blood
I warn you, do not be afraid of this, for in this art there are many people who have become skilled as men in health have become skilled in sickness. For from this is he who flees from his ailment, and is light in the face of danger: because of his gentleness which he has from his ailment and the length of his experience And when an ailment comes from fear, it signifies death.
From him also is the one who gives you his staff, and tells you that he is with you, hoping for your health, and his ailment is mischievous.
It is not proper that you consent to those who come to you from outside, whose manner is such. You should be cautious with them, more so than with love and your own possessions. Do not presume anything about them, except after certain knowledge has been revealed to you, which confirms that their actions are worthy of praise
Use your care in treating all female patients, in prognostication and indication of the thing which is conducive to their health
For in this lies your help in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise
May God inspire you, his son, your intellect, and do not take from you direction and inspiration: for this is in his hand
And I, too, have ordained this chapter distinguishing it by chapters, according as it follows the chapter of Cauteries, from the navel until the feet: that you may fulfill your desire and what you need from this.
Concerning the treatment of water which accumulates in the heads of children.
Chapter I.
You know that this ailment often happens to children at birth: or when the midwife tightens the head of the child without gentleness
And sometimes it also happens for an occult cause which is not known
I have not seen this illness in anyone except children: and for all those whom I have seen among them, death has been the consequence: for this reason it is fitting for me to send away the operation in this case
And I have also seen among children whose heads were filled with water, and their heads would swell up every day, until they were unable to sit on their own because of the size of their heads: and the moisture increased until they died
And thus also is moisture, either collected between skin and bone: or collected under bone upon the fat.
And in that case, if there is moisture between skin and bone, and the swelling is slight, one must make a single incision in the middle of the head, about the length of two knots, until the moisture is drained.</start_of_turn>
This is the shape of a sponge.
If there is much moisture and the swelling is great, then one must make two incisions according to this form.</start_of_turn>
If the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that the edges of the head are open from every side: and water is driven out when you press your hand into the interior, and it is not hidden from you: then one must make three incisions in the middle of the head according to this manner.</start_of_turn
And after the incision drain out all the moisture.</start_of_turn> Then stitch up the incisions with silk and wool.</start_of_turn Then bandage it above with wine and oil until the fifth day.</start_of_turn>
Then loosen the ligament and care for the wound with tension and care.</start_of_turn
And do not tighten the head too tightly.</start_of_turn And give the patient little food and much dry food until the limb is comfortable and healed.</start_of_turn
And another method of incision is to consider the size of the swelling and the collection of water.</start_of_turn
For sometimes in the skull there is more, or in the eyebrow, or on the right, or on the left.</start_of_turn
Rise therefore when the incision is made where the swelling appears and the water is poured in: and cut that according to what is possible.
Observe, lest you cut an artery, and the blood flow increase, and the patient die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
Concerning the incision of the arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter II
When any swelling comes about in the eyes or the chest, and the disease persists, and no remedy is of avail: then the last remedy is the incision of these two arteries
It is necessary therefore when you wish to make an incision, that you remove the patient's head. Then scrape the place with rough cloth, so that the arteries appear Then bind the patient's neck with anything he has of his own cloth Then consider where the pulse of the vein lies And the places where both are located are those which are behind the ears depressed: and they are rarely hidden, except in some men
Then mark with a burn on each side: and cut each one with a needle as sharp as possible, cutting through to the bone: and do this through the breadth of the head.
And if you wish, insert a sponge under the artery, and cut above with the incision.
And let the length of the incision be like two joined fingers
For when the artery is cut, blood flows out with the pulsation, which leaps inside with great jumps
If however the artery does not appear to the sense, then it is necessary to measure three digits from the ear. Then signs with incisions, and find until the bone.
And what should be emitted from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps more or less is emitted from it. All this according to the quantity which you see from the patient's wound and the filling of its artery.
Then consider for the wound. Then if anything remains at the bone from the scraping, then cut that away, so that there does not happen a stiff swelling: then bind the wound with strips of linen cloth.
Then care for it with ointment, until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of arteries, which are in the temperaments.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 3.</start_of_turn>
When it happens to a man an ancient headache, or acute catarrh because of acrid humilities and warmth in the lacerations of the temperaments, or ancient soda, which is harmful, and similar to these: and it is medicated with the methods of medical treatment, and does not depart from it: then we are experts in the extraction of arteries from the temperaments, or their cauterization, as we have narrated.</start_of_turn>
And the manner of the operation in the extraction of these is that the patient shaves the hair which is in the temperaments, and exposes the apparent artery in the temperament.</start_of_turn It itself is shown to you from its pulse, and rarely is it hidden except in a few people, or because of excessive cold.</start_of_turn
If it is hidden from you, then the patient should bind his head with anything he has: then rub the place with rough cloth.</start_of_turn Until the steam rises to the surface like hot water, the phenomenon shall be evident. Then grasp the sponge, which is before your eyes in its form.</start_of_turn> Then strip off the skin with it [the sponge] until you reach the artery.</start_of_turn Then throw the ligature into the loop and draw it upwards, until you have pulled the ligature out from the skin, and made it retract from the tunics beneath it on all sides.</start_of_turn>
If the artery is small: then loop the ligature around the extremity of the needle.</start_of_turn Then cut from it the part according to the length of its extremities, and tighten, and the blood flow will cease.</start_of_turn For if it is not cut through, or if it is not severed, the blood will not ascend fully.</start_of_turn
Then wash from the blood about six ounces, until three.</start_of_turn
If the artery is large: then it is necessary to ligate it in two places with a strong thread, of silk: or with horsehair, so that it does not become putrefied before the wound has consolidated, and the blood flow is restored.</start_of_turn
Then cut away the surplus, which is between the two ligatures.</start_of_turn Do this in an hour, or an hour later.</start_of_turn
And if necessary, cauterize the skin with a cautery until the extremities of the ligature have been cut through, and it has stabilized in the place of the work.</start_of_turn
It is better to do the work when the patient has a normal temperature, or slightly feverish, than when the patient is feverish.</start_of_turn Since the cautery is from the earth, which moves towards the completion of moistnesses. Therefore is the application better.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, that the cautery be applied to the old place: and that it be placed over the middle of the wound.
And after the closing it is to be cared for with dry medicines, which make the flesh grow, and with sponges, until it is healed.
Which if, during the work, blood flows from the artery, then it is proper to cut off the same with the cautery, or to place the cautery at the place of the blood vessel: and hold your hand, until the blood is stopped Which if nothing of these is present, then put over the place your finger, until the blood congeals And embroider the place with cold water, until the pain is quieted, and be bound according as it is necessary.
And from this it is evident that it is more easy and manageable to extract the artery, when this cautery has two blades: and that the sharpness of the two blades is similar to that of an almond Yet are these of much less sharpness than two blades. Since if they are sharp, like two blades, both are apt to cause frost: and they do not cut the flesh with speed. Since therefore in the earth there is somewhat of thickness, it is held in the earth the heat of fire, and the flesh is quickly cut off: with this therefore the work is better in all respects, and easier, and more manageable
This is the form of the burn.
And let the space which is between the two blades be as much as the thickness of a finger, after you have marked two points with the cautery: and place both of them alight, until they reach the bone, and cut the artery in two places: that it may be prolonged which is between the extremities of it. They do not solidify with this deep burn.
Chapter III
Be attentive to acute tear-lachrymal fluid from the eyes
When tears are viscous and flow from the eyes, which are above the outer part of the head: then it does not require any medical treatment from physicians, and the liquid makes the face of the patient red, and he feels a wandering in his face like the wandering of ants: and his eyes are swollen and wet, as though they were corroded by something: and his eyelids are reddened from the intensity of the tears. Then the old people say in the treatment of these things by means of an operation, and they call this treatment "Ense".
It is also necessary to remove the hairs in front of his face from the patient Then make three incisions at an equal distance from each other according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the incision be like two fingers, and let one incision be at an equal distance from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length of the lower lip, and the third from the other side: and cauterize from the arteries which are in the two sides. And extend your hand from the continuation of your two mandibles, and let the space of the incision be as much as the thickness of three fingers together. And let a sponge be prepared, or dry cloth, with which to soak up the blood.</start_of_turn>
Then insert the sponge of two acute extremities, whose following shape is like this.</start_of_turn> From the incision which is at the temple, up to the second incision: and scrape with it all the skin which is between the two incisions, with a sponge, which is over the bone.</start_of_turn Then do it also from the middle incision up to the second incision. Then extract the sponge and introduce another instrument, which is called the sharp scalpel, from one wide side, not from the acute side This is its form.
And place its acute side towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its wide side towards the bone: and push it in until it reaches the middle incision: and cut through everything that descends from the head to the eyes: except that which appears on the skin.
Then do it also from the middle incision up to the second incision
And when blood has flown out in an equal amount, express the place from coagulated blood clots
Then place in every incision a patch of coarse cotton, and put over that soaked wool pads in wine, and oil, or vinegar. And see that no swelling occurs.
And on the third day heal the ligament, and give an abundant infusion with warm water. Then care for it from the ointment of basil, and leave the rest of the wounds to heal: until they are healed
Chapter V.
Concerning the care of sharp tears and catarrh to the eyes from the inside of the head
When these occur to anyone with acute, itchy, sticky tears: and when their eyes are extended, parched, and the sight is impaired: and the eyelashes are ulcerated, and hair falls out from the eyelids, and there is acute pain in the depths of the head, which brings about sneezing: then take away from these causes all those matters, and the catarrh will not come from these unless from many tears.
The best treatment in these cases is this. The best is to shave the patient's face thoroughly. Then make a single incision in the middle of the face, or on the other side along the width, and commence from the left ear towards the right ear: and reach the incision up to the bone: and stretch your hand from the edges of the wounds which move with chewing until the bone is reached: and you will extract all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two lips of the wound with wool or strips of linen Then bind up above with threads: and soak the threads with wine and oil, so that they do not cause a cold abscess
When you have finished, and you see that the abscess is about to disappear: then it is necessary to rub the bone until new flesh begins to form on it.
Then care for yourself with a regimen of nourishment that promotes the growth of flesh: such as if you were to take from wheat flour two parts and from barley four parts: and prepare from these a paste, and administer it to the wounds
(The text ends here.)
Concerning the care of these things that fall in autumn.
Everything that falls in autumn is of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something like a stone, such as iron, or gold: or it is from a plant, such as lentil, and beans: or it is a fluid substance, such as water, and vinegar, and blood, or something similar to these things.
When such a stone or kind of stone is fallen in autumn which does not grow in autumn from the earth, it exposes the autumn to the sun: if you wash the stone, then distil from oil or vinegar something from the earth in autumn. Then manage the extraction of it, and make the patient sit upright with his head supported, and anoint the nostrils near the site of the incision, after you have placed around the circumference of the ear a piece of cloth or wool, and extended the ear upwards.
Many are the things that depart with this care.
If, however, they do not depart, then manage the extraction of it with sponges, that is, fine sponges: whose form is like this.
If they depart with the sponge, that is good
And if not, then manage the extraction of it with a blunt needle of small size.
If it does not depart by this, then make a hole in the air, and insert the extremity of the needle into the ear much, and anoint what is around the needle with fat, so that there be no air in it: then draw out with your hand with force.
Many are the things that depart with this which we have said. If it does not depart in this way: then take from chaff or from blood, that is, prepared gluten, with which one captures doves, a remedy: and place it in the extremity of the radius after you have encircled above the knee bent downwards: then insert it into the ear with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture
If it does not depart with all that we have said, then prepare for cutting, before the swelling becomes great, or spasm.
And the manner of the incision is like that of a phlebotomy in the forehead: and draw out from the blood according to the measure of its virtue. Then make the patient sit between your hands, and support his ear upwards, and find the opening of the ear close to its fat in a depressed place: and let the incision be in the shape of a crescent, until you reach the bone: then take out the instrument with that which you are able.
Then seal the wound from this hour with speed, and care for it, until it is healed.
If a foreign body has fallen into the wound from one grain which is growing and swelling, then administer its extraction.</start_of_turn>
If it does not obey your command to come out, then take hold of a soft sponge, fine and smooth, according to this shape.</start_of_turn
And administer with it the excision of that kind from the grains that have fallen into the wound, and do not make that which you think is moist from the vapor of the ear, until you have put on many plugs: then extract them with hooks, or with fine fingers, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction alleviates it.</start_of_turn>
But when water enters the wound, the patient must be ordered to sneeze forcefully at first: and immediately moisten the wound with a little bit of old cloth: and it is placed over the wound which is in the water.</start_of_turn If it comes out through this, that is good.</start_of_turn
And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, round, smooth, and warm them with fire slightly, and let the patient put one finger into his ear: and salt his foot one from this side, and strike with another stone against the stone which is in the wound.</start_of_turn Do not cease doing this with the stone and the stone, until all the water has come out.</start_of_turn
And when the water comes out like this, take from the fire, or from a single jug, and introduce one extremity into the wound: and kindle the other extremity with fire, until most of it is consumed.</start_of_turn Then repeat the procedure with another sponge, making it much more thorough, until all the water has drained out: and extract the sponge with a tube as directed previously in the stone.
In the extraction of an animal within the body, if it is small in size, like a flea or its kin, take care of it as I have said in the instructions.</start_of_turn>
But if the body is large, which appears to the sense: then manage the extraction of it with hands and instruments: and thus its matter will be easier for all who hold it in the hand.</start_of_turn
In the extraction of a worm that has generated in the gold, when you have cured it as we have said in the instructions on distillation, and in the treatise on the distillation of urine, and its cure does not suffice: then you must burn the gold in the sun.</start_of_turn> If anything appears there from the worms, then extract it with hands or with fine instruments.</start_of_turn
If nothing appears there, then take a tube whose shape is like this, narrow below and wide above: and insert the lower extremity into the gold according to the amount that the sick person tolerates: then suck with it.</start_of_turn> Make it much more thorough, until all the worms have drained out.</start_of_turn
If they do not obey you with regard to the draining out, then smear around the circumference of the tube with lead, as I have said in the stone.</start_of_turn
If they do not drain out with this, then perform distillations which the ancient experts are experienced in concerning the junction of worms: and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.</start_of_turn
And let your effusion be such as that which flows out of oil and medicines into the gold with this instrument whose shape is like this.</start_of_turn As for wounds made from silver or from air, below is a stricture in which there is a small hole, and above it is broad.
Thus as for wounds inflicted by silver or air, below is a stricture in which there is a small hole, and above it is broad. If you will, take a sponge, and moisten its extremity with a poultice of lint: then pour oil, or succum, or whatever you will of these medicines into the tube: and let it be well closed: then introduce the sponge with the poultice above, and compress it with your hand until oil is squeezed out into the ear, and the patient feels it inside: and that which is poured into the ear should be made warm with a little fire: and beware lest anything be distilled in it when cold: for medicine does not bear that.</start_of_turn>
(The provided text does not include any information regarding "The care of wounds inflicted by gold," so I am unable to translate this sentence.)
And concerning the care of wounds inflicted by gold.
Whenever some children come out of their mothers' wombs unperforated.
And sometimes it happens also that some people have their ears opened up by a wound, or by meat being born in it
And this opening up happens sometimes in the depth of the ear-hole, which does not follow the usual course: and sometimes it happens outside the small hole of the ear, and follows the usual course.</start_of_turn>
That which happens in the depth of the ear and which is not comprehended by the aspect, is in many dispositions difficult to heal.</start_of_turn>
And as for that which follows the usual course, it is necessary to place the ear of the patient in the sun, and to press on it: then if the wound appears, open the hole with a fine lancet whose form is like this which follows, and let its extremity be in the part which has a small width, and whose part is acute: and the rest of the lancet should be soft on both sides: so as not to harm the ear.</start_of_turn
If, therefore, the swelling has arisen from the meat of the ear: then hold one finger under the skin, and pierce with ease until the whole flesh has been removed.
If the swelling is deep in the ear: then take a fine needle, thread it, and burnish with fire: then remove it from the meat of the ear.
If you feel swelling with pain, which the sick person has with a weighty ear, try to open it with ease: and be careful, lest you damage the nerves of the ear.
Then put in the ear a quantity of unguent according to the extent of the opening which you made in the Egyptian bandage: do this for a few days, until you are certain that the wound has healed
Or take a salve and mix it with rose-water, and sprinkle over it fine powder of burnt ochre, and use it thus.
If you wish to remove the swelling from the ear: then it is necessary to extract the salve and leave it with another salve which you mix with rose-water, which you put in a vessel made of beeswax: let the swelling become cold: then care for it until it is healed
If blood flows: then immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water and put it on the ear: and use the rest of the treatment which expels the blood which is said in the treatise on distillation.
(The text continues with instructions on how to treat eye ailments.)
(The heading of the next section is not included in the provided text.)
These are the Althelis which happen in the eyes when they are humid and are dry.
It is necessary therefore to hold them with nails: or with a finger, and pierce them with a needle from their roots. Then place above the wound a piece of sponge.
If blood flows from the wound, then cauterize it with a fine lancet.
It is better to cauterize after the incision has been made. Many things return when something remains of their root When they are cauterized with fire, those roots burn and do not return
Take care of the great palpebrae of the eye.
Chapter IX.</start_of_turn>
Many things happen in the palpebrae of the eye that assimilate Crandinum in its substance, and its hardness, and because of this it is called Great: and it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower palpebrae.
The operation is like this: if there is a Greatness proceeding from the palpebrae, which appears from the palpebra and moves to all parts, then it is easy to remove it
Find it above the opening by its width Then scrape it out from all around with ease until it is removed Then suspend it with a thread and cut it off.</start_of_turn>
If it is not prepared to be cut, except when you pierce the palpebra with a small incision, then it will be harmful to the patient in some way.</start_of_turn>
If the incision is large: then join it together with a suture: and take care of it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if it is small, it will not cause any harm from it.</start_of_turn The ointment restores itself and becomes flesh.
If it is large and extends deep into the ear, turn the ear inwards and suspend the greater part with a hook: for it is not necessary to make an incision, and press upon it from all sides.
And if the palpebra is prolonged by an incision, it does no harm in any way.
Then wash the eye after the incision with salt water: and care for the place with it which has become flesh, until the patient is healed.
On the care of the eyelids.
Chapter 10.
The eyelids are greasy substances which are generated in the upper eyelid tissues: and most of them happen to children. And they weigh down the eyes of them, and cause tears to fall from them in the mornings, and they cannot see the sunlight because of this, because the tears run down their faces, and because of this the eyelids are always wet under the eyebrows, which are swollen from the inflation: and the prominence of the Axirnath is seen in the eye, and when you press on it with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between your fingers.
And the way to treat it is to put the patient's head in your lap
Then take a piece of linen, and prepare in it a hook, and make from that hook a circle according to the quantity which contains the Axirnath from all sides And put it on the eye, and press with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath is collected in the middle of the circle
Then find in the middle of it humidity with slippery ointment applied to the split, and do not make a split greater than that which is made in phlebotomy at depth.
Either the entire skin must be stripped off, until it reaches Axirnath, or from the fissures the latter proceeds from, following the shape of the white fat.
Either the entire skin must be stripped off, until it reaches Axirnath, or from the fissures the latter proceeds from, following the shape of the white fat.
If, however, Axirnath does not appear at the beginning of the fissure, you must add slightly in the fissure until Axirnath proceeds. Then extract the fat as we have said before.
Then immerse the fat in vinegar and water, and place it on the place, and bind it with threads.
And from men there are some who anoint salt, and put it into the cavity of the fissure, so that it liquefies what remains of that moisture
Then care for it until it heals
If, however, blood appears in the place of the clot, then care for it with cold compresses until it heals
Regarding the treatment of the eye, that is, when the eyelids are softened, from which it results that the eye becomes red as it should not.
Chapter 11.
When in the eyelids of the eye hairs are added beyond their course under the natural hair, and are increased: then they harm the eye, and cause diseases such as excessive tears, and softening of the eyelids, and mucus, until it becomes the cause of the destruction of the eye.
And Ataxmir of the eye is treated in four ways. Or by cautery with fire. Or with sharp instruments, as is prescribed in the chapter on cautery. Or Ataxmir is treated by incision and stitching.</start_of_turn> Or by needles, as I shall say.</start_of_turn
You must place the head of the patient in your lap.</start_of_turn> Then grasp the lower eyelid with your left hand.</start_of_turn
If it is grasped, that is good.</start_of_turn And if not: introduce the needle through the skin at the place where the lash hair originates, and pass the needle together with the thread, and bring the thread up through the skin near the hair roots, where the hair arises: and draw the thread upwards towards the eyebrow, and tie it securely.</start_of_turn
Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hair the fat that hangs down from the larger lacrimal gland to the smaller lacrimal gland.</start_of_turn
Then draw out the thread, and put under the eyelid a small piece of cotton wool or gauze: then mark over the eye with ink, so that it looks like the figure of a myrtle leaf.</start_of_turn
It is true that the figure must be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for this varies in different people.</start_of_turn
And from this it is evident that the amount of excision which should be made from the eyelid is great, according to the amount that is softened by the eye.</start_of_turn
Then when the fat is found above two lines which you have marked, and you have reached from the larger lacrimal gland to the smaller lacrimal gland, make a single incision near the natural hair, as thick as the radius.</start_of_turn
Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin. Then strip off the entire skin. Then join together the two lips with a suture, with needle and fine thread: and drain the blood, and make fast what is superfluous from the threads above the two superciliums, with some useful material, if you wish to do so: or if not, do not care
Then remove the suture and thread for three days, or four: then care for it
And if you wish, remove the wound without suture, and care for it with oil, which will dry and harden it For the eyelids swell up at the sealing of the wound and its collection: but the future is better.
Such a way of treating was taught by the ancient Ataxmirans
It is true that there is concern over the infirm person, but this comes from a good operation, and not from fear
And another method in Ataxmir is as follows: and it is that the sign on the eyelid should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have described.
Then lift the eyelid with three separate hooks, or joined together, according to the shape of this sign, then cut away what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this shape, with the equality of the incision.
If, however, it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it is not equal: then grasp the point where the thread is, and insert it in the middle of the sign: and insert another thread near the greater lacrimal gland, and another thread near the smaller lacrimal gland: and join together the two threads with the equal length of the suture
Then elevate your hand equally high: and elevate the skin above that which is marked on the limb, as we have said.
Then close the two lips of the wound with suture: and care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
If indeed swelling occurs at the incision of your wound, or a tear of the wound: retain that swelling with earth, and with like things, from unguents sitting.</start_of_turn
And whenever the eyelids also swell, so that their hair is twisted: convert their hair.</start_of_turn
It is necessary therefore that you use what we have said concerning the incision: but the suture of both is an artificial thing.</start_of_turn As for care of Ataxmir with dogs.</start_of_turn
And it is, that you cover the eye, and split the tear which is inside, according as I have said.</start_of_turn Then make two incisions, or two small sticks under the lash: whose length is according to the length of the eye, and the width of them less than the width of the pupil: and I shall insert the thread at the extremities of both from both parts where you hold the thread.</start_of_turn
Then close both with a suture over that which is superfluous from the eye, and bind the two threads from both parts strongly, and let go of it every few days.</start_of_turn The skin will therefore become strict, and will die, and will become black, until it falls away of itself.</start_of_turn
If indeed it is delayed, then cut through it with scissors.</start_of_turn Then care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
When the bone is firmly set, elevate the eyelids: and do not puncture the hair.
This is the shape of two nails, which you make according to this figure and their quantity in length and breadth.
Chapter XII
About the elevation of the hair piercing in the eye with the needle
The operation in this is that you take a fine needle and introduce it through a fine silk thread, soft Then gather its extremities and knot both knots with a fine knot: and let the length of the thread be one palm
Then make a second fine knot under this in a short space, and knot its extremities if you wish.
Then put the patient's head in your lap, and let it rest close to the cheek so that the operation is evident: because the operation is slight, or even almost insignificant.
Then introduce the needle with the thread under the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you have pulled out the natural hair
Then draw out the hair up to the thread: and introduce into the thread the light of one, or two, or three hairs, not more
Then draw your hand away with it, until the hair comes out with the thread in the eyelid with the natural hair
If, however, you pull out the thread, and the hair does not come out with it: pull out the thread to the lower part, with the thread which you made in it, until the thread comes out from the upper hole, and you see the eye: then indeed pull out the thread and the needle: and close the eye: and keep it closed for two days, or three, until the hair has adhered to its place and has grown over the wound
If the hair is short, then either associate with it a long hair from natural hair, and elevate it with it; or let it go, until it has elongated over space, and then elevate it.
Of the care of the upper eyelid.
When this occurs with the eye, it is called the Leporina.
This care is either natural or accidental
Accidental care is thus done by the consolidation of a wound, or section, or cautery, and the like
And the mode of the operation in this is that you find the consolidation, and that you separate the lips, and put between them a piece of linen, and bind it, until it is healed
And do not use in the care of this that which excites and contracts: for if you do this, the Alxatrati will deteriorate more than before: rather use those things which soften, such as chaff: and mix with water, in which barley is boiled, seed of flax: and oil of lard, which is liquefied with some oil: and apply it with the linen, and care for it
And your skill in the care of this is that you are able to concoct with every ingenuity, so that it does not solidify, according to the form which was in the beginning
And this care, which we have mentioned, is not except for some rectification of the Alxatrati, so that it does not regain the form of the place which was throughout
Of the care of the Alxatrati which is done in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkle or contraction upwards to the right and left
Chapter 123.
The lower part of the head is called the Alxatrati. It is natural and accidental.
It is caused by a wound, or a fracture, or a burn, or things like these
And the way to perform the operation in this case is to take hold of the needle which has two threads, and pass it through the meat from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread comes out at the two extremities of the meat
Then stretch the meat upwards with the needle, and cut the vein with a broad blade. If the outline of the eye returns to its proper position, it is good
If not, take a suture, and pass it through the wound, and tie it with the eye: and find two holes in the inner side of the eye, and let the two ends of the holes come out from two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle: and when they meet they will form the figure of the eye once more. And this is the Greek laudation letter
And remove the meat to the amount of its acute lower angle from the eye which follows the eye-lash And join the separated parts together: sew them with a thread.
Then care for them as we have said, with soothing medicines and ointments, until they heal
And if the Alxatrati occurs from a wound, or a suture, or a burn: then you must find a flat wound under the eyelashes, even as before Then separate the two lips with a liner as we have said.
And thus the conclusion of the discourse concerning the care of Alxatr [i.e. the surgeon] is that when he is above or below, his care in this operation is as it is prepared according to the form of Alxatr.
For there are many varieties in form: and a prudent artificer prepares the ingenuity in whatever way is possible for him, until he brings the figure back to a natural form, or almost so, and even the patient himself, according as it is convenient for him from the operation and the instruments in various arrangements
Chapter 15.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or the cornea.
Whenever such a consolidation happens to many people, it is like the consolidation of the upper eyelid with the white of the eye, and it hinders its natural operations.
You must therefore introduce the extremity of the radius under the eyelid, and lift it up: or stretch it out with a hook: then cut through the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be as acute as the incision of the spatula, but rather blunt and shallow: so that it does not irritate the patient during the operation, and that it may be easily withdrawn, and that the eye may return to its natural shape: and that the adhesion should be entirely healed
Then pour water and salt into the eye, with water washing it out: or instill it from a sieve made from millet seeds boiled in water
Then separate the lip from the eye with a liner of linen: and place above the eye lanolin infused with alum or wool: and on the third day remove the sieve and the solids, until it is healed
On the incision of the nail and the prominence of meat near the tear-ducts.
On the incision of the nail and the prominence of meat near the tear-ducts.
You know that the nail is according to two modes. Or it is fleshy: and is similar to soft wax, thick and brittle Or it is not fleshy, resembling frozen white moisture: which, when it touches iron, or when you try to grasp it with a hook, breaks off and does not remain in it
And both of these kinds do not begin until from the greater tear-duct, until it has proceeded somewhat, until it covers the useful thing, and excludes light and movement of the eye
And the manner of working in its incision is: as you place your diseased head in your lap Then open its eyes, and lift its eyelid with your hand Then gather the nail with a hook a few times, and stretch it upwards. Then take the needle, and pierce the meat through the hair of the horse, and blood, or fat: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle at the base, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce the nail with the needle, and ligate the nail with the thread, and stretch the nail upwards: and remove the skin surrounding the nail which follows the pupil, as if you were scraping the nail with the skin until its extremity
And then cut the rest in the root of the tear-duct with a fine sponge, or with small forceps: and let the natural meat of the tear-duct go, so that it does not impede the course of the tears from its incision.
When the finger is stretched out with only one (digit), or with a thread, as we have said. Then it should be scraped with a soft sponge, the shape of which is as follows.
Take care that the sponge does not touch the tough tunic of the cornea, and that you make an incision in it, and perforate the pupil.
Then, after the incision, pour into the eye some powdered salt, or extract it from barley, and leave it in for another day. And take care of it until it is healed
If the finger is neither nerve nor bone, and does not bend inwards, and does not swell, then this kind of finger heals in many ways with the doctors, and heals as I have said before
If you wish to make an incision, then open the eye of the patient, and take out the tough inner membrane, soft, thin and acute, according to this form And cut off the fingernail above the root with sharpness. If you see that it is becoming rare and crumbling, and has burst in the root, then pour out from your hour glass into the eye from barley, or from red barley, or powdered salt: and anoint the eye until tomorrow
Then repeat the operation until it is completely healed Except that there is a soft callous in the eye: then leave it in and care for the callous until it is healed
Then repeat the operation above with care until it is healed
The prominence of the tear sac, if it is causing great pain in the eye, is to be grasped with one finger, and cut off a part of it: do not make the incision at the end, lest you cause the flow of tears to be blocked
Then stop the bleeding from the tear-gland with a red sponge, or made from sponge-grass, until it heals.
After the excision of the gland and the natural elevation in the eye
From the excision of the gland and the elevation of the tissue in the eye
Sometimes in the eyes of men there is a red substance composed of blood, or superposed, which covers the pupil, approaches or tightens over the eyelashes, and perhaps turns the eyelashes outwards: and it is absorbed like the dust of roses
And there is also an operation for it, that you put your hand over his head. Then open his eyes, and gather all the flesh with the nails that are convenient for that: and hold that with one hand, or grasp it with your hand.
Then cut the flesh at first, until you have finished all of it with the chisel And burn away from the eye, so that you do not damage it during the operation: and make your incision as we said in the excision of the nail: or with fine scissors, with which you collect the fat, as it will appear after this head
When your incision is complete, and you have removed all the gland, then put the eye out from salt that is ground together: or distill into it a powder of red, and things like these from corrosive physicians: and put over the eye a foreign cover with white wool or linen: to prevent from the heat.
If anything remains of the gland, and you dominate the hot blood, and wait for the swelling to subside: then let go of the eye, and care for it with that which will settle the swelling
Then repeat over it with the operation, until it heals.
Proceed in like manner as when meat is added which has happened in the eye from this sort.
Proceed in like manner as when meat is added which has happened in the eye from this sort.
In like manner as when meat has been added and has occurred in the eye of this kind.
Chapter XVIII.
The veins which are red and cover the eye, and which prevent the liquid from operating: and they weaken the eye with the length of the days.
Therefore, first of all, you must consider whether the eye in which there is Sebel is strong and there is no other injury in it except for the Sebel: then collect the Sebel from it
And it is fitting to place your head on your lap
Then suspend those veins with one hook or two, according to your prudence: and let the hook be of fine wire, like a double thread, or two hooks be graduated in one body, like this form.
Then collect with fine forceps those veins with caution, and drain blood an hour after an hour, until you have removed the veins from the eye and they have dissolved: and take care not to damage the eye with the tips of the forceps.
And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be firm in your operation so that you do not cut anything except for the veins
And when you have finished, then instill in the eye a little oil, or blood: so that its sharpness may restore what remains of the Sebel.
If it is not possible to collect the whole in this hour, then plaster the eye with wax, which will soothe the eye's pain. And send it away for a few days until the pain has subsided: and keep it away from a warm compress. And then repeat over it again in the same manner until it is healed.
This is the form of the shears.
On the reduction of the swelling of the nose.
Chapter XIX
Doctors call the swelling of the nose "Fistula," which they cure with cautery or with acute medicine burning, as the case demands
And if it does not heal, then there is no wisdom in that: except that you find a boil on the swelling near its origin, and you extract all the moisture that is in it and pus, until the bone is clean
When the bone is thus extracted, and the cavity is washed, or blackened, then fill it again with the instrument whose form is this
This is called the "Asperation of the head.
Make it of iron, and let its head be round like an azure, which is pierced with the point of a lime, or with the point of an awl, or with a fine puncture: and place it upon the place of the corrupted bone
Then pull it out between your fingers, and you press your hand near, until you know that the corruption is gone: and do it quickly
Then restore the place with medicinal astringents.
If thus the place is consolidated, and there is formed in it flesh, and the swelling subsides: and there remains for forty days, and it does not rise again, and there is no inflammation, and no accident occurs in it: then you know that it is healed
If not, then it is not in the ingenuity of that man, except to reduce the fistula to the opening of the nose, according to this fashion.
If not, then it is not in the ingenuity of that man, except to reduce the fistula to the opening of the nose, in this fashion.
Then place that over the bone itself: and let it be close to the lacrimal gland: and stretch out your hand from the eye a little. Then turn your hand with the thumb, until it penetrates the bone, and feel that it is painful: by this you will know that the air has escaped from it, when you keep your hand over your nose.
Therefore, then restore the place with the physicians who are stifling, as I have taught you.
When the flesh has healed, and the place has hardened: then the matter which flowed outwards returns to the nose: so it is easier to do that over the painful area.
¶ Regarding the reduction of the swelling of the eye.
Chapter XX.
When the eye swells completely, and does not yield to any treatment, neither by reduction nor by medication: then it is necessary to dissolve the swelling: then perform a bloodletting: afterwards place poultices in the cavity without making an incision, but with suction.
Then place over the eye a unguent made from acacia, and aloe, and oil, and gum arabic. Then bind the eye above over the dressing with many sponges.
And the way of making the sponges is: that you take fine sponges, many, and double every sponge over four: make many from them: then place one over another, according to the quantity which the eye needs: then bind over them with strong leather
Repeat the procedure with the stomach using suction without incision.
Repeat the procedure with the stomach, and keep the eye closed for a day and night.
If the ligament is again softened, it must be tightly bound: then remove the ligament after a day and night, as we have said before
If blood therefore escapes from the eye again after the application of the ligature, it is good: but if not, then repeat the application of the dressing, the sponges, the tight dressing, and the suction, until the patient is healed.
Regarding the incision of the abdominal cavity.
Chapter 21
When a disruption occurs in the abdominal cavity, then it will protrude and proceed outside the eyelids like a grain of sand, and will be formed like a man due to that: then it is necessary to make an incision in that place. The operation in this case is as follows: and it is that you insert a needle into the root of the intestine from the lower part to the upper part
Then insert another needle where there is a doubled thread from the lacrimal part, and make it pass through: and remove the first needle according to its position.
Then pierce the place of the doubled thread, and bind it around the part of the intestine with the needle: and tighten it much.
Then remove the needle, and place above the eye a lanolin swab in albumin: and leave it there until the thread is cast out with the intestine
Then care for the eye with it, which comforts it, until the wound is healed
And when the intestine is tightly bound from all around with a circle of cloth, until it has added the eye a great prominence.
Then it is pierced with a fine needle which reaches the depth of the eye, and moisture of albumin flows out, and the eye descends, and immediately fills: then bind it up until it is healed.
Then it is pierced with a fine needle which reaches the depth of the eye, and moisture of albumin flows out, and the eye descends, and immediately fills: then bind it up until it is healed.
Then it is pierced with a fine needle which reaches the depth of the eye, and moisture of albumin flows out, and the eye descends, and immediately fills: then bind it up until it is healed.
This ailment which is called Alcomnati, is not simply an inflammation, but a healing which has gathered in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not the ailment itself.
And the way of dealing with it is to make the patient sit over a prepared seat, or directly
Then take hold of his head with your hands from two parts, and move it around until you see the healing return to the lower part of his eye Then tighten it up, and do not let it descend, and open the pupil: and the patient will see as well as before: and if it does not descend further, you know that it is water
But if the healing of the eye is not prepared to descend with that which we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands Then take a fine needle and pierce with it above the corneal membrane at the circumference where it joins the cornea in a crown, until the healing comes out.
When it has come out, then instill in the eye lukewarm water in which honey has been mixed: or water in which barley flour and honey have been boiled: then treat with the rest of the treatment until it is healed
When it has come out, then instill in the eye lukewarm water in which honey has been mixed: or water in which barley flour and honey have been boiled: then treat with the rest of the treatment until it is healed
Chapter XXIII.
I have spoken of ten kinds of water in the process of irrigation, which are declared and explained by the expert; take them according to the soundness of the patient.
Then you must make the patient sit with his shoulder blades against your hands, opposite the light, near the heel: and bind his eye securely, and tighten it: then take hold of the eyelid of his eye which has the water in it, with your right hand, if the eye which has the water is the left, or your left hand if the eye which has the water is the right.
Then take your right hand with the thumb, if the eye is left: or your left hand if the eye is right.
Then place the thumb at the crown near the apparent white of the smaller lacrimal gland: then push the thumb with force: and you will know when the thumb has gone through to the bottom of the eye socket
And it is necessary that the thumb should reach the depth of the eye socket, measuring the space from the pupil to the end of the black part: which is the cornea of the eye. You will see this in the pupil of the eye, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Then place the thumb until it reaches the place where the water is Then push the lower eyelid downwards one after the other.
If, therefore, water comes down immediately, then the patient should shut his eye immediately and the thumb will be in his eye
Then rest for a little while. If water comes down again, then remove the thumb once more, except when the thumb is coming out
When the limb hangs down and does not rise up: then extract the foreign body easily and you will gradually restore your hand.
Then dissolve in water something from clear salt crystals: and wash with it when the eye is closed. Then place over the eye the whole wad of cotton, or wool soaked in rose-water, and alum: and bind with it the healthy eye
We, however, and those who are with us in this time, place upon it a firm compress with alum.
If it does not yield to the foreign body at the entrance of the eye because of its hardness, because it is from a man whose eye is hard and cold: then you must take a sponge, which is called Alberid, whose shape is like this
Fetch the sponge with the hand itself only, and do not touch the hand with the thumb: and do not do anything except to put the foreign body in its proper place under the eye
Then introduce the foreign body, as we have said
And in addition to that, prepare a soft bed in the center of the room, on which he may lie with his face downwards in a dark room: and prevent all movements, and from coughing: and give him food that soothes his nature: and do not move his head to the right or to the left at all.</start_of_turn>
And keep the dressing in accordance with its custom until the third day.
Then take it out of that dark room and let him see: and make him drink something. Then reduce the dressing until the seventh day.
And do not do this at the hour of treatment, or immediately after the incision: rather do it when others are there: because water ascends quickly through a wide opening
If, however, the boil becomes hardened: then it is necessary to drain the eye before the seventh day. And rectify that with what rests upon it that sits upon the boil until it subsides: then truly to make use of the eye itself, and place over its face an oral bandage which regulates the use of the eye for a few days, even though it exists in the dark room.
The eye must be gradually withdrawn from the room and returned to its place.</start_of_turn>
Know that in the dark one must not be excused from vision for a long time: then indeed he will hear of the operation.</start_of_turn>
And indeed it happened to us some from Alayrach, who said that in Alayrach a magdan was perforated by a needle, through which water was sucked out.</start_of_turn>
Truly, no one in our land has done this: neither have I read of it in any ancient book: and it is possible that it is new.</start_of_turn
These are the forms of the demons which appear from the magda, as they rest upon that which they know not.</start_of_turn
Let them be of their own air: and their extremities be like those of a triangle with the acute angle.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXIII.</start_of_turn
Of the care of the newly born flesh in the nose.</start_of_turn
When various meats are born in the nose of a carnas, from which there is something that is assimilated by many scorpions' feet: and from this there is a cancerous flesh, a stone, of a dusky colour: and from this is what is soft flesh, not of a dusky colour.</start_of_turn
If any flesh from these carnivorous animals is soft, not fraudulent, nor cancerous, you must make the sick man sit with his hands opposite you, open his mouth, and expel the tongue from his flesh: then draw them out to the exterior, and cut off what you have apprehended from them with a fine, acute scalpel from one side, until you know that the whole flesh has been excised.
If anything remains of that from whose excision is impossible: then cut that with a fine instrument easily, until nothing remains of it.</start_of_turn> If blood should dominate it, or a thick clot adhere: then oppose it by that which is appropriate: or that from malignant clots, then cauterize it until the blood is severed, and remove all the flesh.</start_of_turn>
Then expel it through the nose after the incision of the vein, and water, or liquid.</start_of_turn> If indeed the nose is opened, and moisture proceeds from it up to the palate, then you know that he is already healed.</start_of_turn>
If indeed moisture does not penetrate, according to what is appropriate, then you know that flesh has been born within the upper bones of the nose, which does not come out with the incision of the instrument.</start_of_turn
Therefore it is necessary to insert a thread of fine caliber which has some bulk, and to knot it in such a way that there are many knots in it: and put between every knot the quantity of digit, or less: and the patient shall blow out one end of the thread through the nose with the greatest possible force: and he shall expel the stench until it reaches the heel, and depart from his guttur.</start_of_turn>
And many do the like of this like the young boys in the schools: and it is easy for him who wishes it.</start_of_turn>
Then place two extremities of the boy, one which projects above the nose, and the other which remains in the nose. Then secure the flesh with sutures at the points which are in the boy's flesh. Do this until you know that the flesh is again with the knots of the boy.
Then draw out the thread: and place in the nose after the bleeding has ceased a little of the unguent which you drank with the Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment has eaten up all that remains of the flesh
Then place in the end of the matter in the nose a lead cannula for a few days, until he is healed.
If, however, treatment is needed which exceeds this, use something else.
For a head injury make a cautery, with which oil is distilled, and other medicines in the nose, do this of silver, or of brass: which is like the nut of the fennel, opened like a conch shell: and its passage is like that of the reed
And if you wish to make a closed cannula, like a tube.</start_of_turn>
And the tube of the instrument for making a head injury be full, detected: which has a handle at its back, with which you grasp it, when you heat it in oil, or when you wish to take from wax, and from fluxes.
Day 25.</start_of_turn
Many times the eye of the nose is born in the extremity of the nose of Thelus, and it grows large, and increases with the days, until the wound has become like its aspect.</start_of_turn
And therefore it is necessary, that in the beginning of its appearance, it should be cut through in order to evacuate its entirety. Then place above it either a cautery or a burning medicine which is placed in its place
If, however, its incision is delayed until it has become large, then consider whether it is a stone, hard or brown in color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with the iron; for the tumor is cancerous.
For there are many waters which issue from the incision of tumors, and which cause great harm to the body which had them
If, however, the tumor is soft to the touch, not brown in color, and the waters which issue from its incision are possible throughout its entirety, then evacuate the sick person and cut it without fear, without pain: and care for the place where it was excised until it is healed
Chapter 26.
As for the suture of the nose, the lip, and the ear
You know that when a solution of continuity happens in cartilaginous matters, it offers little support in that operation, except in some people.
It is necessary, therefore, when anything happens from that, that you consider whether there is a wound which has been made with blood: and then join the edges of the wound with a suture: then care for it until it is healed
And if the continuous solution of the lips has already been separated, and each part is sound: then it is necessary to scour all the parts from the skin outwards until they bleed again. Then join the lips with a suture, and bind them, and sprinkle above it dragon's blood and balsam: and place above the powder a plaster plug, and some other solid plaster: and leave it bound for two or three days Then solve it yourself, and move the medicine: and let it go, until the threads are severed by themselves. Then care for it with the unguent, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
As for the way of stitching, it is such that it joins the solution of continuity, or with a weight, as we say in the stitching of the belly: or join the solution with the thread, as you have been told.</start_of_turn>
Chapter XXVII.</start_of_turn
Concerning the extraction of lip knots.</start_of_turn
Many people suffer pain in the insides of their lips because of hard bumps resembling seeds of herbs. Some of these are small, and some are large.</start_of_turn
Therefore it is necessary to cover the lips, and find over every bump of it, and suspend it with a thread, and cut it away from all around.</start_of_turn
Then fill the place after the incision with dry wool, until the blood is clotted.</start_of_turn
Then bandage it with vinegar, and care for the place with it, where there is a styptic, until the wound is healed.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXVIII.</start_of_turn
Concerning the incision of the flesh of a newly-formed tooth on the gum.</start_of_turn
Many are born on the gum, flesh added by the ancients, whom they call abuluss.</start_of_turn
Therefore it is necessary to suspend it with a thread: or grasp it with forceps, and cut it at the root of its socket, and let the blood run, or the pus go out.</start_of_turn
Then place upon the site of the wound a piece of beeswax, or other adhesive powders, and soak them.
If the flesh returns to its place after treatment, which often happens, then repeat the incision a second time, and cauterize it: for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter XXIX.</start_of_turn>
Regarding the tooth with iron.
When they gather on the surfaces of the tooth from the inside and outside, and between the gums there are rough and hard coatings, and when they decay, and the dentine becomes soft and greenish, until corruption reaches the gum, and inflammation of the teeth results.</start_of_turn>
It is necessary therefore to keep the hand steady between your thumbs, and to place the head of the instrument in your mouth, and to grasp the tooth and the socket, where you see the coatings, like sand: until something remains from it, and do the same with black pigment, and greenishness, and yellowness, and other things until they are gone.</start_of_turn
If therefore the thing which is in the tooth from the beginning of the treatment is removed, that is good: and if not, then repeat the treatment on the third day, and the fourth, and the fifth, until you have finally completed the study of that which you desire.</start_of_turn>
And you know that teeth need different rasps of various forms, many figures: according to the preparation for your operation: because the rasp which files the tooth from the lower part is different from the rasp which files between the teeth, according to other figures.</start_of_turn
And these figures of rasps are prepared for you, which you will find.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXX.
Chapter XIX.</start_of_turn
The teeth must be cured of their pain with all possible skill, and afterwards their eradication is to be aimed for. There is no remedy for it [tooth pain] which does not vanish when the tooth is eradicated: for its substance is lofty; except when there is no other remedy to be had, then it is permitted that the sick man eradicate it, that it may harden, and that he may be certified by thee that the tooth is painful
Many, indeed, deceive the sick with their pain and assert that it is in the tooth itself and eradicate it: but the pain does not vanish until the diseased tooth is eradicated.
For we do not see that it [tooth pain] departs from the operation of phlebotomy.
When it is certified by thee that the tooth is painful itself, then it is permitted that you sacrifice around the tooth with sponges, in which there is some skill, until the gum is separated from all sides: then move the tooth with thy fingers, or with fine forceps at first slowly, until you have broken it
Then place there [the forceps] in a great location well: and the head of the sick man between thy knees: for it is well held thus, because it does not move: then draw out the tooth according to its right, so that you do not break it.
If it does not come out, then take some of those instruments and introduce it under it from all sides with ease, and move it, as you did at first.
If the tooth is perforated or corroded: then it is permitted that you fill that hole with wool: and string it with the extremity of a fine radius, so that it does not break in the hour of your constriction over it with the forceps.
And it is permitted that you should take great care with the scarring around the gum from all parts much
Be strong and resolute, lest you break yourself, and let a part of you remain, so that you may depart from the infirmity greater than the pain which was in it at first.
Do not attempt that which you know not, for phlebotomists in their frenzy often do harm rather than good. Be courageous in its extirpation, but let us administer what we have narrated
Many indeed make their wounds grow worse by touching great illnesses of men, for the greater part of them is liable to break, and leave roots of themselves behind, or to draw out the whole with some bones of the jaw: as we have been told.
Then it is to be closed with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
If there is a discharge of blood from the place (for many indeed thus happen), then there is something from the vessel there, and implement with it the place: and if not, cauterize it if it does not suffice to restore the vessel.
The forceps which are used to grasp the tooth in the first place should be of fine form, their handles long, their thumbs short, their bodies broad, so that they do not bend when pressure is put on them when they are pressed against the tooth: they should be like strong fingers, until when they are bound to the tooth, they do not bite the tooth itself, neither do they bend: the handles should be short, and they should be made of iron, or of well-fashioned steel, with directed handles, and in their handles there should be teeth, some of which are retained in some way, and which bind the constriction loosely, strongly
And when the handles are of such a shape as the beak of a bird which is called a ciconia, and are strong, there are strong constrictions.
Chapter 1.
On the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of fractured bones of the jaw
When the tooth remains at the root, and breaks something, then it is necessary that you place butter over the place of the tooth for one or two days, until the place is softened: then introduce into the cavity a sponge or forceps: the extremities of which absorb the pulp which is called ciconia. This is the form of the forceps.</start_of_turn>
Their extremities are made like a file or like an awl.</start_of_turn>
If, therefore, they do not yield to these forceps, then it is necessary that you place the jaw over the root, and remove the whole flesh, and introduce an instrument which is called a small spatula, which is shaped like this.</start_of_turn
The handle of the instrument should be short and broad: and it should not be wet, lest it break.</start_of_turn
If the root comes out through that, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to bite with these instruments again.</start_of_turn
The first triangle of the extremity has some thickness.</start_of_turn
The second triangle of the extremity is thin.</start_of_turn
And with other instruments and materials which are necessary for the reason of the teeth.</start_of_turn
It is also necessary to bite with this instrument which absorbs a large bone, of this shape, triangular extremity rotated, which has some thickness, so that it does not break: and it should not be wet.</start_of_turn
Know that the instruments for teeth are many: and like the rest of the instruments, they do not all work in the same way. And a skillful craftsman, skilled in his art, will himself discover the appropriate instrument for each operation and its related ailments.
For since the ailments for which instruments are needed are diverse, the ancients did not speak of a single instrument for all of them
If, however, the jawbone is fractured from the mandible, or from any other bone of the mouth, or if it becomes putrefied: then one must examine the area carefully with the instruments and forceps that I mentioned in the extraction of teeth, and handle it with care, for its form is like this
And let there be something of length in it, so that it may be tied up or held with the bone, and that it does not slip away and break, until the bone has been extracted: and restore the place with the physicians who are suitable for that.
If, however, there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then remove it from its putrefaction and care for it, until it is healed.
End of book.
Concerning the closure of teeth that protrude over others.
When teeth protrude abnormally from their natural course, a wound is made by that which gives them that shape: and especially when it happens in women and girls, because of their soft gums.
It is necessary therefore to take care of this For if a tooth has been born after another tooth and has not been positioned, or if it is possible to close it, or to file it down: then extract it: and if it is connected with another tooth, then cut it away with this instrument which has this shape
It is like a small face, and is made of iron, with acute extremities.
And let your incision be such as you would make in many days, because of the hardness of the teeth, and that it does not break through the teeth of others.
If, however, there is an exposure of the edges of the teeth: then ligate the teeth with a file made of iron, whose form is like this.</start_of_turn>
It is all of iron, and its handle has small points like a file: like a file with which the tooth is ground little by little in many days with ease, so that it does not break through the tooth, and falls out: then soften it, and afterwards polish it with some abrasives.</start_of_turn
If there is a tooth from which a part has broken off, and has wounded the tongue: then it is necessary to ligate it also, until the sharpness of that fracture has gone, and it is equal: and flatten it, so that it does not wound the tongue, or corrupt the speech.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 33.</start_of_turn>
¶ As for the reposition of teeth with gold wires.
When it happens that the front teeth have concussion and displacement from a blow, or in a case: and it cannot be held together by the teeth themselves so that it does not fall out: and if swelling appears with blood clots, and treatment does not suffice: then wisdom dictates that they be bound with gold wire: because silver is easily tarnished and putrefies after a few days: but gold never changes.</start_of_turn
And let the wire be of moderate thickness and strength according to the quantity that it can grasp between the teeth.</start_of_turn
And the form of the reposition is that you take hold of the wire, and pass through a loop of it between two healthy teeth: then you tie it with two extremities of the wire between the teeth that are loose, whether one or more, until you have secured it until you reach the other healthy tooth.</start_of_turn Repeat the procedure until you reach the part from which you commenced. Then grasp your hand with caution and wisdom, until it ceases to move forward: and establish your constriction as you would string a thread at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip away.
Repeat the procedure until you reach the starting point. Then grasp your hand cautiously and with wisdom until it ceases to move forward: and establish your constriction as you would string a thread at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip away.
If it is dissolved or if it breaks, string them together with another thread and keep them stable for the whole time.
This is the form of teeth, and the figure of the rotation of two healthy teeth and two moving teeth, like water
And when it has happened that one tooth or two have fallen out due to an abscess or other cause in their places, and they have returned as we have said, and remain: this does not happen except by an artificer, a prudent and experienced person.
And when some bone or cartilage has been adjusted: and it is made like a tooth in shape, and is placed in its place, from which the tooth was extracted and stringed as we have said: and it remains, and serves its purpose for a long time
Chapter 34.
When this ligament which is under the tongue happens naturally, as it is when a human is born, or accidentally, due to an injury which has healed over
And the operation in this case is to open the mouth of the patient in your hand, and elevate the tongue: then cut through that nerve of the ligament throughout its width, until the tongue is freed from its retention
If there be anything hard and nodular in it, and if that be from the consolidation of a wound: then project into that the hook, and find that by its breadth, until you cut through the ligament, and the nodulation will be dissolved.
Take heed, that there be no fissure in the depth of the flesh, and cut through the artery there, and blood flow will be restored.
Then collect in the wound the residue of the incision with rose-water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Then put under the tongue a bandage of linen, which will hold the patient firm throughout the night: so that it will not solidify again
If blood flow should happen to be restored, then put upon the place a wet compress.</start_of_turn> If blood boils, then cauterize the place with a blunt cautery, which is appropriate for this: then care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 5.</start_of_turn>
When there happens under the tongue a swelling which assimilates the small ranula, prohibiting the tongue from its natural operation: and perhaps it increases so much, that it fills the mouth.</start_of_turn
The operation in this is, that you open the mouth of the patient at the root of the tongue: and consider the swelling.</start_of_turn
If there be blood of a dark or reddish color, hard, which the patient does not sense: do not touch it, for it is cancer.</start_of_turn
And if it inclines to whiteness, where there is moisture, then project into it the hook, and cut through it with a fine scalpel, and free it from all around.</start_of_turn If blood flows upon thee in the hour of thy operation, then place upon it a dry sponge, until the blood is severed: then return to thy operation, until thou hast extracted it with its complement.
And bind it with vinegar and salt: and care for the rest with such treatment as is fitting for this, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of the two wounds of the amygdala.
Chapter XVI.
When they happen between the gullet of the gods, that is, the glands which resemble almonds, which happen outside: and which are called two amygdalae: when you have cured them with what we mentioned in the discourse, and they do not heal, then consider them
If there is a hard wound, of a dark color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron
And if it is red in color, and its root is large: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, rather leave it alone, until it is healed And then you will either perforate it: or it will rupture by itself
And if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin: then you must cut it off.
And the operation in this is as you consider before your operation, if the wound of it has grown cold peacefully complete, or if there is imminent decrease: then do this: make the patient sit with his head towards the sun: and open the wound of him, and take hold of the flesh between your hands, and pull the tongue downwards with an instrument, which has this shape
Make from silver, or from air, which is subtle like a knife.
When thus you have said the word and the limb is exposed, and falls upon the part you wish to reach: then grasp the hook and hold it in safety, and draw it outwards as much as you can, without tearing anything from the tunics.
Then proceed with the instrument whose form follows this. Like scissors: truly the extremities of these are bent inwards, so that the opening of each is directly opposite the other at an angle: where care must be taken lest it should slip from the iron or be soaked in alum.
If however this instrument is not present, then proceed with the sponge, whose form is like this It is acute from one part, not from the other part.
And after you have incissated one side of the flesh, incissate the other according to this same kind of incision
Then let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
If however blood flows from him, make him gargle with water in which coriander seeds are boiled: or leaves of myrtle, and things like these from sponges: until the bleeding ceases: then care for him until he is healed.
And when there are left in the gullet other abscesses, besides the two tonsils. Proceed with these in the same way as for the two tonsils.
And indeed I have cured a woman of an abscess which was in her throat, which was bringing her to a fainting spell, with little sense, because she was swallowing with difficulty: and the woman breathed with difficulty through a narrow passage, and I forbade her from eating and drinking: and she died within one or two days.
And the after-pulse will ascend only as much as two branches emitted, until they go beyond two nostrils.
And the after-pulse will ascend only as much as two branches emitted, until they go beyond two nostrils. And then I draw it out, and from that part is a great portion taken out
And then I cut it off at the root of the nose
And then I do the same for the other nostril.
And then I open its mouth, and press its tongue: and afterwards I fix the hook in the after-pulse: then I cut off a part of it, and there does not flow much blood from it: it is absolutely like the gut of a woman, and immediately starts to drink water, and then accepts food
It does not cease to cut from that after-pulse for a long time: and the after-pulse follows the place from which I cut, until it becomes prolonged and joins with it.
I devised, and cauterized the after-pulse between the gut
It remained from the addition: then I went away from the place, and I do not know what God did with it after me
On the incision of a small after-pulse.
Chapter 7
When catarrus descends to the lower part and there is an after-pulse, and it is long: then it is called a perpendicular one: and if it is in the lower part large and round, then it is called a great one
When it is cured with what we said in the explanation, and the cure does not suffice: and you see that the after-pulse has become soft and quiescent from it: then it is necessary to cut it off
And whatever is gathered round that is round, and has no length, and is blood-stained, or of a dusky colour, or black, and has no sensation: in such a case it is necessary to make an incision of it. And there is fear of the disease upon the patient.
It is necessary therefore when you are performing the cure as I have mentioned from the white, and of its length, so that you make the patient sit forward facing the sun: and you will grasp his tongue with an instrument whose passage was mentioned before, and fix the flesh in one place, and draw it downwards: and cut through it with one of the two instruments which I mentioned in the incision of two abscesses.
And it is necessary that you do not cut from that, except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition
For if you cut from that more, you will wound the bowels and the speech.
And then after the incision use what we mentioned in the incision of two abscesses: and care for him until he is healed.
If however the patient returns from the incision: then it is necessary that you use your skill in cauterization without fear and without hesitation.
And the method of cauterization in this is not with anything except with acute water: and it is that you place the head of the patient in your lap. And then grasp his tongue with the instrument which we mentioned before. And then take from the water which I mentioned before and mix with burnt charcoal, and place it not thick, neither sparse, and touch it from that side which has the concave shape of this instrument
So that its extremities are in that side which holds the medicine in a concave way, like the concave shape of the radius of a conch shell
Place the instrument with the medicine above the wound: and let the patient lie with his side open, so that the discharge from his mouth may flow out from within the medicine, so that it does not descend to the gut of the patient, and cause him pain.
Then hold your hand with the medicine.</start_of_turn> And you from the first touch it over the wound for the quantity of half an hour, until you see that it has become softened, and rest the biting pain of the medicine.</start_of_turn>
And if you wish to take hold of the limb, and cover it with the medicine over the end of the radius, and inflate the limb with medicine, and insert the radius into the cannula above, until the limb adheres to the wound.</start_of_turn
Do this many times, until you complete what you wish concerning the cautery of the vein.</start_of_turn> Then remove the medicine: for it itself will dry and fall off in three days, or four.</start_of_turn
And if you think that the medicine has not been digested, repeat it: and after the cautery, remove the surrounding skin of the vein with the finger, and soak it in butter, and bandage it with that which is around it from the medicine: and cool it with cold water.</start_of_turn
And care for the outside with stitches, and for the inside with gargles, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Thus is this kind of treatment safer than an incision and longer lasting in fear.</start_of_turn>
And when the wound is healed even with the subtlest of cautery and incision: it is healed by fumigation, according to this method.</start_of_turn Take calamine, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and sassafras, and chamomile, and wormwood, and similar herbs: and mix them all together, or some of them in a pot, and immerse them in vinegar, and boil: and cover the pot with a lid: and put a hole in the middle of the pot, above which is made a concave instrument according to this method.</start_of_turn
Let air or metal enter: and the extremity is introduced into the cavity containing the pomegranate, until the vapor ascends to the upper opening of the cannula, until the opening is obscured by much.
Then repeat over the same [procedure] several times, until it heals.
And beware, do not perform this treatment in the beginning of an attack of inflammation. The procedure is useful only in a cold inflammation: and it must not be performed except when the inflammation has subsided.</start_of_turn>
If however this instrument is not present, then take a needle and make a hole in the extremity and introduce cork or resin: so that it does not burn the bone: because the cork or resin hinders the vapor from burning the bone: and this is a good treatment with safety.</start_of_turn>
Regarding the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter 38.</start_of_turn>
Many things adhere to the throat, such as bones of fish or thorns.</start_of_turn>
It is necessary therefore to extract what is seen to have fallen into the throat, after having previously drawn the tongue with an instrument at the angle of the jaw, and to declare that it is in the throat.</start_of_turn
And what is not seen but is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make the patient vomit before food is eaten in the stomach.</start_of_turn Perhaps therefore it will be discharged through vomiting.</start_of_turn
Or the patient swallows a piece of poppy seed, or the root of licorice, or swallows a piece of dry bread: or grasps a piece of dry sea sponge and binds it with a thread, then swallows it.</start_of_turn When the limb approaches the place where the bones or spines are extracted, it is then driven out.
If it does not come out spontaneously as we have said: then use an instrument of lead according to this fashion.
Let it be thicker than the radius of a bean, and at its end there must be a curvature, which intrudes into its gut with ease: and it must have its head elevated above
Beware of its touch to the epiglottis, that it does not cause him to cough, and drive with it bone, or spine, or the doctor himself must introduce it with his hand.
But that the patient should introduce it himself: this is better: because of his knowledge of the place of the annexed thing: and he drives downwards, or pulls his hand upwards with the instrument, the whole thing according to the quantity that is prepared for him, until it comes out
Of the extraction of the blood vessel.

When the bleeding vessel is being treated with that which I have mentioned in the treatise on the treatment of wounds by the hands of doctors, and it does not stop, then consider in the belly of the patient at the root of the tongue, or behind the tongue after you have withdrawn the tongue with the instrument that I mentioned.
If your hand slips upon the bleeding vessel, grasp it with a small clamp, or with fine forceps from the center
If this is not possible with these: then take a curved needle, and introduce it into the belly of the patient near the gut: then introduce the needle into the cavity of the needle with burning iron with fire Do this several times: and the patient should abstain from all water for the whole day.
Then he shall take a full measure of cold water and open his mouth wide with it: and he shall lick his own bone with it, and swallow nothing from it: and he shall drink water an hour after the other with his hand. The bloodsucker is like him who feels the water falling from his hand.
But if he does not go away when we tell him, then we must fumigate the patient with mice, or with a sponge as an instrument which I mentioned in the fumigation of the wound
Do this many times, for it itself goes away.
And the mode of operation in fumigation is that you take a vessel in which there are dates with fire: and the vessel be covered with a cover, in the middle of which is a hole: and make in that hole the end of the instrument.
Then he throws the fumigation and places the patient's bone at the end of the tube and closes the bone, so that it does not escape the fumigation, until you know that the fumigation has gone away from the bloodsucker For the bloodsucker immediately goes away.
And if it does not go away, then repeat the fumigation many times
And the patient can tolerate the sitting position, and he can eat onions and garlic, and he must not drink water.
It is necessary therefore that he go away with this regimen.
And this is the fashion of the instrument with which the bloodsucker is drawn out from the gut when it falls upon the wound.
It is like pincers, thus: except that it has that curvature which enters into the gut And its extremity is like the wing of an ostrich, which is called a ciconia, in which there is a roughness of the lime: when it grasps something, it does not relinquish it entirely.
And concerning the opening of abscesses, their section, and their care in general.
Chapter 40.</start_of_turn>
Abcesses are of various kinds, depending on the nature of the cause, for there are many causes of abscesses: and they differ in their perforation and their section in two ways.</start_of_turn>
One kind of abscess is that which arises from humidity.</start_of_turn
The other kind is that which arises from the body itself.</start_of_turn
For an abscess which arises in the head is different from that which arises in the belly: and an abscess which arises in a fleshy part is different from that which arises at a joint. And each one of these has its own judgement according to its operation.</start_of_turn
Some abscesses do not need to be perforated until after the decay of the matter and the completion of its process: and others need to be perforated while they are still raw and have not completed their process.</start_of_turn
Like abscesses which are close to a joint.</start_of_turn
For an abscess which arises near a joint and persists, until it has decayed, may perhaps corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint: which is the cause of the contraction of that limb.</start_of_turn
Or an abscess which is in a limb: for if you delay its perforation until it has matured, it will cause pain or swelling or both in that limb.</start_of_turn
If it is close to the anus, perforate it immediately: and it is not fitting to perforate a crude stool that is not completely digested, except when it is close to the anus, lest it putrefy deeply and extend inwards of the rectum, and form a fistula, or remain unhealed at its end.
It is necessary that you know the time of perforation of the stool, which is matured according to its completion: and it is with sedation of pain, recession of fever, and reduction of redness, and pulse, and an increased intensity of the head of the stool: and the rest of the signs.
It is necessary that you make the perforation in a lower place of the stool, and more prominent: and let the perforation be wide in length of the body, if the stool is in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of laceration, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all the places where there is no reflection
But in those which reflect, do cautiously with the perforation according to that member.
When indeed the stool is in the places of hardness: then it is better that you delay the perforation of it until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to completion
Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the disease from it is prolonged, and there is much dirt and putrefaction, and possibly the lips of the wound will be prolonged, and its depth.
And some stools are perforated according to the breadth of the body by necessity: or according to that which the member requires.
And it is necessary that you manage in the small stools a moderate perforation, and in the large stools a wide perforation: or many sections similar in magnitude to the stool.
And there are from the apostemata, in which it is necessary that the skin should be concaved: and it happens when it is already made like a panus, and is made at the end, when it is already dead: as it happens with many things, as with dubelet, and with bubonibus.
And there are from those which are cut with a section having three angles And there are from those which are cut like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like the apostema of the inguinal region
And there are from those in which a round section and a lunar section are administered: and similar things from sections.
That which does not have a head, like the superficial leninous apostemata, must be pierced through a superficial perforation, or only planely
And it must be when the apostema is thick, and when there is much surrounding healthy tissue, that you perforate it, that you do not damage it and extract all the pus in that hour: rather extract from it a part of it Then anoint the apostema until the next day. Then extract some of the pus again.
Do this many times according to the degree, until the patient is expelled: especially if the patient is feeble in spirit, or a woman in childbirth, or a young child, or an old man decrepitus: for the spirit of the animal is resolved from the animal with the expulsion of the health: and perhaps the patient will die, and you will not perceive it
Beware therefore this chapter has great caution
And after you have perforated the apostema, which is what you do to the apostemata, you must remove the slime: and consider If there is a small abscess of a vein, either cut it off level with the surface or ligate the vein above. If there is a large abscess and many holes of perforation, it is necessary to insert into each hole a ligature until they reach the innermost part.</start_of_turn>
If you have cut away a part of the skin in the abscess, or if you have cauterized around it: then you must put in an old dressing, or as when a bandage is taken off, or cover it with dry wool: and hold it in place until the third day.</start_of_turn>
Then remove it and care for it until it has healed.</start_of_turn>
If however blood flows in your operation in this hour: then administer cold water and vinegar, after you have swallowed it with a piece of bread: and put it over the place where the blood is flowing profusely.</start_of_turn
If the bleeding persists, then you must administer treatment, care, and powders, which I have narrated in many places of this book, and from experience.</start_of_turn
If it is winter and the place of the abscess is full of nerves: then you must instill small sponges with wine and warm fat: and put them over the place.</start_of_turn
And if it is summer and the place is fleshy: then you must put sponges soaked in water and fat, or in wine and fat, and all of this cold.</start_of_turn> Until then, as we have said, on the third day you must drain the abscess, evacuate it, and administer to its care what is suitable for it until it has healed.</start_of_turn
This is therefore necessary from the knowledge of the cure of apostemata universally.
According to the method, indeed, of discernment, as I have said concerning every apostematum, how it is possible to achieve its cure is set out individually
Chapter 41
Concerning the section of apostemata which occur in the head.
There occur in the head small apostemata, and they are of the kind of knots which contain tunica, which are like sacks: as if they were themselves little poultry houses.
And their species are many
Some are fat: and some contain moisture like mud: and some contain moisture like sweat and pus: and others like these, and there are those which are hard stones
And in the section of all of them, and in their extraction, there is no fear, as long as during their section it does not make an opposite to the artery
And the operation in their section is as one must experience with the instrument which comes after this, which is called Intromissum, until you know what it contains
For if it contains moisture, then dry it out by the superficial section: in this way.
And begin with the section from line b to line g. When therefore the moisture has been evacuated, then remove the knot which contains it, and do not leave anything behind it
For many return if anything remains of it
Then immerse the head in Egyptian unguent, if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and apply with it a willow, and remove it until the next day The substance itself consumes that which remains of the cyst.
Repeat over the substance with the aegyptio secondus, thirdus, and if it does not yield, until you are confident that nothing remains of the cyst, then indeed take care of the wound with unguentum until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
If the swelling contains a pimple, then dry it out in this fashion, by cutting it through in the shape of a cross: and project the nails between the two cuts, and scour it from all sides: and attempt your skill in the extraction of the membrane which contains it.</start_of_turn
If, however, it opposes you, the artery, then do that which I shall tell you afterwards.</start_of_turn>
Do the same with a stone swelling, by cutting through it, and treating it in the same way as before.</start_of_turn
And the cutting through a stone swelling is easier: because there is little blood and moisture.</start_of_turn And sometimes there are certain hours of swellings which are in the head of certain people, in which there is no moisture at all.</start_of_turn
That is: because I dried out the swelling in the head of a maidservant, and I found the swelling just like a solid stone, hard, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if I pierced it with anything, it would burst.</start_of_turn
In other swellings of the head, except for these which happen in the heads of children, and at the roots of the ears, the incision should be superficial.</start_of_turn>
Or make the perforation always from below upwards, so as to aid the course of healing downwards.</start_of_turn
Then care for it with whatever is necessary from the cure.
Then care for it with whatever is necessary from the cure.
Then care for it with whatever is necessary from the cure.
Then care for it with whatever is necessary from the cure. Many of these post-traumatic swellings occur in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
And concerning those things which happen in the neck from the above-mentioned causes, there is one, or many: and they are generated from the bone. And every swelling of the Strophula is within its own tunic, as in the nodes and the swellings of the head, as we have mentioned
And there are many kinds of these swellings of the Strophula And from these things there are soft ones: and there are those which contain humours: and there are malignant ones which do not obey treatment
In this way, if a good-dispositioned liquid is found in the touch, which is evident by its proximity to the colour of the skin, and which moves to every part and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, the thyroid, or the arteries, or is not deep: it must be cut away from the upper part towards the lower part of the body along a line, from below the jawline to the groin, and the two lips of the skin should be extended with a single or with multiple sutures, if necessary, as is done in the swelling of the head, and the substance should be gradually extracted.</start_of_turn>
And it is important to be cautious so that no bone or nerve is injured.</start_of_turn
And let the incision not be too acute, so that it does not cause you to move your hand with the incision, or frighten the patient, and cut only what is necessary.</start_of_turn
If, however, you cut a vein or artery, or are forbidden by the operation, then put in the wound a lump of charcoal, or some powder which separates the blood, and bind up the wound, and let it rest until the pain subsides, and the wound is softened: or else it will begin to putrefy.
For the blood is separated by this. Return therefore to your operation until you have completed it
Then inquire with your index finger whether anything remains of the other troches: if so, cut easily, and wash it clean.
If it is in the root of the trochee a large bone: then it is necessary that you do not cut that trochee from its root: rather it is necessary that you bind it with a strong doubled thread, and let it go until it falls down by itself without any support.
Then apply the wound to the outer side, which you have submerged in Egyptian unguent. Then take care of it.
If the trochee is cut throughout, then it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound: and hold them in place immediately, after you have washed because if it has gone too far it will not remain superfluous.
If, however, you have washed because there remains superfluous blood because of the size of the trochee, then it is necessary that you insert your finger into the root of it and extract it: and administer the suture as we said
And what is contained in the troches, moisten it with a small perforation: that you may see the seat of its maturity: and put the perforation from this which follows below the body, as we said
Then administer after the perforation a bandage with unguent, and similar things, so that it may consume what remains of the corruption, until when you have washed the wound is clean: then take care of it with the generation of meat, until it is healed.
On the excision of the epiglottis from the apostemate within the guttur by chance.
On the excision of the epiglottis from the apostemate within the guttur by chance.
The ancients say that they performed this excision of the epiglottis in the guttur, and none of them in our land ever performed it: this is the report of their speech.
In cases of spasms, however, the excision of the epiglottis must be performed: when no other remedy proves effective: for all veins and the lung are weakened by this.
In those who have a hard swelling in the mouth, or gut, or two abscesses, when there is no inflammation in the channel, it is necessary to perform the excision of the epiglottis to escape from the impending destruction caused by the swelling
It is necessary therefore, when we wish to perform this, to cut through the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision through the thickness, in that place where there is cartilage between two circles as much as in the cartilage itself: and this is a suitable place for the incision, because it is bare of flesh and the blood vessels from it are long.
If the physician is timid, then it is necessary to extend the skin of the guttur with a finger Then find the skin, until it reaches the channel: there will be blood vessels if anything leaks out
Then cut through the cartilage as we have said: and it is known from the discharge of phlegm from it when it is ruptured, and from the cutting of the vocal cords.
And let go of the wound at some time.
When the limb is moved at the hour when the focus departs, gather two lips of the wound together and sew them alone without cartilage.
Then apply medicines which cause the flesh to heal, until the wound is healed.
Albucasis said it. This is all that Albucasis has said on this matter. The exposition is not sufficient, except when the time of the setting of the sun has passed, since the patient has already departed this life, and wishes to pass beyond this life: he will grasp towards the epiglottis in order to breathe, and will expire from the wound.  Therefore it is commanded to shut the wound until the mischief of the disease has passed, which is for three days, or almost as long as that: then indeed we shall shut the wound and treat it until it is healed
And this which I have seen myself: a handmaid took a knife and put it into the patient's gut, and it went through a part of the windpipe.
I was called to care for him, and I found him foaming like a dead man.
I saw the wound, and I found blood which had flowed out of the wound of the little finger I am perplexed, for neither the wound itself nor the instruments have gone awry: the wind was going out of the wound
I treated him, and closed the wound, and cared for him until he was healed: and the handmaid did nothing else, except spit in the water: and she returned after a few days in better health.
Henceforth, know this: there is no fear of the epiglottis in the section of the wound
On the section of the hernia of the gutturis.
On the section of the hernia of the gutturis.
This appendix is called the hernia of the gutturis, is a large hernia, according to the colour of the body: and it is much in women.
And it is according to two ways: either it is natural: or it is accidental
In the natural one there is certainly no lesion.
Accidental, however, it is according to two ways: one of which is like a swelling of fat nodules And the other way is like an appendix which arises from the swelling of an artery And in this there is fear, and it does not seem right to assume it with iron, except in the case that it is slight: and you must prove it and investigate it with an incision. If indeed you find it like a swelling of fat, and it is not suspected with any ulcer: then dry it up like swellings of fat are dried up: and extract it with that which contains the cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then explore the whole of it Then take care of the place with it which should be cured, until it is healed
Of the section of the super-species of knots
Of the section of the super-species of knots.
There are many species of knots, and I have mentioned all of them in their division: and it is necessary to say here the difference between a knot and an extrusion, when there is doubt
I say, therefore, that when an extrusion has become cold, and fever, and pain which are causing distress, until the ebullition of excess has subsided, and putrefaction is completed: then the fever and heat will cease
When the node is not hot, neither feverish, nor painful, it contains humours that are like sacs, proper to themselves, and are according to the colour of the body: and their beginning is like millet, and they make like bataches, and are greater and less.
And they are according to two kinds: either fat: or they contain moisture. And the colours of moisture are many, as I said in the preceding discourse
It is necessary therefore, when you are performing the cure of the Node, to experience it, and to inquire about it at first with the instrument which is called the Intromissum, according as its form will appear in the chapter which follows.
And the way of inquiring afterwards, and of all Nodes, is that you take this instrument and introduce it into the moist place which you find in the apostemate: and you draw back your fingers gradually, until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin Then finally touch your hand according to the measure of the size of the apostemate.
Then withdraw the Intromissum, and consider what comes out in the stain of its wound
If therefore it comes out running moisture, whatever its colour be: then dry it with a superficial section, according as I said in the other apostemata.
And if it does not come out running moisture in the stain of the Intromissum, then you know that it is fat: dry it therefore with a section having the form of a cross, according to this form: as I have taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and scrape the skin from all around with ease: and keep the sac if you see it above that.
If however it is broken in the sac during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole: much happens in this case, then extract it broken, until nothing remains of it.
If anything remains from it, little or much, it returns to Node according to most.
If anything remains from it, little or much, it returns to Node according to most.

Experience is also found with black lead, which unites so that through them experience fistulas, whose cavities reflect like them with their smoothness.
There are three kinds of experience remaining For as from these [three kinds] are long, medium, and short, according to the quantity of the breadth of the fistula and the tightness of its structure.
The form of the [fistulas] is various, and there are many kinds.
For as from these [four kinds] are simple, which has one curve: and there are three kinds like liquids, great, medium, and small
And from these are blind fistulas: and there are three kinds of them
And from these are double fistulas having two curves, and there are three kinds of them: and from these are triple fistulas having three curves, and there are three kinds of them: and all of these are necessary in their place.
These are the forms of scalpels, which cut and scrape nodes, and abscesses: and there are three kinds of them, for as from these are large, medium, and small
Their extremities which are cut are acute, their other extremities are not acute: and they are not put in such a way except when with these [instruments] an incision is made in the node in fear of the vessel, or the nerve: and that it may heal in peace, and that it may find tranquility after the removal of the cause of the inflammation than after its incision
They are formed from air, and are similar to radium, with which alcohol is made: and at their wide end is a hidden Spatumilis point: and in this runs inwards and outwards when desired, like liquids.
The shape of the spatula which are passed between the fingers at the perforation of the apostem: these are not perceived by the sick; and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
The form of the spatulas with which the flow of blood is broken: these are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Let them be of air or of citrine, round in shape, of equal length, like wax: and let them be firm.
And it is necessary that these spatulas be of three kinds: large and small: in order that you may break the blood quickly at need, and when there is no physician present.
Truly, you must not use these instruments for the breaking of blood in any part of the body, and must not use them except in places where there is carnation: such as wounds of the leg, and hip, and wounds of the arm, and breast, and belly, and groin, and similar wounds, from carnation, humors.
And sometimes other small instruments like the bristles of brushes are made from these instruments of a similar form: with which the blood is broken when it flows out from the site of phlebotomy, or at the incision of the vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made from these instruments of a round shape like this
Chapter XLVII.
And concerning the care of the breasts of women who are nursing infants
When the breasts of some men swell because of sleep (that is, when they begin to become soiled in sleep) until they resemble the breasts of women: and they remain with a posterior wound of the nipple.
Whoever dislikes this should cut across the breast with a lunar section, according to this shape from the line A to the line B. Then scrape off the fat all around After that, an olive oil is brought from the medicine of the incisions. Then two lips of the wound are closed with a suture, and it is cared for until it heals.</start_of_turn>
If, however, the nipple declines towards the lower parts, and is softened because of its size, as often happens with women: then it is necessary to find two points on the two upper sides of the wound, similar in shape to a half-moon, each one containing the other at the end of each, until a line greater contains a smaller one, following this shape from the line, b. to the line, g. Afterwards scrape the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said concerning the suture and powders, which is necessary for the cure, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
If, however, you do not wish to open the incision because of the patient’s anxiety or because of the flow of blood: then it is necessary to apply an olive oil soaked in vinegar to the wound and leave it, until that which remains of the fat has rotted away.</start_of_turn Then care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
As for the perforation of the apostemate, which happens under the title of Titillico.</start_of_turn>
Chapter XLVIII.</start_of_turn
These apostemata which happen under the title of Titillico are of the kind of hard Stropharia, which contain cysts, and from these are those which contain moisture.</start_of_turn
Which are from those which contain moisture, it is necessary to cut in a lunar shape, following this shape from the line b. to the line g. and when all that is in the apostemate from the blood has been evacuated, then apply an ointment to the old wound and leave it until the next day.</start_of_turn
Then the limb is raised up, and is cared for with an unguent that is suitable for it, until it is healed.
If the swelling should be from a kind of knot of the Strophular kind, then it is to be cut through above it, as we said in the section on the Strophulas which are equal
If, however, a limb swells in this way as to emit pus, then in that case apply cautery to it, as we said before
Chapter XLIX.
As for the cutting through of a swelling that has arisen from an artery or a vein.
When an artery is ruptured, and the skin above it is consolidated, then many times a swelling arises from the limb: and in the same way a swelling arises from a vein, as it does in this limb from the swelling and inflation
And the signs by which it is known that the swelling and inflation are from an artery and a vein, are these: for when the swelling is from an artery, it is long and gathered in the depth of the body: and when the swelling is from an infected limb, you feel as though there is a constriction there
And that which is from a vein is round in the open part of the body
The cutting through of such a swelling is an error, especially if it is below the armpits, and the groin, and the throat, and in many parts of the body: and it is a great danger. Therefore it is necessary to take care of it with iron, and that which is also in the extremities, or in the head, it is necessary to take care of it
As for that which is from the infection of the opening of the artery, find in the cutting through of the skin in the length Then open the part with hooks, afterwards the artery: and free the latter from the tunics until it is severed.
Then introduce a hook under it and make it penetrate until the other side, and tighten the artery with a double thread in two places, as you were taught concerning the extraction of two arteries in the temporal region.
Then puncture the place which is between two ligaments with the sponge, until blood that is in it all comes out, and the clot is dissolved.</start_of_turn>
Then apply a dressing which generates pus, until the ligaments fall away: afterwards care for that with suitable bandages until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
If there should be a clot on account of the cutting of a vein, then you must take hold of your hand as much as is possible from the clot with the skin.</start_of_turn> Then introduce a hook under the place where you held your hand, and make it penetrate: and be in it a double thread, until you pull it out from the other side.</start_of_turn Then tie with this the clot with a strong ligature: as I have told you concerning the ligature of a vein, from two parts with two extremities of thread.</start_of_turn
If however you fear that the thread is pulled out, then introduce another hook with another thread under the whole clot at the incision of the needle: before that, and tighten your thread in four places.</start_of_turn
Then dry the clot in its middle, until when it comes out what is in it: then cut away the surplus of skin, and discharge what is ligated from that.</start_of_turn
Then place above it a little ball which you have immersed in wine, and fat.</start_of_turn Then manage the treatment, which is done with licenses and unguents, until healed.

And indeed I saw a man who had two testicles in his belly, which were greater than any other things like mushrooms: there was no difference between them, white, small roots, and their labia were hanging down, and they were found to be moist from the very beginning

Many are expelled from the section of its blood: therefore if blood incites thee, then cauterize it.
If thou seest a feeble and timid patient from an incision with iron, then take a leaden weight and suspend it from the middle, and bind it with thread: which is the way we have said, and discharge it in two days.
Then add in stricture lead. Do not cease to bind the lead until it is separated, and it shall fall by itself without toil
If the vessel be of great size of the root, then in its incision there is something fearful and feeble: especially that which is in the belly
It is indeed possible that thou cut through its middle Then cauterize it, that it may not return
Then care for it until the wound be healed.
And be careful lest thou presume to cut the vessel which is of a dusky colour, little sense, and foetid aspect: for that is a cancer: and I will remind thee of cancer afterwards.
Chapter 52.
Of the care of the belly.
The belly swells from many wounds. Or from incisions of the intestines which are above the belly: and it comes out through the opening, or the intestine itself, according as it happens in other ruptures. Or from blood which flows from the vein, or from the artery, as has been said before Or from a distension of the belly itself.
If, however, it is due to a wound of the scrotum, and the opening of the tube: then the colour of the after-effect is similar to that of the body: and it is soft, without pain: and appears in various places. And if it is due to the emission of the intestine, then its place is as we have mentioned, with a greater degree of variety in its appearance. As you touch it with your fingers, it is hidden: then it returns, and sometimes there is a sound with it: and it swells greatly at the entrance of the bath, and great pain ensues
If indeed it is due to moisture, it is soft: then it is not hidden when you touch it with your hand, neither is there constriction, nor does it swell.
If it is due to blood, then it appears with these signs: the after-effect is black as night at the root of the penis
If indeed it is due to flesh that has died: then the after-effect is thick, great, hard, and appears according to the quantity of one
If indeed it is due to swelling, then its touch is soft.
And the operation in this is as you consider: if the prominence of the navel is due to the artery, or the vein, or swelling: then you must abstain from treatment of it. For in this there is fear and danger, as I taught you in the chapter where I spoke of the after-effect due to the artery and the vein.
If the prominence of the navel is due to the intestine, or the bladder: then you must command the patient to hold his breath, as long as he can bear it, and to remain still extending it. Then signs with the encasement around the whole circumference of the navel Then command him to recline between your hands upon his back. Then circle around with a broad spatula around the belly in the place that you have marked with a burn Then extend the middle of the incision upwards with a large hook. Then bind him firmly around with thread or silk cord: and make the knot of the ligature firm.
Then open the extended middle of the incision above the ligature If therefore you find the gut caught by the ligature: then draw out the ligature and introduce it into the finger of the index, and push the intestine inwards: and if you find a bone, then grasp it with a hook, and cut off its excess.<start-of-turn>
If, however, there is an artery or a vein: then circle it much.<start-of-turn> Then return to your work. And grasp two needles, and introduce them through two strong threads: and introduce two needles around the circumference which you made around the incision in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.<start-of-turn>
Then tighten the incision in four places over the needles: and if you will, remove the needles and leave the place, until the extended flesh putrefies: and it will fall away by itself: or cut it away when it softens and putrefies.<start-of-turn>
Then care for him with what is necessary from the unguents, until he is healed.<start-of-turn>
And if the swelling of the belly is from flesh that has become black in it, or from moisture: then it is necessary to concave the incision, as we have said.<start-of-turn And extract blood, or moisture, as you find it in it.
Then care for the place with it which solidifies the location.
Chapter 53.
And care for the cancer.
We have already spoken in the discourse concerning the species of cancer, and how it is to be treated by physicians: and caution should be taken with it when treating it with iron, lest it should ulcerate: and we have said that cancer is generated in the matrix, and should be treated with caution
And the ancients say that sometimes when cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated, such as cancer that is in the breast or in the thigh, and those that are like them, from the members that are to be excised throughout: especially when it is just beginning and small.
When it is old, and is great, it is not right to approach it closely
I am unable to cure anyone from it: neither do I know of anyone who has been able to do so before me
And the operation in it, when it is located as we have said, is to precede it, and to dissolve the disease with black bile somewhat. Then draw blood from it if you find it with a swelling evident
Then prepare the patient for the operation, in which it is placed with the operation
Then remove from the cancer nails which agree with it Then draw the wound closed from every side with skin, according to the prescription, until nothing remains of its roots: and let blood flow freely, and do not bind it up quickly, but express the place, and evacuate the thick blood throughout the hand, or as much as is possible with the instruments.
If, however, it causes blood to flow excessively from an artery or a vein: then cauterize the vein until the bleeding ceases. Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
(Sentence continues: "Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.")
Chapter 44.</start_of_turn> We shall explain in this chapter the varieties of hydropses and how water accumulates: and the signs of each kind, and their treatment by physicians.</start_of_turn>
And that which is cured with iron is not except the sole kind of ascites: and it is not approached with iron in the case of tympani: neither in the case of hydrops of the joints: for that is deadly.</start_of_turn
When you are treated for this kind of hydrops of the tympani by physicians, and the treatment does not help: then consider that.</start_of_turn For if a patient is suffering from weakness in addition to the hydrops, or if there is another illness along with the hydrops, such as consumption or solution of the intestines, and similar things: then do not treat him with iron for that is dangerous.</start_of_turn
If, however, the patient is of robust health, neither young nor old: then the mode of operation in this case is that you lift the patient up between your hands and squeeze out the urine from his belly downwards by pressing on his belly.</start_of_turn
Then take a rough sponge, according to this form.</start_of_turn Sit two acute angles, long and acute-ended like a sponge.</start_of_turn Truly, within it are things of slight size which do not pass through with it until the intestines, and which leave the wound itself.
Consider it then. For if there is a generation of hydrosis from the intestines, then it is necessary to extend [the incision] with three fingers from the navel to the lower parts in a straight line above the pelvis.
If indeed the generation of hydrosis is because of the liver: then let your incision be on the left side from the navel for three fingers
If it is because of the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side: and it is not necessary also that it should be on the side towards which the patient wishes to vomit, so that no fluid should flow to the delicate place
Then pierce with an instrument the whole skin. And introduce your hand into the incision with the sponge between the skin, and scrape, as though you are scraping the wound itself: and the quantity which you scrape should be equal to the quantity of a nail, or thereabouts.
Then scrape the sponge until the sponge reaches the empty place: and that is the place of the water Then draw out the sponge, and introduce the instrument into the hole, which has this shape. It is like a cannula: it is made of silver, or of air, or of gold, soft, thin: which has in its lower part a small hole, and in its sides three holes, two from one side and one from the other: and its extremity is cut off, in the manner of a knife wound, like blood vessels: at its upper extremity is an armilla
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends upon the instrument, and thus the water flows out of the water in an hour the quantity of a medium
If you evacuate more than is necessary from that, at a certain moment the sick man may die from the resolution of his animal spirit: or there may happen to him syncope which approaches death.
Evacuate accordingly from that according to the quantity of his virtue, and according to what is signified to you by the disposition of the sick man from the virtue of his pulse and from his health
Then draw out the instrument, and retain the water.
Because it remains immediately by the skin which retains the opening which is over the siphon: of which I spoke, that you may perforate it according to the manner I have described
Then repeat the instrument on the other side, if you find the sick man can tolerate it: and also evacuate from the water the quantity that is appropriate.
Do this several times without fear, and be cautious: until there remains from the water little or nothing.
If however you fear for the sick man, and you discharge from the water a great deal: then care for him with burial in warm sand, and with much sweating in bath and sun, and expect upon the seat: and care for him with physicians of experience, until he is healed: and cauterize upon the stomach, and the spleen and the liver, after the discharge of the water: as I have said before.
As for the care of infants who are born in places where the bladder is not perforated.
Chapter LV.</start_of_turn>
When anyone goes out of the womb of his mother, and the head of his fetus is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or is not in its proper place.</start_of_turn>
It is necessary therefore to assist with the perforation of it immediately as it is born with a fine needle, according to this fashion.</start_of_turn
Then put in the cavity the small lead claw, and bind it: and keep it for three days, or four.
When you wish to urinate, remove the claw and let it mix together Then withdraw it.
And if you do not put in lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the place will not permit the claw to stay closed
The one whose opening is strict is treated with lead, as we said, for many days, until it is enlarged
In those in which the opening is not in its proper place, they are cauterized That is, because from the part which is born, the opening is at the end of the hair of the beard: wherefore it cannot mix forward until it lifts the hair above with its hand Neither is there any generation, because the sperm cannot pass to the matrix according to its right: and it is a grievous wound that is slow
And the method of operation in this is that the patient rests on his back Then extend the hair of his beard with your left hand, and with your right hand make an incision of the head of the hair from the place of the privy, with a needle or sharp scalpel: as it is the incision of the nail, or as you would do with a radix of something, so that the middle of it comes out like the head of the hair: and that the opening be in the middle according to what is necessary
And cauterize yourself at the operation from the flow of blood. Many times this happens to them Opposition to it with that which breaks the blood, and care for the wound, until it is healed
On swelling which occurs in the preparation and head of the uterus, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
On swelling which occurs in the preparation and head of the uterus, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Many of these swellings happen in the womb, and it is the elevation of corrupted flesh.
And from these there are both malignant and non-malignant kinds
One must not make the malignant kind hang suspended with a fine thread, but must cut it off, until the whole thing is freed from the belly. Then place over it a soaked bandage in Egyptian unguent Then care for it with ointment of diaphthorb until it heals.
If the swelling is malignant, of dark colour, then one must administer in it cautery after making an incision of it and of itself.
If, however, the swelling is in the preparation and head of the uterus, not circumcised, and is a part of the swelling which is between the preparation and the uterus, and a part of it which is outside: then one must increase the swelling which is inside first, until it is consolidated, then care for the outside. For when you care for both at the same time, the preparation is not secured that it will not burst
And also in testicles, and black preparation and corruption One must therefore remove all that is decayed and that desires to corrupt, or that is already corrupted
Then place over it after this with honey which has been consumed with pounded barley and crushed herbs of thyme.
Then care for it with the remaining treatment until it heals
If blood flow increases, then apply the cautery with the lunar cautery, according to this shape.
The cautery is applied to two positions simultaneously, that is, to the blood flow and the ulcer when it is ruptured
If the head of the vein bursts and is destroyed throughout in an hour: then it is necessary to insert lead into the marrow of the bone so that the diseased part may be absorbed above the wound
In connection with the covering of the head of the vein with the caput uirgae, and this connection does not take place except in the case where the covering is sound and not required to be excised: and when it does take place through the ulcer or swelling: it is necessary to strip away the covering with blunt forceps until the ligament is severed and the head of the vein is freed from all parts.
If it is difficult to discern between these two, then it is necessary to strip away something from the head of the vein and from the covering For the covering is sometimes perforated because of its slightness or its speed.
Then separate the covering from the head of the vein with a fine linen cloth which has been made wet in cold water, so that they do not adhere to each other again.
Then care for it with balsamic vinegar until it has solidified
Chapter 57.
Concerning the treatment of infants, and the care for an error from an accident.
Circumcision is not a continuous solution like other wounds: indeed when it is carried out by our operation, with our will, and when it is in children of their own kind, it is necessary to show in this operation a greater skill and to remove as little as possible of the surrounding area.
I say, therefore, that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: for they did not use it in their practices, and there is nothing except that which we have learned through experience.
Indeed, for I have found a greater part of surgeons to be engaged in artificial methods, such as phlebotomy and cautery, using the knife with a nail and with scissors: and they employ them for all sorts of affections, and bind with thread and suture with a needle.
I have also tried all these methods, and I have not found a better method of healing than the use of scissors and thread binding.
For in the use of the knife with a nail, a great quantity of skin flees. For the skin of the prepuce has two layers: therefore it is possible that the upper skin may split, and the lower layer will be threatened: it is therefore necessary to make an incision to split the other, and to avoid the future pain And when the healing is done by means of the cautery, which is what the physicians use, the incision of the extremity of the limb is not secured: for perhaps it enters the opening of the canal.
But in the use of the needle with a hook, perhaps the iron will go through, and will corrupt your work: and the skin of a boy is of little strength, and many are produced in this way, which does not befit healing: I therefore reject this method
Healing by means of the knife and thread, however, has proved a good experiment to me: for the knives are proportional to the incision: therefore, as the former is greater, so also is the latter. When you have therefore grasped your hand, the two acutenesses are proportional, and they cut according to the operation of one at the same time: and it makes a similar compression of the figure, containing the skin of the member from all sides, so that no error is made at all
And the manner of performing the operation is thus, that you make the child understand, especially if there is one who understands fully, that you do not do this unless you bind the thread in its place: and you dismiss him until another day.
Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way that he can, from which he receives his intelligence. Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and do not sit down: and hide the shears in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the child sees nothing of them, neither anything of the instruments.
Then insert your hand into the wound, and blow into the skin, and draw it up, until the head of the wound comes out. Then bind up the rest that is gathered in that cavity.
Then bind the place marked with a double thread. Then bind below it with the same thread as before Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower binding securely, and cut between the two bindings. Then lift the skin up quickly and remove the head of the wound Then let the blood run slowly (for it is better thus) and put powder on it: and put a bandage over the powder on which the swollen part has been immersed in rose-water, pounded with fresh rose-water: and dismiss him until the next day: and care for the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
The form of the shears for this dressing is like this
There are two handles and two blades, and the handles should not extend into the wound: and the length of the two blades should be equal to the length of two thumbs together
An error often occurs in excision: because perhaps the entire intrinsic skin has escaped beyond the incision.
Therefore it is necessary to extend the time from your hour until your nail has passed beyond the margin of the wound: and then make the incision according to the degree of equality
If you are unable to hold the wound steady with your nail, then extract it with forceps and make the incision.
If, however, three days have passed and what remains under the swelling has become soft, remove the dressing: then let the swelling subside, and cleanse it gently, and make the incision as before: and take care to avoid the head of the swelling. It will not cause any damage to it.
Treat it with the care that consolidates the wound from its fragments, as we have narrated in the treatise on fragments: and if it happens that it breaks through the skin beyond the measure, and reaches the upper parts, it does not cause any damage to it even then
Treat it with the care we have mentioned, until it is healed
Chapter 58.
Of the extraction of a retained vein in a swelling
The retention of urine in the swelling is caused by a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh born, or similar things of that kind that we have mentioned in the section on treatment of diuresis.
If the urine does not pass, and the retention is known to be caused by a stone which is in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary for him to lie with his knee bent over his heel Then they should place his feet on his back, and extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and grasp the painful area as tightly as possible for him It is thought therefore that when the collar of the bladder approaches the expulsion of the stone to the back: the bladder is obstructed.
If it is not solved with this, and the disease be great: then it is necessary that you perform the extraction of it with an instrument, which is called a siringa. It is formed of silver, is subtle, soft, and concave like a pennaceous quill in the smoothness of a ray, long like the palm of one hand and a half: which has a fine cannula in its head.
The way to evacuate the bladder is through itself: take two threads and tie them at their extremities with good ligature. Insert the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the siringa: and pierce with forceps if anything comes out through the wool. But insert into the cannula with certainty, as if lifting.
Then pour oil, butter, and vinegar on the siringa: and make the patient sit over a seat, and support the bladder, and draw out the urine with oil, butter, and warm water.
Then insert the siringa into the urine until it reaches the root of the bladder.
Then take hold of the upper part above the navel
Then push the siringa into itself until it reaches the bladder, and let the patient feel that it has gone to the painful area: and do not do this except when the meatus through which it passes is tortuous
Then draw out the thread gradually with the wool The bladder will follow the wool.
Then draw out the urine, and make the bladder flow through the opening of the urine: and repeat the siringa, and do not cease doing this until the bladder is emptied, and the patient feels relief.
Concerning the quality of the bladder's irrigation with Clepshydra.
Regarding the quality of the irrigation of the bladder with Clepshydra.
When there is a wound in the bladder, or when blood is frozen in it, or congealed in it into pus, and when it is distilled into water and medicines: then it is done with an instrument called Clepshydra, and this is its form
It is blunt, that is, closed. And there are three holes in it, two from one side and one from the other side, like urine
And the spigot hole, where that which drives it is located, should be according to the quantity that is desired to be driven without addition, until when it is pulled with it something is taken up from the humilities: and when it is driven, when it is expelled at length: according to what the Clepshydra does which ejects oil, that is, Greek fire in battle.
When it is desired to spray moisture into the bladder, introduce the extremity of the Clepshydra into the moisture and draw it with that which drives it up, the moisture is then drawn into the concavity of the Clepshydra.
Then introduce its extremity into the urine, as we said in the syringe Then drive the moisture with that which drives it and immediately the moisture arrives in the bladder, as the sick person feels
The form of the light bladder irrigation.
It is made of silver, or gold: whose head is higher like a small bowl, and under it there is a space between which the ligament falls.
Then take hold of the bladder of a sheep, and put in it the moisture which is to irrigate the bladder Then bind the two sinuses firmly with a double thread: and heat the humidity above the fire.
Then introduce the extremity of the clister into the abscess, afterwards tighten your hand over the vessel with a tight closure of humidity until the patient feels that the humidity has passed into the vessel.
If however the vessel is not present, then take hold of the piece of gut and make a circle of it, and pierce it through from all its roundness Then introduce the thread strongly through these holes, so that they resemble a twist Then gather the circle, so that it is like gathering wool: after you have placed in it what you wish of humilities, and oils, and waters.
Then bind it in the instrument: and do it like that which you did with the vessel when expressing with your hand, until the humidity has passed into the vessel.
Chapter LX.
¶ On the extraction of the Lapis.
We have already spoken in the treatise on the species of the Lapis, and its treatment with physicians: and we have spoken of the difference between the Lapis generated in the bowels and the uesica, and the signs of the latter: and we have spoken of the Lapis in which the operation is performed with the hand and the section: and the Lapis which is generated in the uesica itself: and that which appears in the abscess. And I shall speak of this with manifest exposition and abbreviation.
I say therefore, that the Lapis which is generated in the uesica, most often happens to children
And from its signs it is known that the urine comes out of the uesica like water in its substance: and there appears in it white sand, and the patient feels his wound swelling and throbbing, and he groans with it, and is often fainting Then it is erected, and goes out with the anus in many people.
Healing is easy for children from this point on until they are fourteen years old. It is difficult in old age. But in youth it is middle-aged; for that which is between these two is of medium kind: and that which is greater in age, the cure is easier: and if it is slight, the care is less expensive
When we come to the cure, it is necessary in the first place to purge the patient with a cathartic, which will evacuate all the stool which is in the intestines: for this indeed often hinders the finding of the stone during inquiry
Then the patient is taken with his feet, and is beaten, and moved downwards: so that the stone may go down to the bottom of the bladder, or may come out from a high place somewhat.
Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and your hands be under his buttocks, so that the bladder may be entirely inclined downwards
Then inquire of him, and touch him externally.
If you feel the stone in the space, then immediately perform a section above it
If it does not come under your touch at all, then you must remove the index finger of your left hand if the patient is a child: or the middle finger if he is an adult male: and insert it into his rectum, and inquire of the stone, until it is under your finger: and bring it slowly to the neck of the bladder.
Then press above it with your finger, and push it outwards towards the place where the incision is to be made: and command the minister to grasp the bladder with his hand, and command another minister to extend the testicles of his hand to the upper part: and another hand to move the skin which is under the testicles in the part where the incision is to be made.
Then introduce the sponge into the wound, which has this shape. Then introduce the sponge into the wound, which has this shape. Find in it what is between the womb and the testicles, and not in the middle, at the side of the left hip: and let the incision be above the highest stone, and your finger be in the rectum: and make a transverse incision, so that the external incision is wide and the internal incision is narrow, according to the quantity that it is possible for the stone to issue from it not greater.
Perhaps the finger that is in the rectum will be compressed by the stone at the incision, and will issue without difficulty.
And you know that the stone has angles and margins, because of which its exit is difficult
And from this [stone] is soft, like a gland, and round: and its exit is easy
Therefore, to the stone which has angles and margins, add in the fissure
If it does not issue thus, then you must know that you must place something above it: or that you must grasp it with a forceps with a handle like the moon, which grasps the stone and does not slip from it: or that you must introduce an instrument under it, curved at its extremities.
If you cannot do this, then enlarge the opening nearby. If anything else flows out from the blood, cut it off with a saw
If there is more than one stone, then push out the big one first to the bone of the hip Then cut over it Then push out the small ones afterwards: and do the same if there are more than two.
If the wound is great, then ignorance is equal to the section above it. For if a sick man is seized by two things, either he will die, or he will suffer a persistent discharge of urine: because the place is not consolidated anywhere.
But give him an enema to expel it, until it comes out: or take hold of the fracture of it with forceps, until you have driven it out frustrated.
When you have finished your operation, then put on a coverlet, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it up, and put upon it a soft dressing of oil and wine, or rose water and cold water: so that the swelling may subside
Then rest the sick man on his side, and do not relax the ligaments, until the third day. When you have relaxed it, stitch up the place with much water, and oil.
Then care for it with rue balm, and alum, until it heals.
If indeed in the wound there is added a soft swelling, and corruption, and such like: as if blood is congealed in the bladder, and is withheld from it: and this is known from the discharge of blood with urine. Insert your finger into the wound, and draw out the clot of blood. For if it remains, it causes corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and apply all kinds of things which are useful for the cure, until it heals
And it is necessary in the course of the cure of all these things, that you bind up two thighs, and bind together, the cause of the physicians who put things upon the place.
If the stone is small and lies in the bladder, and it projects into it, and prevents the discharge of urine: then care for it with that which I have mentioned before until you reach the section. You must not evacuate from the section for this treatment, for I have proved it to be effective.</start_of_turn>
And it is that you take a perforator of iron, which is triangular at the extremities, acute, and fixed in wood.</start_of_turn>
Then take a thread, and tie it with it under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.</start_of_turn
Then insert the perforator into the bladder with ease, until it reaches the stone: and withdraw the perforator gradually from the stone: and make the perforation through it from the other side.</start_of_turn
The urine will immediately cease.</start_of_turn>
Then press your hand over that which remains from the stone from the exterior part of the bladder.</start_of_turn It will itself break, and go out with the urine, and the infirm will be healed.</start_of_turn>
If however this treatment is not prepared for him, because of something that hinders it: then tie a thread under the stone, and a thread above the stone.</start_of_turn Then dry over the stone in the very urine between two ligatures.</start_of_turn Then extract it.</start_of_turn> Then dissolve the ligament, and bind the frozen blood, which is in the wound.</start_of_turn>
And it is not necessary to tie a thread under the stone, except that it does not return to the bladder: and to tie one above, except when the thread is dissolved after the evacuation of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and closes the wound: and for this reason it is necessary for you to tie that above when you have ligated the thread below, so that you elevate the skin to the upper parts, so that the skin returns to its proper place and closes the wound, as we have said.</start_of_turn>
On the extraction of the stone from women.
On the extraction of the stone from women.
Stones are rarely generated in women.
If, however, it should happen to any of them that a stone should occur, then its treatment is difficult, and is prohibited by many methods
One of them is: perhaps the woman is pregnant.
And the second is, because you will not find a woman who will confess to a physician that she has a stone when she is chaste, or out of fear of her husband
The third is, because you will not find a woman who is well-informed concerning this art, especially the operation with the hand
And the fourth is the distance of the stone from the place of its origin: because it demands a deep section, and there is fear in that
If necessity compels you to do that, then you must take a woman physician, who is well-informed: and few are found
If you do wish to do this beforehand, then seek out a wise physician, discreet, and present to her a skilled woman in matters concerning women, or a woman who has been trained in this art to a certain extent: make her do everything that you have learned from your inquiry concerning the stone
Firstly, that she may see if the woman is pregnant: then she must insert her finger into her belly and search for the stone
If she finds it, she should grasp it under her finger and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the lower belly, and inquire about the stone after she has placed her left hand over the waist and has pressed it firmly
If there is a stone in the bladder, it is necessary that he gradually move it from the orifice of the bladder to the lower parts with all his power, until it reaches the root of the hip bone.
Then he should secrete above it toward the middle of the vulva toward the root of the hip bone from whichever side it is prepared for him, and he feels the stone in that part: and his finger does not move from the stone, coiling under it: and let there be a small incision at first Then he introduces the radium through that incision.
Then he introduces the radium through that incision. If he feels the stone, then he adds to the incision according to the quantity that the stone comes out from it.
And you know that there are many kinds of stones. Among them is the small one, and the large one, the soft one and the rough one, the long one and the round one having a branch.
You know therefore the kind of these, so that you may recognize them by this sign above that
If there is blood, then add in the place of the wound a compress that has been soaked for an hour, until the blood is stopped.
Then return to your operation, until the stone comes out: and make ready with the instruments that I mentioned in the extraction of the stone from the bladder, so that you may help with these in your operation.
If there is a flow of blood, and you know that the evacuation of blood is from the artery that was cut: then put powder on the place, and bind it with fine threads: and do not move it: and let go of the stone, and do not pull it out Perhaps the woman will die. Then care for the wound.
When blood flow subsides after a day and the place putrefies, return to your operation until the bone has healed.
Chapter XII.
In the event of a supernumerary hernia with fluid.
A swelling filled with fluid is not a hernia, except for the gathering of moisture under the white membrane covering the testicles which is called a hernia
When it is inside the scrotum itself, which the nature has prepared for it in part or all, until it bursts: which is the testicles themselves, and is the white membrane surrounding the testicles which we mentioned before. And this does not happen except rarely
The origin of this swelling is from the weakness which occurs in the testicles: from which this material flows out And sometimes from a blow to the testicles
And this moisture has many colors Or it is of a yellow-orange color, or it is a reddish-brown, or greenish-brown, or black, or white like water, and the like is more
The signs indicating the presence of such an accumulation of fluid are these For if there is fluid in the white membrane which we mentioned before, then the swelling is round like the figure of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from all sides
And if there is moisture in the scrotum itself, then the swelling is round with a part of the testicles exposed, and for this reason the man knows that there is another testicle
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane, then it falls under the sense.
When therefore one desires cognition of the colour of moisture, then to experience the colour of moisture in the apostemate with an introduced square, whose form precedes. According to that, therefore as it proceeds in the cavity of the introduced square, judge concerning that which is between them
When therefore we come to the treatment with the iron, then it is necessary to apply pressure to the patient, so that a bloodletting may be performed if possible, and to fill the body with liquid.
Then it is rested upon its back upon a high thing, and under it are placed many cushions
Then sit on its left side, and command the attendant, so that he may sit on its right side, who extends the arm of its left side to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part near the navel
Then take a broad spatula, and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle along its length, until almost to the navel: and make a cut according to the rule of an equidistant line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white membrane which encompasses it: and scrape it off and observe, or cut through from this, so that you may dissect it: and let your scraping be as great as that which you can manage.
Then pierce the full bladder with a wide perforation, and drain out all the water.
Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the bladder upwards, and do not touch the membrane encompassing the testicles: and cut the bladder in whatever way seems possible to you, or with its entirety, or in pieces, especially its wide side superficially For if you do not carefully examine it, in its incision there will be no security, as the water will return.
If, however, anything external proceeds from its socket in the hour of your operation: then when you have completed the section of the gut, reduce it. Then gather up two lips of the skin of the testicles with sutures.
Then care for it like the rest of the wounds, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>

And if you make it even, as for a single operation, then do so: then drain the blood.</start_of_turn And introduce into the sections a soaked lamb's wool in fat, or in rose oil: and put outside the wool another lamb's wool which you have submerged in wine and fat, and expand between the two testicles, and see the belly: and put above them doubled cloths, and are nails: and bind them up above with a ligament, which is having six like this shape.</start_of_turn
And take away two cloths, and wash, and apply the saffron cloth, according to this likeness: and let the extremities which are carried out from the socket, or wet wool: and gather them with the tightening in the lumbar region of the flanks: and one extremity shall take over upon a buttock until the back, and the second shall take over at the part of the groin: and two extremities upon two lower thighs, and two extremities else upon two buttocks, and gather the whole tightening in the lumbar region of the flanks.</start_of_turn
And when it is necessary to treat these swellings artificially with the cautery in the place of incision with the iron: take the cautery with a fine handle and cauterise the skin of the testicles. When the fat surrounding the testicle has been consumed as much as it can be: then take the cautery once more, this time in the manner we have described.

Take care not to touch the tissue with the flame.
You know that this operation is safer and more reliable than incision, and brings about a better result
If, however, you should find resistance to the operation at the time of incision, or afterwards when the cautery is applied, or there is bleeding or some other complication: then you must cure the cause of the complication in the way which is appropriate to it, as has been explained before
If, however, the patient is timid and does not expect to survive this operation because of its horror: then administer perforation as I have described above: and this is sufficient
When you have confirmed that the swelling is aqueous as we have said: then you must make the patient sit up on an elevated seat
Then perforate the abscess in its lower part with a wide spatula: and make the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until water flows out completely.
Then place a compress above the place, and bind it tightly, and let it drain out the remaining water: then care for it until the wound is healed.</start_of_turn>
If however resistance to the outflow of water exists in the hour when you perforate it: and this does not happen except for the white plug that opposes the exit of water through the wound, and hinders its outflow: then it is necessary that you introduce a needle into the wound, or an instrument with which the watery humour is extracted, whose form has gone before: or that you add in the operation of the wound a little of the aforementioned.</start_of_turn>
And you know that the water returns and accumulates after six months, or thereabouts.</start_of_turn> When it accumulates again, then it must return in the same way, and pass over the unhealthy days of its life.</start_of_turn>

And I recall the operation in this very matter, and the kind of abscess.</start_of_turn
I say, that many abscesses happen in bodies, from which testicles are composed: and this happens from a wound of many kinds, namely.</start_of_turn
Whether from acute swelling or from acridness, which flows down to the testicles. Or from impact.
And it is pale according to the colour of the body, and is not painful: and is a grave swelling.
And perhaps it is a stone swelling, whose colour is dark, and there is no sensation in it
And sometimes it is from the swelling of arteries, and the swelling of the veins: thus is its memory recalled: or from the swelling of the veins
Which, therefore, is from the swelling of the arteries, is known by the arrangement of the swelling, when you press it with your fingers And it is not necessary that you touch it immediately.
That which is from the swelling of the veins, does not disperse from this by pressing with the fingers
And it is possible that above this kind of swelling there should be an incision, and above the rest of the flesh: and it is like cutting the skin of the testicles. Then spread out the palm of your hand upwards, and pull out the swelling with white silk: and liberate the swelling from the tissues, and ligate the vessel: and cut through the swelling after you have freed it from all parts of it.
If indeed the swelling is consolidated with those natural parts of the body, then it is necessary to grasp the swelling and cut it through
And if there is adhesion between something of the substance of the veins, or in that which is between the vessels: then it is necessary to free the whole adhesion, and to make a round incision
And if there is a natural protrusion of the flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary to cut through all of that, and pull out the swelling, as we have said
When the operation is finished, take a walnut and infuse it into the lancet that is filled with fat, and mix it with wine. Then care for the patient with the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
The head of the book is LXIIII
Take care of the incision, which is with the vite.
A swelling is a swelling that has infiltrated the quadam, similar to a bag of beans, with softening of the testicles: and it makes it difficult for the infirm to move and exercise, and to walk
And in the treatment of this swelling is fear, because of which there is recollection.
It is true that we must say that the operation in this case must be as the first ones did
I say therefore, that you must make the infirm sit on a raised seat Then push the swelling of the testicles downwards Then hold the testicles with your fingers, with the nails towards the veins: and hold them with another person, and extend them with an extension of the hands
Then make an incision with a sharp knife with a transverse section in the direct line of the veins, until the veins are detected
Then scrape away from all parts, as we said to you in the extraction of the arteries when they are in their time
Then fix in place a sponge in which there is a double thread, and bind it in the first place where the veins are found: and bind it again at the end of them Then dry it in the middle section straight according to the length of the body, and extract what is gathered from the humours of rotten faeces.
Then care for the one with the ailment along with the care of the remaining ailments, in which is the desire to generate health, so that the masses that feed one testicle fall away. There is no evil in that.
If, however, the masses fall upon all the masses, then it is necessary to remove the testicles along with the masses: so that they do not be denied nourishment by incision, and that they be destroyed, or that they be damaged, and not be in agreement with them
Chapter 65.</start_of_turn>
Of the care of the intestines.
The event of this ailment is from the section which occurs in the large intestine above the belly in the groin from the wonder of the belly.
Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle? And this rupture is either from the siph or from the extension of it
And these two kinds of ailments occur from many wounds: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or an elevation of a heavy thing, and the like
And the sign when it is from the extension of the siph. It is that which gradually happens in a long time, and does not happen immediately: and is equal swelling all around: because the siph compresses the intestine
And the sign of it when it is from the section of the siph, because it makes the pain that immediately arises from the beginning: and is diverse swelling, appearing under the skin nearby: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the outside of the siph
And when it comes out with the intestine raw: and this is called intestinal rupture, and bursting: and when it is with vomiting.
When the stool runs into the intestine and remains there, it brings about the suffering of the patient. For it makes the pain of the buttocks grow worse, especially when it is expelled.
In the treatment of this disease there is fear of the iron: therefore it is necessary to avoid this situation.</start_of_turn>
The method of operation is to expel the main part of the patient's intestine into the concave part of the belly.</start_of_turn> Then it is placed over the hump of the belly between the hands and the flanks are elevated.</start_of_turn
Then the skin following the skin to the upper part is stretched out, and the skin of the testicles is completely dried along its length.</start_of_turn Then two stitches are made at the two corners of the wound, according to what is necessary to open the part with the least amount of damage: and the cutting should be as little as possible, so that it may be expelled from it easily.</start_of_turn
Then the fat and what is under the skin of the testicles is excoriated until the white fat is detected, hard from all parts: then insert your finger into that which follows the testicle, in that which is between the white fat which is under the skin and the fat which is below, and alongside that which is in the back part of the testicle.</start_of_turn
Then move with the right hand the fat inwards towards the skin of the testicles: and with this stretch the white fat upwards, with the left hand: and elevate the testicles with the fat until the part which was cut is reached: and order the minister to stretch the testicles upwards: and you will have solved the adhesion which is at the complete solution.</start_of_turn
And look with your fingers, that there is nothing left in the white fat or hard fat.</start_of_turn If, however, you find something from there: then drive it downwards into the lower belly.

In the cavity of the rectum, no one has ever dared to perform an operation with an iron.
Indeed, the first ones said that it is like what we have told you about the rectum which is with the veins. That is, as the veins are ligated below the section above, and dried in the middle, and the operation is completed by opening it up to the end, until the veins have fallen away: and the cautery is applied, as we have already said, until the wound has healed.
Chapter LXVII.
Concerning the disruption which takes place in the groin.
When a rupture takes place in the groin, as we have already said, and the place protrudes, and does not descend to the testicles anything from the intestines: and if it descends, it is a little and returns in every hour: however if it is prolonged with this time, an opening is added in the groin, until the intestines descend into the groin
And this happens from the extension of the groin, which is in the groin as we have already said That is, because the groin is stretched: then it is softened, and the place is protruded, and the bulge emerges
And its treatment is with cautery, as we have already said.
And when it is treated with an iron, in this way: and the patient lies down on his back between your hands. Then dry the place of the rupture after it has protruded and emerged, by cutting across the width, according to the quantity of three fingers wide
Then ligate the veins which are under the skin, until the groin is white, which is under the skin following it.
Then grasp the radium and place it over the prominent place from the sac, and press it down into the depth of the belly.
Then two prominent places will be seen on the extremity of the radium from the sac, and join them with a suture one with the other: then draw out the extremity of the radium.</start_of_turn>
And do not cut through the sac entirely, neither tear any membrane, neither anything else, as I have told you in the treatment of intestinal branches.</start_of_turn>
Then take care of the wound.</start_of_turn When you have cut the suture, bind it up and restore the wound, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Do not make the wound tense, and do not add prominence to the rupture.</start_of_turn
And the cautery is better in this place: because it is closer to the vein.</start_of_turn>

¶ Regarding the softening of the skin of the testicles.</start_of_turn
The skin of the testicles is softened in many people, because the flesh which is between them is softened, and its aspect is improved.</start_of_turn
Therefore it is necessary for him who is being treated for this to make the patient lie down on his back, and to cut away the softened skin over the natural skin.</start_of_turn
Then gather together two lips with a suture: and if you wish, remove the excess of softened skin by three or four sutures, and fix the suture.</start_of_turn
Then cut between the sutures.</start_of_turn

You know that castration is forbidden in our law: and for that reason I will not mention it in this book: and it is not necessary to mention it, except for two cases.
Except that in the science of medicine, when it is asked about it, and to know its cure when it happens to someone
And the other case is that we often do not need castration of some animals, because of our love for them, such as horses, gazelles, and goats, and similar animals.
I say therefore, that castration is done in two ways. Or by attrition Or by incision and section
In the former method, the operation is to make the animal sit in warm water, until the testicles soften and become limp, and hang down: then grasp the testicles with your hand and pull them out until they are resolved and no longer appear under the touch
But in castration by incision and section, it is necessary to hold the animal firmly, and grasp the skin of the testicles with your left hand.
Then ligate the suspension, and dry over the whole of the incision a single time, until two holes appear: then cut through them after you have scraped away the surrounding tissue. Do not let anything except for the fine blood clot remain on them
And this method of castration is better than that by attrition: because attrition sometimes leaves something behind in the testicles which the animal dislikes during coitus
Then care for the wound until it heals.

Then care for the wound until it heals. For a hermaphrodite is like two wounds. Then care for the wound until it heals. For a hermaphrodite is like two wounds because it appears in the place where the space is between the scrotum and the testicles, where there is a figure like a female vulva, which has hair, and from which urine sometimes runs out from the scrotum.
Then care for the wound until it heals. For a hermaphrodite is like two wounds because it appears in the place where the space is between the scrotum and the testicles, where there is a figure like a female vulva, which has hair, and from which urine sometimes runs out from the scrotum. In women, however, there is one kind, which is like a female vulva placed over the testicles like small testicles altogether, protruding outwards: of which one is like the penis of a man, and two are like two testicles
And the care of three kinds, two of which are from the males, and one from the females, is this: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh until the impression of these has fled. Then care for the wound until it heals.
Then care for the wound until it heals. But as for the second kind of wound from which urine comes out, which is in the scrotum, there is no operation, nor any care for it
Then care for the wound until it heals
Then care for the wound until it heals.
A tentule perhaps is added over the natural thing, until it is eaten away and its aspect is spoiled: and when it is grown in some women so much, until it expands like in the males, and persists until coitus.
It is necessary therefore that you tighten the superflous Tentiginis with one finger, or with two, and cut: and do not stop cutting until you have reached the root, especially in deep incisions, lest there should occur a flow of blood.
Then care for the wound itself until it has healed.
The carbuncle is a wound which is born in the orifice of the matrix, until it has filled itself up: and perhaps it goes out to the exterior according to the fashion of a tail: and because of this some call it a carbuncle of the tail It is necessary therefore that we cut like we cut the Tentiginis, and care for the wound, until it has healed
As for the care of the wound of a woman which is not pierced.
Chapter 72.
The alratica is like a wound of a woman which is not pierced, or like a small hole. It is either natural or accidental
The accidental one is from a wound which preceded it: and this is either born from flesh added to it, or from fine pus, or from a spiss, and it is either in the deep of the matrix, or in its flanks, or in the upper part of it, or in the lower part of it: and it hinders coition and conception, and delivery, and perhaps hinders menstruation.
And the knowledge of this is by the aspect of the obstetrician, if there is an apparent prolapse nearby
If not, then inquire with your fingers, or with an X-ray
If however the prolapse is from fine pus, and is close to two teeth: then restrain it, and break it
And it is, that you put over two lips the little cushions.
Then put your fingers of both hands together, and the woman should sit with her back against her thighs spread wide open. Then stretch out the two lips with force, until the soft tissue is broken and the hair is opened up.
Then take the sponge, and soak it in oil, and put it on the place: and the woman should keep it moist every day, so that it does not harden in another place
If, however, the soft tissue is thick and tough: then it is necessary that you cut it out with a blunt knife like the edge of a myrtle leaf.
If, however, the hair has sprung from the flesh: then suspend the oil with the nails, and cut it: and be with physicians who can stop the flow of blood without causing a wound, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus aggregated with alum or white of egg.
Then give a wide lead pencil made of lead, so that it does not adhere to the wound too quickly, keep it for a few days: and give a decoction of dry rue, then care for the rest of the cure, until it is healed
And when the birth of other flesh occurs in the womb: it is necessary therefore that they be cut according to this method: while there is no cancerous tumor that is in the womb, do not make opposition to iron in any way whatsoever
(The remaining text is not included in the request.)
With regard to the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor of the red in women's buttocks
Hemorrhoids are indeed a bursting of the veins, because there is much blood flowing from them.
When many are affected with hemorrhoids, they become little ones: and I have already spoken of the kinds of these and their signs: and I will now tell you what they receive for treatment and what they do not.
I say then, that those hemorrhoids which are in the rectum and are not visible to the sense: then there is no treatment for them with iron
Those, however, which are in the rectum above which the sense falls, are those which are cured.
It is necessary therefore that you put the woman in a cold house. Then extend the little ones with forceps, or with rough cloth, and cut away their roots.
Then powder over the wounds with some of the powder from one incision without causing any damage: like acacia, and the blood of a dragon, and thus, and similar things.
Then compel her feet to the wall for one hour. Then put her in cold water afterwards
If the bleeding persists: then make her sit in a decoction of rue, and nutmeg seeds, and barley, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it over her back
If blood is thereby detached with it, that is good: and if not, make them adhere to the swelling, and blisters, without scarification
Then take wool, and soak it in pitch juice, or in pomegranate juice, or in the juice of elderberry leaves, that is, aglanter, pontico wine, and make them adhere to the wound.
When the limb is quiet after the incision, then care for the place with unguents until it heals.
When the limb is quiet after the incision, then care for the place with unguents until it heals.
It is necessary therefore that you cut away what appears from it, as I have said before, and care for the place, until it heals.
Chapter LXXIV.
Regarding the perforation of the uterus which occurs in the matrix.
There are many kinds of abscesses which occur in the matrix, such as cancer, and stone abscess, and ulcer, and tumours, and carbuncles, and herpes, and haemorrhoids, and fistula, and thelia, and abscesses which are cold to the touch
And I will say concerning all these ailments and their kinds, their signs and their treatments in general: it is necessary to speak of the cold abscess which occurs in the matrix, when it is from abscesses which join health, and how it is opened with a knife
It is necessary therefore to consider it When the pain of the abscess is acute at its beginning, with percussion, flame and fever: and you see it turn red: if it falls outside of its sense, do not attempt to perforate it: care for it with something which will promote its maturation, until the acute pain has subsided
When it is necessary to make her sit on a chair which supports two chairs, and to recline, or to place her on her back, and to bring her feet down to the lower part of the belly: and let her hips be spread out, and put her arms under her armpits, and bind both her ligaments conveniently to that
Then let the obstetrix sit at the right side and handle the instrument which opens the opening of the uterus.
And it is necessary when you are about to handle this instrument, so that the liver rests upon the Radio of the deep matrix of the woman: so that there is not that which enters through the instrument more than that which is deep in the matrix, and that harms the lower part.
But if the instrument is thicker than the depth, then it is necessary to put sponges upon the covering of the deep matrix: in order that the entrance of the whole instrument into the depth of the matrix be obstructed: and it is necessary to put a sponge, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and to hold the instrument, and to rotate the minister of the sponge, until the depth of the matrix is opened
When therefore the Exitura appears, and it is grasped by the hand, and is soft and gentle: then it is necessary to cut it off at its head with a broad spatula.</start_of_turn>
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary to put into the wound a piece of lint submerged in saffron oil: or in olive oil, in which there is some astringency: and put on the lint, and draw out the section from the depth of the matrix.</start_of_turn>
And put externally upon the matrix, and upon the abdomen wool soaked in water, in which are bad blood clots.</start_of_turn>
Then care after two days with an unguent that agrees with it, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And when the matrix and the wound are washed, it is to be plastered with water and honey: then with water in which is the radix of lily, or long aristolochia: then return to the unguent.</start_of_turn
If a vein is hidden deep within the matrix, it is necessary to prohibit treatment with iron, and indeed to treat it with that which we mentioned in the discourse.

How a doctor should treat fetuses which emerge in an unnatural form from their mothers' wombs.
An Obstetrician must first recognise the natural form of childbirth.</start_of_turn>
When a woman is in labour and she desires to smell the air and moves her head above what is above her, and makes haste to bring forth the child: then you know that this birth is of a natural form, and that the head comes forth first, and the second after.</start_of_turn
When you see these signs, then it is necessary to grasp the uterus, so that the fetus may descend more quickly.</start_of_turn
For when the head comes down, the second part also comes down with it, and they go out with these excessive movements in a good delivery.</start_of_turn
Whoever is outside of this delivery is unnatural and harmful.</start_of_turn
For when the fetus comes out on his feet, and his body comes out before his head, and his feet and hands together, or one of his feet: or his head and hand together: or his belly comes out: and perhaps he turns over his neck, and is similar to those figures which are harmful.</start_of_turn
It is necessary for the Obstetrician to be prudent and cautious in all these matters, and to avoid error and miscarriage: and I show you all the figures and the wit which is in them, and I signify it by this, and I stand over it.</start_of_turn
When the fetus emerges from its head during its natural delivery and grasps the woman, and its delivery becomes difficult for her, and the man's power is slackened: then let the man sit down, or the women hold the man: and let them vaporize the woman's breath with fumigation of incense and with oily unguents.
Then the obstetrician inserts his fingers between the fetus's toes and finds the navel, and cuts it with his nail, until it runs clear of the moisture: and he presses the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends
If it does not descend, then it is necessary to cause the woman to strain with a suppository of incense, with poppy seeds.
Then command her to strain after the suppository: and let her clench her abdomen with concentration, and grasp her teeth and nose for an hour. The fetus will immediately emerge.
If two hands of the fetus emerge at the first, it is necessary to reduce them gradually with ease If it does not obey in delivery, then let the woman sit down, and lift her feet above her head: then sit down on the earth: and the woman shall be held, that she may not fall from the shock
If, however, the hands do not emerge, and the fetus dies: then cut off the hands, and extract the fetus: and bind the hand with cloth, and extract it with evenness: for it will emerge by itself
The exit of the fetus from its feet When the fetus emerges from its feet, then it is necessary to push it upwards: then gradually turn the fetus: afterwards straighten it out.
Then he shall grasp one foot of it and extend it gradually.
When they are gone up to the hips, then command him to bend, so that he may be compressed, and make him draw in: they will go out again, if God wills it.
And if they do not go out with that, then gradually reduce the foot, until you have set it according to the natural form For it will go out of itself when its time comes.
If it is opposed by all this, then take hold of the upper part of the wound with the thumb and index finger, and with the other hand take a sponge dipped in oil and gum Arabic: and strike all over the wound with a good blow: then lay over it the palm of the woman's hand, and the lower part of her belly. Then make him sit in warm water, until the hypocondria follows
When the lower parts are relaxed by the warmth, then make him drink a mixture of myrrh: and put him to bed. When an hour has passed, then make him sit on a seat. Then make him draw in: and bind his jaw and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with ease For the foot will go out immediately.
The foot comes out over the knee and hand. When it comes out in this form, then put your hand in slowly Then the woman lies down on his neck, and hangs his feet down: and she herself lies down on the bed, and puts her hands together Then first above the belly of it slowly. Then withdraw that which is under its feet from the heel, until it is prepared in the lower part. If the fetus does not come out, then grasp its feet and move them by movement of the hand Then first above the navel slowly, until the fetus ascends to the upper part Then insert your hand inside, and stabilize the fetus slowly: and command the woman to compress, until the fetus comes out.
The fetus comes out lying sideways from the hands It is finished with the reduction of its hand If however it is not possible to reduce it, then elevate the woman, and make her walk
If she is indeed unable to walk, then make her lie down on the bed: and strike her thighs with the hand of the other hand
Then administer the unguents which you prepared from the mucilage.
If she bears a part, then make her sit on a seat Then stay in the reduction of the hand, and stabilize the fetus according to the natural figure: and command the woman to compress, and tell her to breathe, until it comes out
The fetus comes out over its collar, with its hands spread out, and its face is towards the back of the mother The midwife must hold the foot of the fetus, then slowly turn it around, and stabilize it with ease
When it is thus stabilized, then place over its vulva what we have mentioned of the wax and mucilage
Then command him to move slowly. When you have done that, then make him sit down on a chair, and command him to lean to his right side. Then command him to breathe: and make him clench his abdomen with his hand
The fetus is prepared on the right side When it has descended to the birth opening in this way with the second hand, then cut the second one with your nail until it is evacuated from the moisture.
If it is suspended on the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it does not remain and die
Then push the fetus inwards, until you place your hand according to what is necessary: and command the woman to compress herself slightly: I myself will come out through the easy way.
The birth of twins, or many fetuses. You know that twins are often born: and sometimes three or four are born. This is extraordinary, and rarely happens.
Five or more is a thing beyond nature, and does not endure: and it contains these [fetuses] which, although multiplied, are one: and they are separated by the navel cord of each of them
And sometimes they come out like a single fetus through a natural birth: easily: and sometimes they come out through an unnatural birth, as we have said.
If there are any difficulties with some of them at the birth, and they arrive at that which we have mentioned from unnatural figures, then care for them as we have said: and let the midwife be gentle, and do what she does with ease and delay, and adapt to every figure as she is prepared for it from the ingenuity guiding her to safety
Remember that its formation is in the womb from embryos, and it is aborted.
When it is formed in the womb, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and many ten: and I have seen that a woman has aborted seven, and another fifteen, all of them being formed
Since it is established by the measurement of a glorious wise man.
Therefore all this must be known in the science of Obstetrics. Perhaps it will come to the like of this: let it be opposed to that which must be opposed to it.
Chapter LXXVI.
Of the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you care for a dead fetus with medicine as I have said in the discourse, and it does not go out, and you must do it by operation with the hands, then you must consider
If a healthy woman is virtuous, and there is no other cause for fear of loss of life: then you must cause the woman to lie down over the bed, over her back, and let her head be inclined downwards, and her legs be raised: and the minister should hold the patient firm from two parts, or bind her to the bed, so that her body is not pulled out during the extraction of the fetus
Then moisten the os matricis with oily things with high mucilage, with alum, and poppy seed meal.
Then let the Obstetrician wet his hand with these things and oils: then he will introduce it into the womb with ease Then seek the place where the nails of the fetus are fixed, and the convenient place for it
Consider therefore at all times, if the fetus is prepared to descend upon his head: then fix the hooks in his eyes, or in his neck, or in his mouth, or in his palate, or under his beard, or in his armpits, or in the nearby parts of his ribs, and under his navel.
If he has descended upon his feet, then in the flanks and the middle ribs.
It is necessary to hold the hook with the right hand: and place the curvature of his hand in that which is between the left thumb and little finger: and introduce it with the thumb with ease, and fix the hook in some of those places which we mentioned until it reaches the desired thing
Then fix the other or the third hook, if necessary: so that there is an equal tension, and it does not incline to one side.
Then extend the extension equally, and do not let it extend only according to the rule of the straight line, but move it to all parts, so as to alleviate his exit: just as it is done with a tooth when extracting it.
And it is necessary at that point to soften the extension. Which if it is retained from that part, then it is necessary for the obstetrician to grasp some of his fingers with his thumb and introduce them from the side, so that he may rotate with what is retained
If therefore his part of the fetus comes out, then exchange the hooks to another place which is higher: do this until the whole fetus comes out
If therefore his hand comes out before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its adhesion: then it is necessary to cover over his hand with the palm of the hand Then extract the thumb when it goes out, either at the joint of the thumb and the palm, or in the cubit: and so it should be done in the other hand, and in both feet.
If however the head of the fetus is large, or if there is a constriction in its exit, or if there is water in its head: then it should be introduced between the fingers of Spatumile spinosum, and find with it the head, and extract the water: or break it with the instrument which is called Almisdac: whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the following chapter.
Likewise do this if the fetus is of great head size: then it should be severed with the clamp: or extract it with the hook, as we have said. Then draw out the bones with forceps.
When the head comes out, and is caught at the collar: then it is found, until the humidity which is in the chest is discharged
If however it does not become complicated, neither obeys the exit: then cut off the head roughly, as much as possible for you
If however the lower belly is apostemated, or there is water in it: then it should be perforated, until the humidity comes out from it.
If however the fetus is above his feet: then its traction is easy, and its direction to the maternal bone is smooth
If however it is constricted in the belly, or the chest: then it should be extracted with the cloth which you have covered over your hand: and find the belly, or the chest, until it comes out naturally
If however the rest of the limbs are delivered, and the head returns: then the Obstetrix puts in his left hand. If any opening is found in the matrix, then the hand is introduced into the depth of the matrix, and it grasps with the head, and pulls it until it reaches the os of the matrix. Then one or two hooks are introduced into it, and it is pulled with them.
If the os of the matrix is closed, because of a thick clot that has happened to it: then it is not necessary to toil over it, rather it is necessary to administer an effusion of moist things, fats: and administer plasters. And sit in the waters that soften and moisten them.
If the fetus is above its side, then it is possible to equalize it: then the thing which we said concerning the fetus above is administered for it
If it is not possible to do this, then a perforation is made carelessly, and it is extracted
And it is necessary that you do not let anything escape from the second part altogether.
When you have completed your operation, then administer what we said concerning the cold clots which happen in the matrixes.
If blood flows, then descend into the styptic waters, and administer the rest of the treatment.
And I myself have seen a woman in whom there was a dead fetus: then it was impregnated over her again with oil, afterwards the other fetus also died. It happened to her after a long time that a clot formed in her navel, and it became inflated, until it opened: and pus began to emit from it.
I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time: and it did not consolidate.
I placed over it some strong-adhesive plaster: and it came out from its place. Then some days passed by, and another bone was discharged. I am amazed at this, for there is no bone within.
I think therefore, because there were dead bones of a fetus within.
I asked the woman, and she extracted many bones from me, which were in a better position: and I did so without pain for a long time, and I sent out a little pus from that place.
And I did not touch this foreign thing, except that there is knowledge in it, and help for that which the skilled physician gives with his hands from the art of healing.
Chapter 77.
Concerning the forms of the necessary instruments for extracting a fetus.
The form of the ring which opens the matrix
Here below is the form of the Strictor, with which the books are equaled, having two rings equally distant at the extremities of two sticks. Indeed these rings must be subtler than the strictor: and that they may be made either of ebony or of seasoned wood
And the width of each stick is like two fingers: and the margin of each of them is like a single finger, and the length of each of them is from the wrist to the middle of the palm: and in the middle of the two sticks are two additional pieces of the same kind of wood, which are fastened in both, whose length is half the palm and a little less: and the width of each is like two fingers, or less
And these two additions are introduced into the matrix bone, so that it opens when you rotate the two rings.
Another form like that, subtler and smoother.
Made from ebony wood or horn, according to the shape of the forceps.</start_of_turn> Indeed, at its extremities there are two appendages, as here above: and the length of each appendage is like the palm of the hand, and the width of each is like two fingers.</start_of_turn
When you wish to open the matrix with this, then make her sit over a lectum, with her feet hanging down, and open what is between her thighs.</start_of_turn Then introduce these two appendages joined together into the matrix: and you hold the lower extremity of the instrument between her thighs.</start_of_turn Then open your hand with the instrument, like you do with forceps, equally according to the quantity of the opening of the matrix, until the Obstetrix wishes to stop.</start_of_turn
Another kind of Vertigo is called "Impelling Force" by the ancient writers.</start_of_turn
The "Almisdac" form, by which the great head is countered: and it is assimilated to the forceps, which have teeth at the extremities, like the hooks.</start_of_turn
And when it is oblunged, like the forceps in this form, like the hooks, which have teeth like those of a saw, with which it incides and counters.</start_of_turn
The surrounding form which has one spine.</start_of_turn
The surrounding form which has two spines.</start_of_turn
The form of the Spatumilis has two extremities to abscind the head.
The form of two Spatumilis also has two extremities.
These instruments are all used, and the more numerous the kinds of them are that are prepared by the artificer, the faster will be the operation and the greater will be its effect on men, on account of their quantity
There is no need to despise any of these instruments, for they are all prepared for you It is not unreasonable to expect these things of them
Head LXXVIII
About the extraction of the Second
When the Second is retained in the part, then it is necessary to grasp the lower part, in order to retain the breath Then make the incision with the forceps: and grasp the hand over his jaw, and take hold of his breath. If he comes out through this, that is good
If not: then grasp his head, and pierce in the middle of the cheek: and place in it herbs that open the bone like fennel, rue, and plantain, and chamomile, and hyssop, and cassia twig, and centaury: grasp all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them with water, and place them over fire.
Then place a poultice of reeds over the hole of the cheek and the other extremity in the bone of the matrix: and hold it until the vapor has reached the depth of the matrix
Then make the incision as we have said before The Second will come out easily
If, however, after this treatment, the patient remains and does not depart: then command the Obstetrician to immerse his hand in pure sesame oil, or in high mucilage. Then plunge it into the belly, and seek with it the Second [i.e., the uterus]. When it has grasped it, then take hold of it, and extend it little by little.
If, however, the appendix be in the depth of the belly, then plunge the hand in, as we have mentioned, until it grasps the Second [i.e., the uterus], and draw it out little by little along the straight line, so that the belly does not tear from excessive tension: it is necessary therefore to mix [the procedure] with facilitating movements towards the right and left: and afterwards add in the quantity of tension. It will then obey, and be restored, and depart from the adhesion.
As for the os of the belly being closed [i.e., contracted], as we have mentioned: care for it with sternutation, and from an oil medication with herbs.
If, however, it does not depart with all that we have mentioned: then beware lest you tire yourself out in the course of the extraction process.
It is true that it should depart from the os of the belly to the woman's hip. Then administer an enema with four drugs. This will cause the belly to soften after a few days, and dissolve, and depart
Indeed when it has putrefied, it will emit a foul smell from the belly and head, and will cause pain which will make the patient weak. It is necessary therefore that suitable fumigations be administered for this.
Some of the ancient experts are experienced in fumigation with nasturtium and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated for the retention of the second [menstrual] blood and the period.
Let it be like a cauldron, or a jar: and put the wide end over the flame: and let the fumigation rest on the berries: hold it there until the fumigation is consumed: and do it again another time
Chapter 79.
Concerning the care of an unpierced animal
Many boys are born with their nails unpierced, whom I have seen to have been oiled with subtle saffron. It is necessary therefore that the midwife pierce that nail with her finger: and if not, pierce it with the pointed Spatumili: and beware tears, lest it touch him
Then put upon it infused wool in wine and oil. Then care for it with the nails, until it is healed.
If indeed it is to be oiled, then put in the hole a lead cannula for many days, and take it away when the boy wants to urinate.
And indeed the oiling of an animal may also be from the consolidation of the wound, or after-effect. It is necessary therefore that the consolidation be dried, then care for it as we said before concerning the care and lead
Chapter 80
Concerning the care of fistulas which happen in the lower part
Fistulas which happen in the lower part are Nodulation and Swelling which happen near any limb: or in the space of one part: and there is one fistula, or more
When the old Nodatio is relaxed, it opens and white watery moisture or subtle pus issues from it.
Or when there are penetrating fistulas from them. They are recognized by that which comes out with the discharge and by swelling, when the patient is in pain: and perhaps comes out with worms.
There are fistulas when they extend from the penetrating area to the cavity or to the muscle of the belly And from the penetrating area to the hip joint, and to the knot of the tailbone
From this, however, it is recognized that the penetrating fistula is known until it reaches the anus, even if it is not penetrating, as when you insert your finger into the anus: and you insert a needle sub-externally into the fistula from outside.
If there is a twist in it, then introduce in the gut a lead needle or a hair from a horse's tail until you feel the needle or hair, or until the hair comes out on your finger
If you do not feel the needle itself, neither that anything comes out with the discharge, neither swelling, neither worms as I have said: then you know that it is not penetrating: take care of the cure then.
When the fistula is penetrating until the cavity or the bladder muscle: then its meaning is the discharge of urine from it, and the prohibition of this so that the place may be consolidated with the physicians.
When it is penetrating until the hip joint or the hip bone: then its sign is that the attempt reaches up to this point, if there is no twist up to the bone: and a sensation of pain in the circumference of the part, and that pus always comes out from it: and that there is no benefit in it from the medication, neither is it consolidated with oil
In these penetrating fistulas, there is no complete cure: the cure is toil and perseverance from the stupid doctors who form them.
In these non-penetrating and non-ancient fistulas, healing is expected with a clamp: as I have said before, and as I have proved: let the patient lie between your hands over his belly: elevate his limbs until above his knees, and let his knees bend towards his belly Then introduce lead or air into the fistula, if there is a tortuousness in the fistula, until you know where it ends.
If, however, the patient feels around the belly, then you must introduce your finger into the belly.
If you feel in your finger that it is attempting to penetrate through the recognized area, except for what you feel between your finger and the flesh, or carrion: then you know for certain that it is penetrating: there is no work in this, because it is not its cure, as we have said
They say that in some people, the cure is in the flesh itself, and from the medicine which is expected to be applied: thus you should apply gentle cautery under the breadth of the fistula, as has been said before, and introduce the flame itself into the fistula until it disappears from around the belly Then do this twice or thrice, until you know that all the fatty flesh which is similar to the veins of a bird's wing has been consumed by the filter.
Then care for it with buttered bandages until those fatty tissues have gone: then care for it with unguents that generate flesh and consolidate.
If it heals well, that is good.
If not, it does not recover with any other treatment at all.
If not, it does not recover even if you take away the finger that is in the groin and that is between the thumb and the fleshy swelling from the bone, or if you lance it: and you should know that if you do this, dry the skin from the start of the fistula, and take away the fleshy swelling with the thumb that is in the fistula, until the drying out reaches the end of the swelling, and the fleshy swelling is freed.
Then wash the surrounding flesh thoroughly, so that no pus remains from the cannula of feathers of birds.
If, however, blood flows and mixes with you and the operation, so that you must cut through the flesh: then it is better that you cauterize with fire or with acute medicine.
For indeed, cauterization with fire unites the good habits, brings together the added flesh, and stops bleeding, and dries up moisture
Then care for it with cloths dipped in butter, or with bruised grapes, until the place discharges pus, and the added flesh is expelled in the pus.
Then care for it with solid bandages, containing substances that promote the formation of tough flesh: and these are medicines that have stypticity and drying qualities.
For when it is healed, then it is cured: and not by doing it repeatedly.
If, however, the fistula has persisted to the depth of the abdomen, and has become prolonged by the excess of the body: then insert your finger into the abdomen and inquire about it
If you feel the fleshy swelling and between you and the fistula is close to penetration: then there is no operation in this case, except according to the degree of trust and hope
Whatever is done by one of three methods: either by cauterizing it as we have said; or by dissecting it until its concavity is complete, so that one may afterwards insert instruments and perform the cure. Proceed not too far with the dissection, lest you cut through the membrane of any organ, and cause an unfavorable outcome of the evacuation without the will of the patient Then care for that which we have said.
Perhaps it will recover: or you may stretch the membrane and cleanse it when dry, as we have said, or with hooks, or with some other sharp instrument. Then cleanse the excised tissues which are in the dissection, until fat remains only with the scarp.
Then endeavor to restore the entire wound with the dissection, and the upper orifice where it is closed: and there will remain an open fistula in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier over the infirmity.
And when the fistula is sutured in this way: that is, when you insert a hook into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the skin and the margin of the anus: then grasp the hook with the perforating extremity, which is like a needle, that is, prepared for cutting the skin, in this shape And insert into it a thread of silk wound from five threads, and pass it around it. Then insert the hook with the thread into the fistula, until its concavity is complete
If, however, it is penetrating into the inner margin of the anus, then draw out the thread from that hole: so that you may insert your finger into the anus, and draw out the extremity of the thread, and join the two extremities together: and bind them so that neither slips, and leave it like that for one day, or two days: and the more the thread has penetrated the flesh, the better you must bind it, until those parts of the flesh which are between the two extremities of the thread have become soft and fallen away: then care for the wound, until it is consolidated and healed
If the opening of the Fistula is not penetrable: then make it so in whatever way is prepared for you, except that it be in great depth. Except that it be in great depth, make it so in whatever way is prepared for you
Except that it be in great depth, make it so in whatever way is prepared for you until it is healed.
The form of the spindle which is found in the Fistula, whose curvature is acute upwards and the other part is not acute, so that it does not damage that which is not necessary, like urine.
Chapter 81.
Concerning the suture of Hemorrhoids from which blood runs from the incision of them: and the care of the incisions.
There are Hemorrhoids in two ways. They are either inside the rectum, like pieces of charcoal or prunes, or they are like the seeds of the lotus And they are either small or large: and blood runs from them always, and there is one, and there are many And they are outside the rectum, and at their extremities
However, those which are outside the rectum are mostly small and emit yellow urine, or a slight flow of blood: and they are according to the colour of the body.
And the care of those which are inside the rectum is to make the patient sit upright: and to expel, until the anus goes out, and they appear small to you Therefore hold it suspended with hooks: or hold it with your finger Then cut it at the root of them
If they do not remain within the loop due to moisture of the wound and their softening: then cover them with rough cloth or a coat of lanolin from wool, and extract them with your fingers. Then cut them out, and powder over them after cutting whatever powder you wish, so that they remain in place like cautery Or cauterize them as it is written in the chapter on cautery. Then care for the wound with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
If it does not obey the anus in its evacuation, then instill a small dose of laxative in the belly where there is a bite, so that it will be evacuated quickly, when the infirmum discharges itself
If they are outside the anus, then it is easy: grasp them with your finger or with a loop, and cut them off.</start_of_turn> Then care for the wound as we have said, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
And whoever dislikes an incision with a knife, then he must administer a suture of them in this way.</start_of_turn Take a thread that has been wound up, and introduce it into the hollow.</start_of_turn Then draw out the little ones upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root from the other side: and tie two knots of the thread at the lower part of the needle, and let them be lateral: and tighten the little one tightly.</start_of_turn Then knot the thread, and draw out the needle.</start_of_turn
Do this with all the little ones, and discharge from the wound one at a time: neither their own, lest there should be excess blood from it.</start_of_turn
Then place above the wound a soaked sponge in rose-water, or vinegar, and place the sponge above the wound: and command the patient to rest. Then leave it until it falls off naturally.
When they fall off of themselves, care for them with unguents, and leave the rest of the treatment until they are healed.
Of the care of wounds.</start_of_turn> Many are caused by the evacuation of stool, and the constriction of nature.</start_of_turn
When they are thus diminished, and do not avail themselves of medical treatment: then it is necessary to apply mustard seeds with the thumb, or with your finger, until they are softened, and the outer layer which hinders adhesion is removed.</start_of_turn Then care for the wound, until it is consolidated as it should be.</start_of_turn
If, however, they do not consolidate: then repeat the wound with greater reason than at first, until they bleed much, and are then cleansed with care, until they are healed.</start_of_turn>
Of the care of burns of the body, not of the wound: and of blisters, and of ants.</start_of_turn
Chapter 82.</start_of_turn>
You know that a burn is not anything but a round knot according to the colour of the body, like the head of a nail: and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and the fingers: and it occurs from pain during walking.</start_of_turn
It is necessary therefore to cut around the nail and hold it with forceps, or with a needle, and extirpate it from its root.</start_of_turn
Then care for that: and if you wish to cauterize it, do so as it precedes in its chapter.
And thus there is always one prominence which is small, rough, filtered, and rounded above the surface of the body And they are found in the hands of children many times
And its care is that you extend the prominence and break it: or bind it with a silken thread: or with hair, until it falls off And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is mentioned with fire, or with sharp medicine: and thus you will eradicate the reversed prominence, and not the natural one, with the instrument which I shall mention.
There is also a small, filtered prominence, large, above the surface of the body, which extends downwards into the depths: and when it encounters cold, it feels like the bite of a flea, and it causes pain throughout the body: and most of it happens in the hands
And its care is that you take a needle from the wing of a bird, or a strong hair, and put it over the Flea, until the circle of the needle encompasses part of it Then withdraw your hand with the needle, until you have severed what is around the Flea: and you put it deep into the flesh, and you extract the Flea from its root
And if you wish, do it with an air needle, or a needle of iron, according to this form.
Let the upper part of the needle reach the tip of the swelling, so that it alleviates the tension on the finger and its retraction
And if you wish, cauterize the Flea according to what is mentioned in the chapter on cauterization of the prominence
Concerning the forms of instruments which are administered to Clisteria in ailments of the soul, and the solution of the inner parts, and the colic.
Concerning the forms of instruments which are administered to Clisteria in ailments of the soul, and the solution of the inner parts, and the colic.
When Clistera is made from silver, or gold, or blown glass, or hammered out.
And when made from these instruments, small and large, according to those which are administered
This is done in the treatment of young children who are feeble or painful, as well as Clisteria themselves
A large Clistera
The upper head of it in which the uterus is bound, be wide in this way: and there should be a distinction so that the uterus is bound like water, and its lower extremity which goes into the belly, be dull, that is, not open, soft, gentle, stretching to thinness: and on one side there are two holes, and on the other side one hole
And the width of the hole be according to the thickness of the ribs, and less broadly, and the uterus in which the medicines are placed from the animal's urine: or from paper like the asphodel of the small one: whose root is a single palm.
And it is perforated with many holes as it is rolled about, and there is space between every hole as wide as a finger Then insert into these holes a strong thread from raw thread, which be from ten threads, or about these, and bind together with it the uterus like asphodel. When it is thus placed in this uterus, it is strung in the head of the Clistera between two distinguishing constrictions of strength. Then cleanse the wound with it.
And this is the form of the circle which is here drawn, and of the holes.
The quality of the cleansing with it is: that you apply either a portion of earth or a medicine which is warmed according to the quantity of the patient's tolerance: and take care that it is neither too hot nor too cold, neither too warm nor too cold.
Then the patient lies on his back, and lifts his legs up towards the shoulders: and put under it fat, that is, skin which men lie upon, or linen
Then wash the limb with oil, or with alum or with mucilage of barley, or like these. Then insert it into the wound with ease. Then take hold of the limb with both hands and press it with pressure, until it has evacuated everything which is in the wound into the intestines
Then remove the Clister and lift the patient's legs to the side
And if the medicine orders you to leave it, then keep it as much as you can And if he sleeps with it all night, it is most excellent in healing
But if you cleanse it with the solution of vinegar and it speeds up its healing: then cleanse it again until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the year: then let the Clister be subtle and cold, soft, from the Clisters which are used to cleanse children.</start_of_turn>
And this is the form of the subtle Clister which is over the strict skin.</start_of_turn>
Head wounds without bone fracture.
I have already spoken concerning the treatment of wounds in general, which is contained in the book. Here I will speak of the treatment of these wounds with the hand and with the aid of physicians according to their custom
Wounds are of various kinds according to the cause of the wound and the place where the wound has fallen
Wounds are thus of various kinds, as when caused by a stone, or by a sword or knife, or by a blow with a spear or wood or arrow, or by like things
Wounds which are caused in different parts of the body are also of various kinds, as for example a wound which falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the stomach, or the limb: or like those on the joints
And I will speak of the treatment of other wounds, so as to give the reason and rule concerning the rest of the wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds: for the memory of the compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say thus. When a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture of the bone: then consider whether it is from a stone or something similar. Then break only the skin: and the wound is great and the time for the inflammation of the surrounding area is great: then proceed with care and perform a cephalic phlebotomy immediately: do not delay this: and extract from him from the blood according to the quantity of his virtue. If there is anything which prohibits phlebotomy, especially if there is little blood flowing from the wound, do not do it And let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the wounded part. And let the patient beware of repletion (excess), of wine, and of coarse food
If, however, something hinders the reduction (of the wound), then let the food be diminished, not increased, and let meat and wine be avoided
And let there be placed upon the wound if it happens to have a thick scab, a cushion of infused alum on pure salt, or with wine in which there is styptic action.
If, however, you are secure from the thick scab, then let there be placed upon the wound, if there is a clot adhering to the blood, and has not altered its air, some powder which I will tell you of later: and if it has altered the air, then let there be placed upon it some unguent until it is healed
If, however, the wound is large, or is from a wound made by a sword, and the like: and the edges do not adhere by little hairs, then let them be brought together with sutures, as I shall say concerning the sutures of these wounds
If, however, the wound has been detected from a bone, and hangs loose, and its retention is not necessary except in a small suspension: then cut it off Then care for the wound with physicians, and restore to it solid flesh in the place of the skin, and command the patient, that he eat coarse food, such as heads, and cooked barley, until the pulse be regular: and similar things.
If you find in the wound corruption, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut away the corrupted part entirely, and cast it out: then care for the wound
If, however, in these wounds there is an artery, or vein from which blood flows: and it is not severed by medicines, then inquire concerning the artery If then you find the wound not closed, you must dry it with Spatumili, or bind it up. If necessity compels you when it does not conform to what we have said, then cauterize the wound until the blood is excised
If the wound is small and simple, then the matter is easy and light: thus as to powder over it this powder: because it strengthens it before it changes from air
Method of applying powdered gypsum. Recipe: mix one part of olive oil, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unburnt lime: grind them all together, and make a paste: apply it to the wound, and bind it securely, until it adheres well to the wound itself and is clotted with blood.
Then string the wound over with lint, and let it go, neither wash it until it has healed, so that it does not burst open For it is not driven out by medicine until it has healed.
And when it does make this calcification alone, when there is neither oil nor dragon's blood in it, it does the same operation in many great wounds when it happens that it is placed over them and bound, and when there are fresh wounds with their own blood, which have not altered from air.
When it has altered the air somewhat by any alteration, especially when it is in summer, then the intention of this powdered gypsum is not there: care for it as we have said, thus as to place over it some digestive unguent: or place over it balls of barley flour made with water and honey, until pus comes out of it Then care for the rest of the cure until it heals
If indeed it happens that there is a fracture of a bone and it is small, then extract it with a grasper: and I will tell you the treatment of head fractures in this which the future is.
Of head fractures.
If indeed it happens that there is a fracture of a bone and it is small, then extract it with a grasper: and I will tell you the treatment of head fractures in this which the future is.
If indeed it happens that there is a fracture of a bone and it is small, then extract it with a grasper: and I will tell you the treatment of head fractures in this which the future is. If however the nerve of the head is cut, or an artery: then if it is a nerve, it is not in vain that it is fractured, except that it must be treated with something which brings about hemostasis, such as sponges and eggs, and things of that kind. For indeed the nerves are unknown, and against them there is no remedy.
And do not put anything cold on the wound at all: for the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuity is with the brain, which is the soul of the limbs: and let this be how it is cured by physicians gently, such as lime with honey or with rose oil and pitch, when it is washed even with sweet water: and the rest of the mineral stones, according to this method, and oily unguents.
If indeed the fracture is large, then administer a suture: or close its lips with wool. Then care for it until it heals
If indeed the wound is deep, or has happened in a sinus in its lower part, in which pus is gathered, then perforate it in a depressed place in that place
If indeed a blood vessel has been cut, and its blood flow has followed: then separate it, or dry it up, and bind it: or cauterize it, if that is necessary for this.
If, however, the teeth have penetrated the guttur, either completely or partially, and the gums are swollen: then aggregate the lips of the skin with a suture above the canine tooth of the guttur, and do not touch the guttur itself, but rather equalize it with the surrounding area, and reduce it to its natural position. Then tighten it with a proper suture, and discharge it in a few days. Then care for it with unguents in which there is stickiness and exudation, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
If, however, a nail has made an imprint in the bone, then inquire about it: then if there are fragments of bone in the same, extract them all, or whatever can be extracted from it: and what cannot be prepared, discharge it, since the nail will putrefy and separate and the discharge will be alleviated.</start_of_turn>
And if the nail has been embedded, then grind over it with the powder which I mentioned before.</start_of_turn> If, however, it is seen in the nail, and a fistula has formed: then care for it as is fitting for its situation in its chapter.</start_of_turn>
Of the nail in the palate.</start_of_turn>
If there is percussion of a lance or a knife, and you see its depth, then consider it.</start_of_turn If, therefore, from the nail there escapes blood, when he breathes out from it the sick person, then you know that the nail is mortal.</start_of_turn
If, however, it does not have great depth, and is embedded with blood: then do not immediately grind over it, or suture it, so that the blood does not remain in its depth, and return to the heart, and kill the patient: but put in it a nourishing unguent, and leave it for two days.</start_of_turn
If indeed an unguentum is not present, then place in the opening of the wound a seasoned cushion, that it may absorb what proceeds from it from the humilities: and cause the patient to sleep upon the wound, that it may mend what accumulates in it.
If indeed three days or more have passed since the wound, and no spasm or bad tremor of the heart, nor bad breath, nor stricture in the bowels, and the patient's other conditions are good: then you know that the wound is healed.</start_of_turn> Care for it diligently and with treatments, and with other cares, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
If indeed the healing is excused, and it always opens, then you know that a fistula has been made.</start_of_turn> Care for it from its chapter.</start_of_turn
And if the wound is from a cut of a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the breast or back: then care for it with that which precedes from the suture, if it is large: or with dust, if it is small.</start_of_turn
But if indeed it has made an impression in the bone, and has broken from it: then inquire about the wound, and properly extract that which is separated.</start_of_turn But if indeed they are not separated, then leave them alone, until the wound putrefies, alleviating the extraction of them.</start_of_turn
As for the rest of the accidents of wounds in the rest of the limbs, the judgment in their care is their own.</start_of_turn
Of wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestine, and the issue of them.</start_of_turn
The disruption which happens from inside is great, middle, or small.
It is great when the intestine or the number of intestines comes out from the great one
Therefore there is an introversion of the bowels, and the suture is more difficult and arduous
And the small disruption is also difficult in another way Therefore, it follows that the reduction is more difficult if you do not properly perform the introversion back to its place immediately: because it swells, opens, and swells up: and thus the entrance of it becomes difficult.
Therefore, the middle disruption is better: because with this one the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is with the two other kinds
You know that the suture of the belly is according to four methods.
Two sutures are common in the suture of the belly, and in the suture of the remaining wounds of the body: and two other sutures are proper for the rest of the wounds. However, there are other methods which are more proper for the suture of the belly: and I will narrate one of them with its exposition and declaration
I say, because when the wound is small, and something from the intestine comes out of it, and it is difficult to reduce it: then it is for one of the two methods. Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said: or because of the inflation of the intestine due to the cold of the air
When it is like this, then one must warm it up, so that you may immerse a sponge or a wet towel in warm water Or boil them in water a little bit, and cypress, and fennel, and embroil with them the intestines, until the swelling is resolved.
When it makes that liquid in which there is stickiness: it is better than plain water in resolving the swelling.
When you have thus resolved the swelling, then moisten the intestines with the water in which they have been boiled, either high or low. For thus it alleviates its entrance with a small thing.
If, however, its return is delayed after this treatment, then find in slight disruption, with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better when it is prepared than the section: and does not cause a pressing need to cut after necessity and the fault of the instrument.
Let one part be sharp and acute, and the other part not acute: and the extremity should not be fine like that of Spatumilis, but rather obtuse like a bean: and this is what resembles a wound, like the liquid
When the wound is thus strengthened, and the intestine is introduced, then it should be brought about that there is a reduction of it according to its natural form in its own place, if possible over that: because that is better
When indeed the disruption is wide in the lower part of the belly: then it should be made to lie flat on its back, and place its knees higher than its head. And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place its head, and its chest higher than its lower parts
And similarly if there is a disruption in two parts of the belly, then place your intention and your consideration always in this, that the part in which the wound is should be higher than the other part.
It is thus necessary that the surgeons perform this work in large wounds and in medium wounds.
In small wounds, however, place this [dressing] according to what is prepared for you
Then make it so that your hands rest comfortably between your fingers, which hold the entirety of the hand together: and gather its lips together. Then draw out from it [the wound] whatever follows the suture one thing after another: and this is the manner of common suture of one
And it is necessary that you take an awl, or the number of awls according to the quantity of the wound's breadth. Then withdraw from the edge of the disruption the quantity of the finger of the hand, namely the physician: and fix the awl one beyond which you enter into the skin in two extremities of the skin, with two extremities of fat which is under the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from another side, and you gather together two extremities of the skin and two extremities of fat: and there are four orders thus formed
Then bind with a double thread around the circumference of the awl several times from two parts together, until two lips of the wound are gathered together by a decent aggregation.
Then withdraw the length of the finger also, and fix in the flesh another awl: afterwards tighten the skin with the thread, as you did with the first awl. Do not cease to do this until you have completed the constriction of the whole wound
And the middle awls between the length and the thickness: because the fine awls slip easily through flesh: and the thick ones are difficult to enter the skin: for this reason it is necessary that they be of middle thickness in the skin, and thick
It is not permissible that a needle should remain in two contiguous parts of the skin for a long time: for the flesh will otherwise quickly decay and a wound will open before consolidation has taken place, and will not be lengthened even when sutured, for it will be prevented from consolidating by the suture.
Then pierce the extremity of the needle, so that it does not wound the patient during sleep: and place wool pads around the needle from all sides, which will hold the needle in place: and draw it out, until you know that the wound has consolidated
And this is the kind of suture which is most suitable for small wounds For indeed one, or two, or several needles suffice in a suture.
The second common suture is that in which four extremities are bound together: two of the skin and two of the fat in one wound, with the needle through which the thread is passed being equal in thickness and consistency.
Then when you have pierced with the needle the four extremities, reduce the needle from the part from which you began, so that the thread be drawn out from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture be like the stitching of cloth. Place between every suture as much thickness as the breadth of a little finger
This kind of suture they know already.
And when I did this suture to him, the wound which had happened to him in his belly, which had been wounded with a knife, and was a disruption of the greater part of the intestine for two palms: and it had escaped from the intestines about two palms from the middle intestine, and there was a disruption in the middle of the belly
I reduced it therefore after it had rested outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
The swelling has subsided in the space where it remained for about fifteen days; I have treated it, and it has healed: and since then it has not returned, having become accustomed to its own condition.
The physicians declared that it would not recover.</start_of_turn>
And indeed, a miracle occurred, for I did not treat it with unguent.</start_of_turn> Because I was in a place where unguent was not to be found, neither did I have any from the physicians.</start_of_turn I placed upon the swelling a warm compress twice a day, and I bathed it with scented water until it healed.</start_of_turn>
I used two kinds of sutures according to the narration of the sermon.</start_of_turn>
And it is that you begin with the acute suture: and you insert the point from the exterior to the interior part.</start_of_turn
When the needle has penetrated the skin, and has reached the abscess according to the length and breadth of the whole body: withdraw the point of the needle in the side in which you inserted the point, and make penetrate from the inside outwards at the opposite end.</start_of_turn
When you have thus made the penetration, then make the penetration once more in the same place outwards from the outside, and withdraw the point which is in this side, and make the needle penetrate from the inside outwards in the opposite end: and withdraw the point which is in this side, and make the needle penetrate again from the inside outwards in the opposite end, until it has penetrated the whole abscess.</start_of_turn
And then begin also from this side, and tie it with the point which is outside, and withdraw the needle from the skin where it penetrated.
Then reduce the skin to that area, and its outer limit to the side which is opposite to that which has the mark: and draw out the skin from that part which is on the side of it, and make it one with this, and the other: and make this one after the other, until its outer limit is like that example.
And the sum of all these sutures is like the sutures of the leatherworkers which join skins: so that you make one from one side of the skin-edge: and you let go of the other from the other side, until you have completed it.</start_of_turn>
The second kind of suture which Gale has spoken of.
This is the way in which he has spoken, that you must join all parts according to their similarity, as do some physicians, so that you join the outer limit of the skin to the outer limit which is opposite to it, and the outer limit which has the mark to the outer limit which is opposite to it.</start_of_turn> And this is done according to what I have told you.</start_of_turn>
It is necessary that the ligature be made in the outer limit which has the mark, close to the outside, and that you make the skin penetrate inwards only in that place: and you let go of the two skin-edges.</start_of_turn Then draw up the ligature, and make the skin penetrate from the outside inwards through the two skin-edges, namely on both sides.</start_of_turn
Then draw up both of them, and also make them penetrate both from the inside outwards through the two outer limits, to the two other outer limits which are on the opposite side.</start_of_turn
And this way of suturing is better than the common way, and is the suture whose progress is remembered.</start_of_turn
This is indeed the word of Galen.
Some have said this before Galen.</start_of_turn> The gut suture is corrected with two squares.</start_of_turn> That is, insert in the belly two threads: and begin with the insertion of the needle from where it is to you, and make it penetrate until it reaches the opposite side, following the suture that is between the layers of skin.</start_of_turn
You know that when the middle of the gut is ruptured: then the suture of that is more difficult than that of the rest of the gut.</start_of_turn
The judgment of the healing of an ulcer is the judgment of the healing of the rest of the ulcers.</start_of_turn
That is, because when you follow an ulcer with its own blood, before it changes itself: and you reduce the intestine, and hold it, and put over it the powder of incense.</start_of_turn
If the air has changed the ulcer: then put over it some unguents that are in your presence, until they make pus: and the thread breaks, and consolidates the mucus, and heals.</start_of_turn Then care for it in the same way as the healing of the rest of the ulcers, until it heals.</start_of_turn
But if there are no remedies available, then put over it immediately, from which it begins to emit pus, a soft tumor: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.</start_of_turn
For you must not apply other remedies to many conditions, when the ulcers are simple.</start_of_turn
If, however, you are afraid that the ulcer communicates with the principal parts of the body in its lesion, then you must immerse fine wool in lukewarm oil, or in rose oil: and put it around the parts between the groin and the armpits.</start_of_turn
If he feels pain, or swelling, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens to him), then let him drink a cluster of wine with black vinegar and warm water: especially if the putrefaction has already penetrated the intestine, and an opening has been made through it until it reaches its cavity.
And know that that which is excised from the great intestine is easier to heal: and that which is excised from the small intestine is more difficult to heal.
The small intestine, however, which is called Ieiunum, does not suffer healing from the wound which occurs in it throughout: and this is because of the multitude of its veins, and the greatness of their number, and because of the subtleness of its body, and because of the proximity of its nature to the nerves
If, however, that which proceeds from the wound is a bone, and you see it, do you not remove it? Reduce it according to your reduction which you make of the intestines equally.
If, however, it has passed beyond that space, and is black or dark: then it is necessary to ligate it with a thread above the place which is rent in it, so that there may not be a flow of blood. For in a bone there are veins and arteries.
Then cut that which is beyond that ligament, and put two hanging threads from the lower part of the wound outside of it: so as to support above its traction, and extraction of it from the case of the bone, and emission of the pus of the wound.
Remember the wound which occurs in the Intestine.
When a disruption occurs in the Intestine, and it is small: then it is possible, in certain persons, that it will be restored: because I saw one who was wounded in the belly by a lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and was old: and there was made a fistula, and it went out of itself through an egestion, and there was a swelling.
I leave it until the cure is complete, until I am not compelled by his condition: neither do I cease to work until he is healed and his place is firm.
Until his place is consolidated, I refrain from working on the patient, for fear of causing him further harm: neither do I leave him until that harm has ceased to exist. And I remain in better conditions, eating and drinking, trusting in God, and having bathed, exercising in my diet.
And some physicians say that when there is a wound in the intestine, even if it is small: then it is necessary to suture it in this way And it is like taking large ants. Then join together two lips of the wound, and place an ant between them over the two lips of the wound When you have put it over them, and closed its mouth, cut off its head, and bind its tail to it, and do not break it off
Then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing this until you have done as much as the size of the wound requires
Then reduce it, and suture the wound. These heads remain joined to the intestine until the intestine is healed, and is not subject to any sharp or rough document
And it is possible to suture the intestine even with a fine thread: which has been taken from the intestine of an animal, and is joined to it after it has been introduced into the knot
And take hold of the end of this thread from the intestine, and remove a great deal of it Then the thread in its extremity is passed through a fine loop of linen. Then pass the thread into the knot, and afterwards with it the intestine Then reduce it to disruption
And this method of stitching with hooks and intestine is not without risk, except according to the degree of trust and hope.
You know, a wound that is large, broad, especially if it is in a graceful intestine: then there is no skill except meticulous handling, and its healing is not at all guaranteed
Regarding care of ulcers and fistulas.
You know that every wound, or abscess when it grows old and decays, becomes an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and emits pus always, and does not heal: then it is called a fistula in every member in which it occurs.</start_of_turn>
And a fistula is indeed a filtered node, hard, white: with which there is no pain, which has the shape of a wing of a bird: and for this reason they call some of them Risati, that is, wings.</start_of_turn
And sometimes in wet weather it emits pus.</start_of_turn> And sometimes the humidity breaks in some hours.</start_of_turn And when this humidity is great and little, and is large and thin.</start_of_turn
And I say in general that any wound that does not heal, neither is born in this body, is not due to anything other than one of these causes.</start_of_turn
When one of these things is absent, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body, or because of its malice, or because between it and the lips there is a hard substance which hinders the natural growth of flesh, or because of the presence of many ulcers and pus, or because an ulcer in itself is putrid, and the matter which issues from it is of bad quality, or because the medicine is inappropriate for its treatment, or because there is corruption descending in the region which is a kind of pestilence, or by a peculiarity in the region, like that which occurs in Caesaraugusta, in which there is difficult digestion of food and a delay in its healing after a wound, by nature itself: or because in that place there is but one bone, or a number of bones.
And I have mentioned all these causes and signs of them, and their treatments with physicians. It is necessary for you to write here the treatment of fistula and stone, which is done by one operation with the hand.
You know therefore that fistula can occur in all parts of the body. There are fistulas which extend to great veins and arteries, or nerves, or the bladder, or the intestines, or the belly, or to some bones: or to some part of the backbone, or to some joint composed of several bones, such as the hand and foot. And there are those which arise from nearby parts of the great limb and are similar to these
Therefore, the fistulas of this kind are caused by difficult healings and do not receive treatment, and are associated with labor and ignorance
If however there is any fistula which does not extend to these places which I have mentioned, and if you hope and trust in its treatment, and wish to reach an understanding of it, then attempt to close it by air or by iron, since the fistula follows the straight line. Ask for help with it.</start_of_turn>
If, however, in the fistula there is a twist, then investigate it with a fine lead weight. Since lead with its softness conforms to the body, and curves around the twist
When there are many holes in the fistula, it is not possible to indicate the upper part with a hook It is necessary therefore to explore from the holes towards the holes.
For the moisture which fills the fistula, comes out through other holes, and runs from the holes.
Then inquire diligently in what way it is possible: whether it is bone or nerve, and whether the fistula is of great or little depth: or whether the fistula is one which has many holes, and lies above all that with the sum of your strength: with your questioning of the patient and the finding of pain on compression with your hand at the place, and similar signs and symptoms following.
When you have stood on all these stations truly, then go on to the treatment with confidence: and it is that you consider at that time if the fistula is close to the surface or far from the junction, or from a nerve, an artery, a vein, or a place which I have mentioned: then dry the fistula according to what has been said before from my narration, and remove what is in it from the filtration, and corrupt flesh, which is born in its orifice from the flesh, or pus, and like things: and care for it until it is healed
If, however, the fistula is of great depth and is according to the rule: then it is necessary to dissect it as deep as possible. Then remove from it all the corrupt flesh from it.
Then administer the ligature which is involved in acute medicine: and introduce it until it reaches the extent of the fistula which you have grasped with the iron: do this with the utmost care, until the acute medicine has eaten away the whole of what remains in the fistula from corruption.
Then restore the limb with the unguents which produce healthy flesh, until it is healed
If indeed it does not heal by this, then cauterize it as we have said before.
If indeed the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of that: then inquire about it, and dry it as I have told you: if it does not prevent you from doing anything from the hip joint downwards, or from the elbow downwards, as we have said
If indeed it is detected that the bone is corrupted and black: then burn it out until the corruption of it is completely removed Then care for it with that which nourishes it, until it is healed
Which if it does not heal, and emits pus like this: then you know that you have not reached the whole eradication of the corruption.
Observe it carefully further on, and make a reason for it, and bring it to perfection with your utmost skill and care
Then restore it. If indeed it heals, that is good: and if not, then you know that the corruption is profound and distant in the body, which you have not been able to overcome It is not in your power in this matter, except to yield to the nature of things.
If indeed the small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you: draw it out with fine forceps which are suitable for that.</start_of_turn>
If there are many bones, then make exquisite attraction of them all, and do not emit anything from the body with your fortitude.
If, however, it makes an emission from the humors, and there is no fear of that in the incision, or an error: then incides those humors and tissues, if there are any, and frees the bones.
If, however, you are not prepared to remove the bones from your hour, then place over it that which putrefies itself: and emit it, until it putrefies what is around the bones from the flesh and humors
And guard the limb so that it does not solidify. And the section should be closed as you closed it in your operation And put over it, if necessary, a bandage soaked in sulfur grated with oil: or a bandage soaked in Egyptian unguent or any other unguents.
For when they putrefy, these humors, and separate from the bones, the wound will be soothed by their separation and their attraction.
If, however, there is a single large bone, such as the femur or the tibia, and the like of these, and that which is corrupted from it, is great: then break it off with the utmost care, until that black and corruption is removed And then restore the limb.
If, however, that which is corrupted in it is great, and the corruption has gone through to the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to cut it off and open it up to the place where the corruption remains: then care for it until it solidifies
And I tell you what happened to me in my leg: that you may take it as an example and an assistant for your operation
A youth of about thirty years of age suffered pain in his leg, because something had moved above the middle of his body inwards, that is, from within, until it reached the leg, and there was a large swelling: and there was no external cause for it.
It has been extended for a long time with an error of the doctors, until the swelling was opened, and many materials came out with it.</start_of_turn> And after that the cure was delayed, until the leg was bandaged, and many holes were made in it: which all emitted pus and moistened the body.</start_of_turn>
They treated him for a long time with many doctors, for two years at least, but there was no skill in their art, until I saw him and washed his leg and the things which were coming out of his holes were of great size: even all the men of the place fainted, and his colour was pale.</start_of_turn>
They attempted to reach one of the holes in his body, and they reached the bone.
Then I examined all the holes: and I found that they were all communicating with each other from all parts of the leg.</start_of_turn
I treated him accordingly, and I closed up one of the holes, until I found a piece of bone: and I found that it was corrupted: for it was rotten, putrefied, and perforated, until it had penetrated as far as the marrow.</start_of_turn
I saw that what had been detected was prepared from the rotten bone.</start_of_turn
And I concluded that there was no soundness in the bone except for that corruption, which I cut off and cauterized.</start_of_turn And I cured him of it.</start_of_turn>
Then I place restoration of the wound with the physicians consolidated in a spacious area. It is not consolidated yet.</start_of_turn>
Then I tried again, and I found upon the second examination above the first detection: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I saw that what appeared to me from that corruption also appeared from the corruption itself.</start_of_turn>
Then I attempt to restore it.</start_of_turn It is not restored.</start_of_turn
I found it therefore upon the third time above all, and I did not cease to cut the bone piecemeal, and to try to restore it: and it is not restored, until I cut through the bone round about the palm of the hand, and I extracted that with its marrow.</start_of_turn
Then I restored it with the physicians, and it was consolidated quickly, and healed: and no further operation was necessary for this purpose, except for the disposition of the infirmity of the patient, and his little tolerance, and my fear of death for him, because it was threatening him in every hour from the excessive evacuation of his bowels.</start_of_turn
He is thus healed whole: and was born in the place of the hard bone, and a good disposition was made in his body, and his strength returned to him: and he returned to his usual activities: and did not suffer from any difficulty in walking ever after.</start_of_turn
But if the prominent bone in the body is fractured: then it is necessary to support it thus: take hold of the ligament, and bind it at the extremity of the prominent bone: and command someone to extend it upwards: and place another ligament from a thicker thread than the first.</start_of_turn Then bind the ligament over the flesh which is over the bone: and extend its extremity, so that you pull the flesh downwards: and you will see the flesh over the place where you wish to cut, so that it does not wound the flesh.</start_of_turn
Place wood or a board under the lower bone in the middle: for when you do this, it does not prevent the knife from cutting through decayed flesh.
The incision should be made above the corrupted area, not in its concavity, so that it does not cause further corruption of the bone: and it must not appear to the patient in its own sense, and must urge him towards its own healing process or another incision
If the bone is corrupted and does not protrude, the part which is corrupted must be continued with the part itself: and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in part of it: then remove the flesh from all sides Then place wood under the lower bone.
And then cut through from the first part where the corruption is, until the incision is continued from the other side: and let the incision be at a distance from the corruption as we have said.
If the corruption is at the junction, cut through the corrupted junction and cut the bone where the incision is continued on the other side.
If indeed the corruption is in the continuation of two junctions, then it is not within it except by abrasion.
If the corruption is in the palm of the hand, or in the sole of the foot: then things are difficult there But it is necessary that you inquire about the nature of the corruption. And scrape the wound, and wash it according to whatever way you are able, and with whatever ingenuity you can: when it does not cause you to go against the vein or the nerve.
And you know that the saws and knives for cutting bone are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their size, and their shape, and the degree of their sharpness, and their rarity Wherever it is necessary, one must prepare an instrument suitable for each kind of operation.
You know that these operations are very significant for their kind, requiring a specific instrument for each of them when one has a great deal of experience. And you must know the modes of this art, the testimony of the modes of sickness: for then you will find for each of them what is suitable from instruments for all illnesses.
I am firm in the last of this chapter concerning the number of instruments, which I shall demonstrate by examples of those which you mention, and the proof which you will experience from others.
The Shape of the other Scalpel
The Shape of Scissors for Sutures Let the head of these Scissors be in the shape of the head of a star: and their points according to the shape of the needles of an embroidery needle
And it does not suffice unless, when they touch each other's heads, they break when they are forced together, or when the bone is large and broken
The Shape of the Larger Scissors
The Shape of the Small Scissors
Shape of the wound where the edges are joined together.
Shape of the wound where the edges are closely approximated.
Shape of the wound where the edges are bent outwards at the extremities
Shape of the wound small and slight tension
This resembles a wound like a saw, and the edges are like a saw: it appears in many places because of the reason of the bones.
Shape of the wound which agrees with the reason for its perforation by bones
Its extremities are triangular, and the edges are acute
Like that of India And it is like that which must be made in respect of wounds and cuts and saw-like shapes.
Regarding the incision of the extremities, and the closure of bones.
The extremities become gangrenous, either by an external cause or an internal one.
When therefore you have treated the disease with medical remedies, and the disease does not yield to treatment: and you see that the disease has advanced to the cutting of the limb, which does not recover anything: then you must cut off that limb until the disease has ceased, so that the patient may be saved from the death or the bad consequence which results from the defect of the limb.
And the sign that this must be done is when the limb is blackened, until it is consumed: for fire burns it, or it becomes gangrenous after blackening: until that gangrene is cut away throughout the body to that extent which follows the limb, and it spreads throughout the whole body
Properly therefore with the incision, and similarly if the cause of corruption is percussion of some of the veins: as for example of the scorpionfish, and of spiders, and of bloodworms, and of things of a like nature.
If therefore corruption exists, or percussion in the extremity of a finger, then cut off the finger, and do not leave space for corruption, until it reaches the other hand
And similarly if it happens in the palm, then cut off the hand from the root of the bone, and do not leave space for corruption, until it reaches the elbow of the arm
And if it occurs in the forearm, then cut off the arm at the elbow in its joint.
If however the corruption has passed, and you see it around the elbow: then in that is the death of the patient. And to give something beyond this from the cure, is the amount of the antidote.
And do the same with the foot, when corruption occurs in the finger, then cut off the finger at one of the joints: and if it reaches the heel of the foot, then cut off the whole foot. And if it reaches the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint
What if the corruption has gone above the knee? Then it is not in that there is life, except for dismissal, and leaving the patient to death
And as to the cutting off of a limb, or preserving it, it is like this, that you string the lower ligament which you wish to cut off: and string the other ligament above the place. And stretch out one ligament downwards: and stretch out the other ligament upwards And you cut away the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a spatula of a broad kind, until the whole flesh is detached Then it happens, or it returns.
Then it happens, or it returns. It is necessary to support the entire circumference of the wound with linen, and not to touch the healthy tissue: and it is added to the patient's pain, and the swelling is calmed.
If, however, blood flows inwards during the operation, then cauterize the place quickly: or place above it some powder which absorbs blood. Then return to your medicine until it is complete.
Then bind the wounded limb with the appropriate bandage, and care for it, until it heals
And I tell you what happened to me in my foot, for this is what I tell you.
That is, because in his foot there was a blackness, with a scorching which assimilates with the burning of fire: and this corruption first happened in his finger, until the whole foot was affected
He did this, however, when he saw the corruption increasing in the limb with its suffering, because of the pain and the scorching: and he cut off the corruption at the junction, and it healed
And when some time had passed, the same corruption happened to him in the nail of his middle finger of his hand
He came to me, and I attempted to restore the superfluousness with what I found on the hand from the physicians after the purification of his body: and the superfluousness was not recovered, and it began to advance into another finger: until the corruption reached the hand
He called me to amputate his hand: and I did not do it, hoping for the recovery of the superfluousness: and I was also afraid of making an incision in his hand which might cause his death Since the man was very strong on the case.
When he had recovered from me, he returned to his home: and he came to me again because he had been hurt, and he had broken his whole hand: and he was healed.
And I do not approve of this narration, except that it is of use in this case: and that it has a signification which is to be known, and according to how it is done.
About the care of bones, and the quality of blistering with physicians.
When a swelling occurs in some limb by a fracture, and the space of the swelling is prolonged until the collection of pus has been made: then it is broken open, or pierced, and the pus which is in it is ejected, and that which remains is like a wound: and the skin which is over it is like a membrane which has been thinned out: and it does not reach its ultimate corruption, neither does it reach the bone, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it is called a Sinus, and is not called a Fistula, except when the space of the swelling is prolonged until it causes corruption in some part of the limb, then it is called a Fistula, or swelling
And its care is that you cut off the whole skin as it returns: and especially when it is thinned out, and is made like a membrane: and trust that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption
If, however, you hope that the skin will adhere, and that this will not be the last consequence of the corruption: and if there is thickness in the skin from the flesh, then care for it with blistering: and consider it as a Sinus
Then if it is great, and the pus which comes out of it is foetid of odor: then blister it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and alum, equal parts, mixed together: and apply them over a fire, until the medicine boils: and then bring in the fat of bees
Then take from this what you need: dissolve it with water and honey, and administer it with vinegar: and bind up its orifice, and give the medicine for two hours.
Then extract it with expression: do this for several days until the sinus becomes softened, and the stench is gone.</start_of_turn>
And when it is administered with water of cinnamon, when it is not present in this medicine: then take cinnamon of wood or of the ilex tree: and sprinkle it over water.</start_of_turn> Then rest it, and administer it with vinegar, until you are confident that the sinus is softened.</start_of_turn>
If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, neither vinegar of cinnamon, then administer it with water and honey, to which something of ground mastic has been added.</start_of_turn Or administer it with honey and wine mixed together, because of the property of honey to soften and loosen, and the wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.</start_of_turn
When you have done this several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has passed away: then administer it with that which makes the flesh grow in it.</start_of_turn
And it is good to take from pounded gypsum: and dissolve it with rose water and wine of vinegar: or administer it with some medicine, and anoint with others, whose properties are written in the treatise on unguents.</start_of_turn
If the orifice of the sinus is narrow, in which the canula of the syringe will not pass: then widen it with a small piece of iron: or put in the cavity a piece of lint soaked in Egyptian unguent, or in balsamic ointment, until it is widened.</start_of_turn
Likewise, if the opening is large, then gather its lips together with sutures: and discharge from it the amount that enters without adding anything.
If pus flows from the opening, elevate it upwards: then dry it in the lower part which is in the same place, so that it flows downwards: for pus, when it is contained in depth, hinders the generation of flesh in it.
If it is not possible to dry the cavity downwards, then attempt to prepare the limb by facilitating the flow of pus outwards with the preparation which is to be made. Attempt to retain nothing of the pus in it: and take consolidating medicines which are placed over the sign, suitable for this purpose. And extend them over the edge of the wound And let the size of the wound be such as to allow communication of the entire cavity. Then cut with scissors directly at the opening of the cavity, widening the opening of the cavity slightly. Then stretch out from soft bands over the wound, according to the size of the opening: and place it over it in a distant position from the opening of the cavity, so as to facilitate the discharge of pus from it: and do not tighten the dressing too much, except after a few days or until one has healed
He who is over the opening of the cavity should move in every hour, so that it may be discharged from what is aggregated in it from the pus: and you know that what comes out of it is much, or little, or digested, or undigested
And when you have done this again, consider the place of the cavity itself, whether it feels pain in it, or whether there is no pain in it, or whether there is swelling in it, or whether there is no swelling in it
When the remedy has been rendered as aforesaid, and you see that the material issuing from the sinus opening has ceased, then you know that the sinus is adhered or is approaching adhesion: then you must remove it either on the first day or on the third day. And when you have removed the abscess, then you must change the dressing and renew the unguentum.
When, however, the material issues from the sinus for a long space with a fine discharge, you must not despair of adhesion, for its healing approaches, because there are people who are slow to generate flesh in their wounds, and others who act contrariwise to this.
When, however, the material issues from the sinus after many days in undigested pus, then you know that the sinus is not adhered
When, however, the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its condition is prolonged: then physicians must join in the excision of remedies, for they make the remedies both humidy and dry: like the unguentum of aloe, which, when added in excess, has a superabundance of addition of alum.
And from the last of all, when it is cured, it is necessary to take the unguentum of aloe and dissolve it with rose water, and apply it over the old wound equal in quantity to the substance itself
Then apply it with this, and use it on it.
And it does the same thing to this, when it is not present with the unguentum of aloe, honey, when you dissolve it, until it is digested, and use it with this. Or take myrrh, and aloe, and olibanum: all of them together, and grind them up on honey while it is over the fire. Then apply on it a layer of the dressing, and bind it over the sinus: and line with the honey which you have boiled until it is digested: and sprinkle over it the powdered species, and put on the dressing again, and bind it over it.
When it is administered in that noble ointment, long aristolochia, lily roots of heaven, and lily flower, and barley herb, and centaurea. When it is administered with those simple substances, either singly or together, and the unguents themselves: and powdered cinnamon over honey as I have mentioned before, and use that.
If, however, the condition of the sinus persists and does not recover with this treatment: then you know that there is corruption in its depths: or that it makes an imprint in the bones, or in the other hard parts, or ligaments: then treat the fistula according to what has been said before.
Concerning the treatment of fistula and nail fracture, and the addition of incision of the finger and section.
Panaritis is a swelling that arises under the nail of the thumb or finger, or perhaps in the other fingers.
When it persists, and neglect of its treatment makes it swell, or when the swelling becomes inflamed, pus is emitted, until the root of the nail is corroded: and perhaps the whole nail is broken, and perhaps the corruption extends to the bone, whereupon there is a foul odor: and the finger becomes swollen, and its color becomes dark
When you treat it with what we have said before, and the cure does not take effect: then it is necessary to cut off the entire superfluous part that remains of the nail with a knife Then cauterize the nail afterwards. The cautery must be hot.</start_of_turn>
If indeed the bone is sound, and the nail is also sound, and the soft parts of the nail are pressing against the meat inwards, and begin to pierce it: then it is necessary to place a thin radium under the angle of the nail that is piercing the meat, and push the nail upwards: and cut the meat easily, and place over it what remains of the meat from the burnings, corrosive, until it is all removed Then care for it until it heals.
If, however, corruption has set in the bone, then it is necessary to cut off the bone and extract it: for it will not heal while corruption remains in it.
If you see corrosion and corruption spreading in a finger, then cut it at one joint, as has been previously mentioned concerning its reminder Then care for it until it heals.
If, however, there should occur attrition or percussion of the nail, and there is pain in this: then it is necessary to bleed the diseased part in the first instance. Then dry the nail with a sharp spatula from above downwards to the end.
And guard, that the cutting does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for thereby you will cause increased pain and swelling of the flesh itself.
Then care for the place with that which sits there which alleviates the pain.
A finger which has been added which is born in the hands of men, is perhaps all flesh: and perhaps in some of them there are bones, and perhaps in that there is a nail: and some of them are born from the root of the joint, or is the nature of it in some joint of the finger He who is born in some joint of the finger does not move: and he who is born near the articulation of the finger, perhaps moves
He who is made of flesh is easily cut That is, as you would cut it at the root with a broad spatula
As for that one whose nature is in the root of the joint, the care for it is difficult Abstain therefore from incision of it.
Abstain therefore from incision of it. Abstain therefore from incision of it. Abstain therefore from incision of it
Abstain therefore from incision of it
Abstain therefore from incision of it Abstain therefore from incision of it
Abstain therefore from incision of it

Abstain therefore from incision of it Abstain therefore from incision of it Then string the limb of the sickly person from the upper part of his hip down to the lower part of his knee with an outturn. Then dry one place, or two, or three wide sections
Then elevate, that is, draw out blood from the lower part of the leg up to above, and from above bring down as bloodletting for the sick person at first Then dry the wound downwards: until blood has drained out as much as the amount you wish, and as much as the sickness can tolerate
Then bind it: and command him to abstain from foods that generate black bile: and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and it is useful for the sick person.
The elevation of it is like this. The limb of the sickly person, if there are many hairs in it. Then immerse it in a bath: or bandage it in his leg with warm water, until it turns red, and swell the veins: or perform an exercise forcibly, if there is no bath for him, until the limb is warmed up
Then dry the skin in the direct line of the vein section: or at the last of it near the knee, or in the lower part of it near the heel.
Then open the skin with needles, and scrape the vein from every side, until it appears sensible: and it is at the appearance of it that the blood turns from red to black decreases. When it has gone out of the skin, the blood is like white thread
Then put under it radium, until when it is raised and comes out of the skin: suspend the blood with a cautery, soft
Then dry the other section near that one by three fingers. Then scrub the skin from the upper part of the nail downwards until it appears clean.</start_of_turn> Then raise the limb like you did with the radix, and suspend it with another finger as you did at first.</start_of_turn>
Then dry the other section, or the sections more, if you wish.</start_of_turn Then raise it up, and cut the last section at the heel.</start_of_turn
Then withdraw the limb up to the section which is above the limb.</start_of_turn
Do this until you have withdrawn the limb from the upper section, or from the higher sections altogether. Then cut the limb.</start_of_turn
If, however, it does not obey you to withdraw and elevate: then introduce the needle with a strong thread twice, and bind the limb, and withdraw it: or introduce it under that radix: and twist your hand towards all parts until it comes out.</start_of_turn Take heed, lest you cut through.</start_of_turn> For if you cut through, it becomes difficult to elevate the limb afterwards, and it enters through that wound.</start_of_turn
When you have therefore withdrawn the limb entirely: then place upon the wound a soaked bandage of wool or linen dipped in wine and rose oil, or oil: and care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn
If the vein is contracted, having a twist which has a loop towards the parts, and is not as we said according to the rule: then you must find upon the limb towards all parts the loop of the twist itself.
Then suspend the thread with the hooks until the vessel has healed completely: and take care at the section above the vessel that you do not cut through it, or damage it: for it is difficult to raise or extract the vessel afterwards. Therefore be prudent.
The nature of the wound that will restore life to the vessel.
The shape of the closed wound
It is not like the rest of wounds, neither acute at the edges, as to cut through it: but rather gross and flexible, for if it were slight, it would tear the vessel by its own softness: indeed, it should be somewhat thick.</start_of_turn>
On the extraction of the leg vein.</start_of_turn>
This vein is generated in the calves in warm regions, like Alizegi, and in Arabia, and in dry and warm regions, few in number, for in them no herb or tree grows.</start_of_turn
And perhaps it is also generated in other parts of the body besides the calves.</start_of_turn
And its generation is from the putrefaction which happens under the skin, like that which occurs within serpents and worms, and worms which are generated between the skin and the flesh.</start_of_turn
And the sign of the commencement of this event is inflammation in the calf.</start_of_turn Then the place is to be dried.</start_of_turn Then the vein is to be extracted from the place of drying, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.</start_of_turn
When the swelling appears from that extremity, then it is necessary that you cover over the leaden weight, whose weight is from a drachma to two drachmas and a nodus, and let go of the suspended lead from the limb.
When the swelling appears from that extremity outwards, cover it in lead and tie a knot in it.</start_of_turn> If it prolongs for a long time, then cut away part of it, and cover the remainder.</start_of_turn> Do not cut through the root before the whole thing has gone out.</start_of_turn For if you cut through it, it contracts, and enters the flesh: and causes swelling to happen, and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.</start_of_turn>
Therefore it is necessary to draw out slowly and gradually, until it comes out entirely from its root: and nothing of it remains in the body: for in this way it goes out through the vein in some people which is as long as five palms and ten fingers.</start_of_turn> And I have seen it where it has come out whole from twenty palms.</start_of_turn>
If, however, it occurs to you at the hour of your treatment: then introduce radium into the cavity of its bone, and perforate the bone with a hole as long as the body, until the whole of that which is in it is evacuated: and administer the treatment of the place with medicines for a few days.</start_of_turn Then take care of the aftercare of the wound.</start_of_turn
And this vein often has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and there are many outlets from every orifice, and they all go out.</start_of_turn
Care for it herself, as we said before, and with what has been promised.
Care for it itself, as we said before, and with what has been promised.
Care for it itself, as we said before, and with what has been promised
Care for it itself, as we said before, and with what has been promised.

Care for it itself, as we said before, and with what has been promised
Care for it itself, as we said before, and with what has been promised
Care for it itself, as we said before, and with what has been promised Then dry over it and extract it.
It is necessary that the patient be cleansed and purified with lukewarm water, with physicians extracting harmful humors from the body.
And take care that he be guarded against foods that generate putrefaction.
About the cutting over an abscess Nakir.
This ailment is called in our land Nakir: and it is a pain which occurs in some limb: then it changes from limb to limb
And I myself have seen it happen, as I have told you I was called to a woman who was sick in some house. And I saw her arm and I found swelling in the armpit of the arm
And after an hour had passed I saw another swelling rise up like a worm, going up to the shoulder of her more quickly than is possible: like silver that is running from one place to another
The pain therefore departed from that place and was fixed in the shoulder
Then after an hour it ran through the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm
And she told me that it returned throughout her whole body, as I saw
I am amazed at the speed of its change from limb to limb And I myself had never seen such an ailment before like this, in this way But I have heard of many people who suffer from this pain which changes from limb to limb: and I have never seen it with my own eyes like I saw it in this woman
I do not think that is the case, except insofar as a woman has been among those from whom the stones have been detected in the belly: from this therefore it appears that the sense of smell has been transposed.
It is necessary that they do not appear according to this ratio in those who are delicate and have moist bodies, and in whom the veins are hidden
When therefore you see that the patient feels pain in that place, and that the wound appears to him: then if it is seen by the eye, as we have said, then grasp above and below that which is quicker: and dry above that, until the enclosed moisture is driven out: and cauterize the place.</start_of_turn>
If however you do not see it with your eyes: then care for it with the exclusion of the body, and with that which expels the moisture, and carmine it with unguents like fennel seeds and rue seeds, and the like.</start_of_turn>
(The text continues with instructions on extracting stones from the body.)</start_of_turn>
Stones are diverse according to their species and according to the place from which they are expelled from the body.</start_of_turn>
Their diversity is such: for some of them have large teeth and few: others are concave and others are convex.</start_of_turn And there are those which have three angles.</start_of_turn And those which have tongues.</start_of_turn And those which are star-shaped.</start_of_turn
Those which are expelled from the limbs are according to two modes.</start_of_turn All members of the body are composed of primary members which are hollow, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar structures. When any part of these members falls into any other part of the body, and signs of death appear, then it is necessary to remove that arrow from there, for death follows the wound in whatever position it is, in many circumstances And when no such signs of illness appear, and the arrow is not deeply embedded, then extract it, and care for the wound
From the signs of the brain when it is struck by an arrow, and the bone is pierced, and blood comes out from above the brain, it is because the following things happen from that: vomiting, convulsions, dizziness, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasm, and confusion of the mind, and cholera. And perhaps blood comes out of the nose or ears. And perhaps speech is stammered, and the voice is destroyed And there comes out from the wound a white moisture like putty And there comes out from it like the moisture of meat
If any of these signs appear, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out on its own.
The signs of an arrow which has fallen into the heart are: that it is close to the left breast: and that it feels as though it is fixed in something hard, not in something soft. And perhaps the arrow is moving like the pulse: and blood runs out of the wound black. And following that, there is cold at the extremity, cold sweat, and faintness. You know therefore that death approaches with uncertain delay.
And the sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung, is the outflow of bloody foam from the wound: and the after-effects which follow the wound, subside, and change the colour of the patient. And great, high-flying spirit departs: and seeks the attraction of cold air.
If the arrow falls into the chest, which is in the belly: then it is near the flanks: and there is great sighing with pain, with breath coming in short gasps, and all the limbs of the arms are moved
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps it comes out of the wound from undigested food
And if the arrow falls into the belly, and remains there: something of stool comes out of the wound, or urine, or intestine which has been broken There is no hope in its cure, neither in the extraction of the arrow.
If the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain over the patient is stronger: then you know that it is deadly
The rest of the limbs, like the face, neck, chest, belly, and buttocks, and the fingers, and wrist, and elbow, and shoulder, and hip, and thigh, and leg, and similar parts of the limbs move according to various positions: when it does not find the arrow in the artery or nerve: and there is no venomous arrow
And I tell you that I have seen many such arrows, so that you may know about the cure for your case.
What is this, since the arrow of care has pierced the pupil of his eye in the root of his nose? Therefore I extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no mark remained in his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from his eye, which had pierced him in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was hidden, and I did not extract from it the point of the arrow which adhered to his wood: and it was a great arrow like those which the Turks make with lead in them, which have no ears
He was healed therefore, and no bad thing happened to his eye
And I extracted another arrow from the gut of a Christian.
And it was an Arab arrow, which is the kind that has ears And I found it between two ribs: and it was submerged in his gut I took great care of it until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from his head which had pierced him in his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
When thirty days had passed by and no change appeared in his condition concerning the arrow, we thought that he would not recover; and we took thought for the arrow and extracted it: and he was healed, and no bad thing happened to him.
And I saw a man whose arrow had pierced his back, and his wound was consolidated with a bandage on his wound And after seven years he went out of the arrow from the root of his thigh.
And the woman whose arrow had penetrated her body, and whose wound had been consolidated by a foreign body above it, and the arrow remained inside her: and no change occurred in its position from its original arrangement, and the woman did not suffer any discomfort from any of her natural operations.
And the man whose arrow had pierced his face, and whose wound had been consolidated, and remained in its place: and he experienced no great pain; similar to these many cases.
And I extracted the arrow from the King's nose, which had pierced him in the middle of his nose, and it had inclined towards the right side below: and the arrow was entirely hidden.
I was called to treat him after the arrow wound for three days. I found that the wound of the arrow was very strict and wide
I questioned him cautiously and he did not feel any pain: and even I could not find the puncture mark or any pain on his right side I hoped that the puncture was at the extremity of the arrow
I plastered the place with a soft and adhesive plaster, confident that the wound would heal and the mark of the arrow would disappear; and indeed no other sign of the arrow remained in that place.
I continued to plaster it over several days: and no accident occurred, and the wound consolidated meanwhile: and he felt the arrow inside his nose on the following day And he told me that
And he told me that I placed over it a sharp and corrosive medicine which I renewed every few days until it opened: and when I cautiously removed it, I found the tip of the arrow still adhering to the wood
Then did I add in the opening of the wound for the acute physician until it became evident to us the extremity of the arrow: and it passed over with it the space of time which is approximately four months.
When the wound had been enlarged, and it was possible for me to introduce instruments into it, and to sew it up, and it did not yield to extraction: then I did not cease to elaborate, and I devised above it with the skill of the engineers, until I had completed above it on a certain day with forceps which I had made with my own hands, according to what would result in the shape of the head in the end of the chapter, until I had extracted it. Then I restored the wound.
And the physicians say that the cartilage of the nose is not restored. I restored it therefore, and the wound was consolidated and healed with perfect health: and nothing whatever was noticed of it
And I tell you the quality of the extraction of some arrows: as you may learn from this and from what I have not said
For indeed the parts of this art and the distinctions of these matters are not comprehended by narration: neither is it comprehended by this book, nor by a prudent craftsman who compares few things with many: and with that which is present, with that which is absent: and he finds a new operation and a new instrument among the descent of all these matters when they happen.
I say therefore, that arrows do not go out of the parts in which they are fixed, except according to two ways. Except by attraction from the place from which it entered Or by turning back the other part
And that which comes out from where it entered, or the arrow proceeding in the flesh: it is attracted and comes out
If it does not yield to the outlet at the hour when it falls: then it is necessary that you discharge it for a few days, until the corruption of the flesh surrounding it has taken place: and thereby you will allay its attraction and its egressio.
If it hangs in bone, and does not yield to you at the outlet, then you must also discharge it for a few days: and do it again every day with its attraction and motion, until it comes out entirely
If it does not yield to you after days, then you must perform an incision all around the arrow in the very bone with fine silk, until the arrow is fully loosened Then draw out the arrow and extract it.
If however the arrow has vanished from its place in the body, and is hidden and concealed from sense: then inquire about it with care If you feel it, then draw out the arrow with some instruments that are suitable for its attraction.
If, however, you are unable to perform the procedure above due to the constriction of the wound or because of the length of the arrow in depth: and there is neither bone nor nerve nor fat there: then find above the wound until the wound is enlarged and the arrow can be extracted.
If there are any ligaments which hold the flesh fixed in the bone, then release the flesh from every side by all means, by any skill you are able, and the ingenuity which you can bring to bear, if you are unable to perform the evacuation of the flesh by fracture of the bone and rotation of the ear, until it becomes loose
And when you perform the extraction of the arrow, in whatever place it is, then use the twist of your hand with the forceps to all parts, until you make the wound discharge: and with the last slight tension, so that the arrow does not break, and that it is difficult for you to draw it, and for its own extraction.
If you are unable to perform it from one hour, then let it rest for a few days, until the things around it have decayed Then do it again: for it is in vain that you do it if it causes the flow of blood. Then administer what we have said from the treatment in its chapter: and guard your virtue from the incision of the vein, or nerve, or cord.
And administer all your skill in every way that you can in order to perform the extraction of the arrow: and let this be with ease, and tranquility, or slowly, and firmly, as I have told you
It is necessary that you do as you pull out the arrow, that the patient be in the same position as when the arrow was in him. Because of the great pain. If it is not possible for you to do this, then administer what is possible from the figures.
If it proceeds from the opposite side, or if anything proceeds from that towards the exterior: or it makes the extremity of the arrow bulge outwards by means of a sensation from the part of the skin which is close above, and it causes the juice to rise: dry therefore above that, and make a section according to the quantity which they take in that.
Then draw out the arrow: for itself makes the evacuation easy.
If however it remains in the bone, then turn your hand according to the roundness, until you press the arrow into the bone, and expand it for itself: then draw it out
And if not: leave it for a few days: then do it again, until it comes out naturally.
If the arrow-shaft is in that, then push it out with that (the hand).
If however the shaft has broken, and you wish to administer an impulse: then introduce an instrument with a concave surface into the cavity, so that the concavity of the instrument may touch the caudal part of the arrow: then push out the arrow with that.
If the arrow is concave, then push out the arrow with an instrument entering into itself. The arrow will go out by itself.
If the arrow is poisonous, then it is necessary to cut away the entire piece of flesh in which the poison is, if this is possible Then care for the arrow as it deserves which is suitable for it
If the arrow has fallen into the chest, or the belly, or the back, or the side: and it is close to that which you touch with your hand, and it is possible to cut above that: then cut above that, and burn away from the incision of the vein, or nerve, and draw out the arrow.
Then, if necessary, take a pulse, and care for it until it heals.
This is the form of forceps from which arrows are extracted.
The extremities are like the beak of a bird, which are made like iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not recoil
There are many kinds of forceps, large, small, medium, according to the quantity of the arrow, the thinness and breadth of the wound, and the constriction of the wound
The shape of the hooked handle
The shape of the blunt handle
This is the shape of the extremities like a radius, so that the entrance of it into the hooked arrow is alleviated, and is driven with it
On the phlebotomy of veins
The veins which are usually phlebotomized in the body are thirty in number
Of these, in the head there are sixty: two pulse veins, which are behind the ears, are called Herbae; two arteries which appear in two temporal regions; two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called Aspicientes; a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead; and a vein which is at the tip of the nose And two guide veins which are in the neck And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth And two veins which are in the lower lip. And these are the veins which are called Algecherich. And two veins which are under the tongue
For the veins which are phlebotomized in the arms, there are five veins in every arm.
One of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the side of the shoulder: and it names the great vein of the head And the Fusca And it is the Middle vein, and it is composed of the branch of the Basilic vein, and the branch of the Cephalic vein: and it names the great vein of the body And the Basilic, and it is placed on the domestic side: and it is also called the Titillicaris. And it names the great vein of the abdomen And the Brachial vein, and it is placed above the elbow: and it is that in which phlebotomy is done, and that which appears above the thumb with a visible swelling.
And the Palateal: and it is the vein which is between the ankle and the heel: and there are two branches to it.
And in the leg and in the foot there are three veins. One of them is which is under the curvature of the thumb from the side of the shoulder. And the second is the Saphenous: and its place is alongside the calcaneus from the domestic side And the Great Saphenous: and its place is alongside the calcaneus from the shoulder side
And on the other leg there are three veins like these
After the Aures, perform a phlebotomy of two veins.
After the Aures, perform a phlebotomy of two veins which are post Aures, for treatment of ancient cataracts, and migraine, and sapafi, and old head ulcer.
The quality of the phlebotomy is according to what is narrated. And it is that the head of the patient should be relaxed: and one should press the area of the two veins with a rough cloth with good friction Then let the patient tighten his neck with his hands, until two veins appear. And their places are post Aures in two depressed places of the head. Seek therefore easily with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, there is the sign with the imprint.
Then take the phlebotomy knife, which is called Incidens Then introduce it under the vein into the skin, until the phlebotomist reaches the bone. Then lift your hand with the vein and skin towards the upper parts, and cut the vein with the incision which is incidental And the length of the incision is the quantity of two joined fingers, or thereabouts: and let blood flow out as much as you wish
Then bind the patient with bands, and let go of the vein, until it is healed
And thus it is at the beginning of this book that the incisions and the cauterization of the veins are mentioned.</start_of_turn>
If, however, the arteries which are in two positions are bled, it is to an old headache: and the proximate swelling, and the constant vomiting: and the flow of sharp-pointed effusions towards the eyes.
The quality of bleeding is easy according to what I have said to thee. The patient must hold his head still for a long time until two veins appear to the sense of sight: and the pulse of them is to be shown under thy finger. Then, signs with encasement.
Then lift the skin over the vein upwards with thy index finger, and make the incision below, and elevate the vein upwards. And cut through it, like thou didst in two other veins: and cause the blood to flow according to the quantity which thou shalt need.
Then loosen the clotting of the patient, and place thy finger over the vein for an hour. Then place over it the cushion and the pillows, and bind it tightly above the constriction: and let it go, until it is healed
And afterwards came the recollection of these things, and their incision, and their extraction at the beginning of the book.
The bleeding of the front vein after the cephalic vein has been bled is useful for old facial ailments: and for a headache, and redness: and a wound.
The quality of bleeding of this is, according to what I have said to thee The patient must hold his head still with his hand, until the vein appears. Then take the instrument which is called Fossorium.
Place the prominent point which is at the head of the Fossorium over the opening, and pierce through it with the pin or with something else in the same way: and let the blood flow out according to the quantity you wish. Then close the perforation of the patient, and tie it off, until it is healed.
And when it is opened with a wide phlebotome. Indeed it does not suffice that the phlebotome be of acute extremity, like the other phlebotoms, but rather that it be of broad extremity And let the phlebotome be according to the passage of the bone: because the bone is close by: and perhaps in this the phlebotome will break when it is slight
The support of the two veins which are in the two lacrimal bones of the two eyes, is for the eye from scabies and redness: and for the swelling in the eye, and the pains of the face.
And the quality of the phlebotomy of these is, that it tighten the neck of the patient with wit Then the phlebotomy is easy: and you stand over his head
And let the phlebotomy be according to the passage to a small length, with a small phlebotome, broad rather than narrow, because there is no flesh in the place. If indeed the phlebotome is slight of extremity, perhaps it will break.
Then let the blood flow out as much as is necessary for you Place above the wound a compress, bind it once at night, and resolve it.
As for the veins of the nose, phlebotomy is useful for acute fever, excessive sweating, facial pain, such as migraine, and redness which occurs in the face: especially when it is longstanding.
The quality of the phlebotomy is that it tightens the neck of the patient. Then take the left hand of the patient and perform the phlebotomy with a slight curve, long: and hold it in the middle of the nose itself, between what distinguishes the nose following a straight line. For the vein does not appear to the sense there, and blood immediately flows out of it
It is necessary to take the last hand away from the phlebotomy at the same time: and make the blood flow away from you as you deem necessary Bind it once at night The wound itself will soon recover
For the phlebotomy of the Guidegian veins is useful for constriction of the throat, the inception of leprosy, melancholy, itching and ulcers, and corrosive diseases, that is, herpetiform eruptions of the skin
The quality of these phlebotomies is that they tighten the neck of the patient both under and above with a ligature: and let the artist sit above the head of the patient, and the patient should sit on a seat
Then draw out the vein to the length of the phlebotomy wide enough Then extract from the blood an amount suitable, or according to what you need for that. Then do likewise with another vein
Then suture the ligament and bind two veins with a middle clamp: so that the patient is not harmed And keep it quiet until morning. The wound will then heal.
Of the phlebotomy of veins according to Algeberich The veins of Algeberich are phlebotomized because they cause vomiting at the root of the tongue, corruption of the gums: and sores of the lips, and wounds in the nose, and in the surrounding area
And the quality of the phlebotomy of these veins is that you make the patient sit before you: and bind his neck with a cloth. Then pull down his lip, and look at two veins: one is on the right side of the lip, and the other on the left side of the lip: and their indication is by the blackening of both. And this is true: because around them are small veins, black Therefore make an incision on each of them as they happen to lie there
If however there is doubt to you, and you do not know which of them is which: then you must resort to the greater incision of both of them, and their manifestation
And do the same with the two veins that are in the upper lip: and most frequently this runs in custom with them: and make an incision of two veins which are in the lower lip
Of the phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue after the phlebotomy of the Cephalic veins The veins under the tongue are useful for phlebotomy: for it is the cephalic vein which is useful for the affections of the gut, and of the tongue, and of the mouth.
The quality of the phlebotomy which is useful is that the patient should sit between your hands facing the sun: and raise his tongue, and look under the tongue at one side a vein, and at the other side a vein: and the colour of both veins should incline towards blackness.
Phlebotomy is therefore useful on both sides: and take care, do not put your last hand in phlebotomy. For under these are arteries, and perhaps there will be a flow of blood from these arteries.
The three veins which are phlebotomized in the elbow are such that phlebotomy is usual in all men.
And phlebotomy of them is done in two ways. Either by pressing with the thumb alongside phlebotomy: or by lancing with oil to the point of blueness: or by cutting with a knife, and this is Alnesil. This is its form.
And there are wide and narrow species according to the width of the veins and the tension of them. The form of phlebotomy of the thumb is wide, like water And it is suitable for opening wide veins, full of blood, protruding, visible, large, and those which contain thick blood
And this phlebotomy is of smaller width and greater fineness
It is suitable for phlebotomy of slender veins which contain thin yellow blood.
However, those veins which are three in number which are called basilicae are suitable for phlebotomy. Because they draw blood from the swellings which are under the jaw and the throat, from that which follows the chest, and the belly: and it is suitable for the phlebotomist as well as for the patient, as it is above the risk of that there is an artery there If, therefore, it goes wrong, and there is an error in the puncture of the phlebotomy, the artery will be injured, and there will be a flow of blood Therefore it is necessary not to do phlebotomy with the phlebotomist who is puncturing: but rather to do it dry like Alnesil.
If it does not appear that the basilica is visible, then it is necessary to ask another one, or to ask for another branch of it: or to do the phlebotomy in another place, such as the forearm It is visible itself, and should be done dry with the phlebotomist like Anesil, as we have said.
If you wish to do phlebotomy of the same one, then it is necessary before the tightening of the arm, to touch the place, until you know the place of the pulse. Then sign over the place with the cautery, afterwards the arm, and dry the vein with a concave incision like the phlebotomist Anesil, as we have said And be careful not to touch the artery with the incision.
And when you go, when you tighten the ligature, the swelling in the place which you signed with the cautery, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: you must therefore stop doing it
If the blood spurts at the phlebotomy, like the urine of a child, and is thin and red: then you know that it is from an artery. Then do so promptly, and place your finger over the wide space, and then withdraw your finger.</start_of_turn> If the blood is shed (for it is often shed excessively), then grasp the arm and let go of it: and let the patient be aware of its motion: and be over his fear.</start_of_turn>
And do not move it for a few days, until it has healed.</start_of_turn
But if the blood does not shed, and you fear it: and there is no physician present at your moment, then cut the artery if you see it.</start_of_turn> For its extremities recoil, and the blood is shed.</start_of_turn
Or take a piece of cork from the socket of the thumb, and find the place: grasp a middle third, and bind it over the place of the tight nail, with ligature and threads until another day.</start_of_turn
Then if the blood sheds, that is good.</start_of_turn And if not: then care for it as before, remembering the location of the broken blood vessels and the flow of blood: and the cutting of the blood in various positions is not difficult because of the smallness of the wound and the possibility of ligating from the arm.</start_of_turn
The veins of the thumb, however, are of phlebotomy, because they carry blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: because they are composed of the branches of the basilica and the cephalic vein, as we said.</start_of_turn
And it is fitting for the phlebotomist to be above the fear of phlebotomy, for under it lies a nerve. If, therefore, he adds too deeply in the puncture of the phlebotomy and finds the nerve, there results in this a stupor, and the healing becomes difficult, and perhaps does not heal completely.</start_of_turn>
And this nerve is much frequented by sensation.</start_of_turn> If, however, it is hidden in some people, and is thin, and is not seen: then it is necessary that you should join phlebotomy with Alnesil, and divide the nerve with your skill.</start_of_turn>
And if there is one between two nerves, then find the one along its length.</start_of_turn
Of the nerve of the head.</start_of_turn> Phlebotomies of the nerve of the head are useful, for it draws blood from the head and supplies it to the eyes.</start_of_turn
And it is necessary in this nerve to do so alone, if you will, with a needle like that of olive oil, or like that of myrtle: for it is safer for all the veins, for there is neither artery nor nerve under it.</start_of_turn
But indeed it is fitting for you to join with the phlebotomy the laceration of the head, and to inquire about a softer place: and it does not harm it, if it is not found at the first percussion, as it returns above with subsequent phlebotomies.</start_of_turn
Perhaps indeed it is delayed in some people when it is not phlebotomized at the first percussion, but it does not harm them that.
On the usefulness of Phlebotomy, and precautions to be observed in its practice. The quality of Phlebotomy, and the accidents that arise from it, require consideration in their rectification.
Firstly, know that Phlebotomy is not to be employed except for the conservation of health, and for the preservation of life, and with caution against the hazards.
And that it should be performed only on the three veins that are in the elbow, namely the Cephalica, and the Fusca, and the Basilica. And that it should be performed at the beginning of spring after fasting, in summer, and autumn, and in winter after a meal, when there are signs of fullness
It should be performed on the first or third day after three hours have passed
Phlebotomy for ailments has no set time: but when it is convenient and necessary for this, in the night or day, and at every hour, and at every time.
And it should not be performed on children until they are at least fourteen years of age. Neither should it be performed on a pregnant woman except from the fourth month until the seventh Nor on the elderly who have passed their sixties years.
When anyone wishes to undergo Phlebotomy for whatever reason: it is necessary to loosen his bowels beforehand with a laxative, if there is much retained stool: so that they do not draw blood from the veins with the remnants of putrid feces adhering to the principal limbs
Neither should it be performed on a feverish patient, that is, one with nausea: nor on a drunkard, or one suffering from intoxication until these symptoms have passed from the body Neither the infirm nor the healthy suffer from hydropisi.
Neither the infirm nor the healthy suffer from hydropisi.

Neither the infirm nor the healthy suffer from hydropisi Neither the infirm nor the healthy suffer from hydropisi.
Then the phlebotomist deposits the needle. If therefore an opening is made from the vein of one, then that is good. And if not, then repeat the process with another vein nearby under that place or above it with a twist: if the place does not recover
When it has recovered, or if the patient vomits, then send him away on the first or second day: and do not tighten the ligamentum Perhaps for that reason the swelling will be withdrawn. Neither should a poultice be introduced
Then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
If the opening is small or blood runs slowly: and take care that blood does not escape from the vein in too great quantity: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same place according to the rule and add a little more to the operation
Do it with a twist, before the place has recovered: for in many people the place is already recovered at the time of the operation itself.
If therefore you see that the swelling has already gone, then do not repeat over it altogether, for it does not excuse you from doing something else And put something of the faeces of oil on it: because it will soothe the course of the blood. And it is better in this place than pure oil, and than the rest of the oils.
And do the same with the faeces of oil in all your phlebotomies, which you do on account of the running of the blood: and make them become like tyriaca alfarach and sagzenea, when you put one of them on the place.
Blood becomes finer and is resolved when it is thick.
When blood is thick, it becomes finer and is resolved
And it is necessary to do this after the blood has been let from the vein itself, with the addition of some of its complement, or from another vein.
If some blackness or redness remains in the place after a day or two, or if there is any swelling, do not be afraid of this: and if you are afraid, put over it some aloe or myrrh, or something from the juice of mint, that is, camphor or something like that.
And very often blood clots and swellings occur at the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Put your hand over the place, then if you feel softness under your compression, then that swelling is bad. Therefore, put over it something of what we have mentioned. For perhaps the blood will flow from that artery.
But make a plaster of it with something that has styptic properties, so that the place is closed And then care for the rest with the remaining treatment until it is healed
And it is necessary to draw out of every man from blood according to the quantity of his virtue And what appears from the color of the blood over the blood itself.
For if the blood is black, then send it away until it turns red: and in the same way if you find it thick, then send it away until it becomes fine: and in the same way if it is sharp, then send away its sharpness until it is gone
He who is full, strong, and in need of blood should extract one unit, so as to enlarge the vein, and let the phlebotomist be wide: and in him who is bilious, let it be the opposite of him.
He must extract in veins and the opening must be narrow: and it is better that the phlebotomy be transverse, not pointed
This is the safe method of phlebotomy, from the flow of blood, from nerves: and is more laudable and safer than phlebotomy through breadth and length.
And to whom it has happened to faint during phlebotomy, it is necessary that before phlebotomy he be given a spoonful of honeyed water or dry toast, if he is heated: and extract from him from the blood in three or four veins.
And if the complexion is cold, then take before phlebotomy a spoonful of bread infused with honey, or in scented honey, or in scented syrup.
And if there is fainting during phlebotomy, and the cause of it is excessive bleeding: then it is necessary that he take in the pot a little meat broth and a mild aromatic syrup: and let it be flavored with fennel and mint, and let the patient lie down with these things: and let us do all that we have said in the chapter on fainting from evacuation
But if he wants to evacuate his arm and solve his blood quickly: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is because of much evacuation, and whose temperament is bilious, to solve the blood gradually in the quantity of his temperament in continuous days.
He who wants to evacuate his arm and solve his blood quickly, and whose body is strong: let him do this after seven hours, or nine from his first phlebotomy
Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs downwards: it must be done on the second or third day.
Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs downwards: it must be done on the second or third day. Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs downwards: it must be done on the second or third day.

And what is the quality of phlebotomy, that it may introduce the patient's hand into warm water, until the wound is red, and the joint appears to swell outwards.
Then it is bound over itself with a bandage of moderate constriction. Then phlebotomy is performed in a transverse direction gradually, not laterally, neither in length: and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be as near to the wrist as possible
If the blood is prohibited from escaping, then repeat the hand into the warm water, and let the blood run in the water, until you achieve your purpose
But if you are in the summer days, then you are excused from the repetition of the hand in the warm water. And above all, the course of the blood in the warm water is set in the winter time.
And the phlebotomy of this joint is more safe than all the others, because there is no pulsating vein or nerve under it.
Phlebotomy of the right hand is useful for the treatment of liver ailments.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is that you bind the wrist with a bandage, or your hand itself, after you have introduced the hand into the warm water, until the joint swells up and the sense of coldness appears. Then phlebotomy is performed by a transverse cut And if you cut the vein entirely, it will not cause it any harm in any way.
And take care not to faint from the phlebotomy Under this, the nerves of the fingers are stripped of flesh.
Then again, move the hand to the warm water, and let the blood flow out into it. If you do not move the hand into the warm water, the blood will coagulate in the mouth of the [vein], and will be prohibited from running.
When you have drawn out the quantity of blood necessary, then place upon the vein oil and salt: that it does not solidify too quickly.
It is also necessary to do this with every tight limb.
The true cause of this phlebotomy is the spleen: and in the same way do it in this phlebotomy as in the second [phlebotomy] equally.
The veins of the phlebotomy are useful for ailments which are in the lower parts of the body, such as abdominal ailments, retention of menstrual blood, kidney disease, ulcers of the groin and ancient buttocks, and similar ailments.
The quality of this phlebotomy is that it allows the sick limb to be introduced into the warm water: and let there be done over it friction, until the veins burst: and ligate above the junction of the limb with ligatures The veins are at the heel, appearing outside the thumb: and they are torn out from it in front of the foot from the ankle bone downwards
The phlebotomy is therefore better to be done in a larger limb, or at the ankle in its collection: because this is better and safer
If you make the phlebotomy on the face of the foot, then take care of the nerves which are under it over the face of the foot.
And make the phlebotomy from the transverse position, like the surgeon who wishes: and let the phlebotomy be as Nesil
If blood flow is prohibited, then repeat the foot in warm water: and hold back the flow of blood in the vessel until it is evacuated.
If the vein has slipped from the first incision, then repeat the incision above the former, for the place is safe, and not liable to cause harm, even if you chance to cause damage to nerves, as we have said
And in like manner with the other foot's vein.
The veins of the sciatic nerve are situated at the heel on the outer side of the ankle bone as we have said
The cause of pain in the ankle is a blood clot
The quality of the incision is that it should be made with a soft sponge and should be rapid: and bind the limb from the ankle up to the heel with a fine long strip, so that nothing is visible except for that
When it appears, then the incision of the vessel is to be repeated according to whatever means is possible, or according to the passage of the vessel: and it is better to cut through the vessel by incision or by section The place of the vessel is safer, and it is usually hidden in many people.
The place of the vessel is safer, and it is usually hidden in many people. If you do not find it and it does not appear to the senses at all: then repeat the incision of some branch of the vessel which appears in the heel and is opposite the auricle: and cause the blood to flow out in the quantity that you desire
Then loosen the binding, and place over the site of the incision the skin, and bind the place. It heals quickly.
On wound treatment, and the quality of its material.
Wounds are made from bones, air, and pus.
And wound treatment is done in two ways. By scraping and bleeding extraction: or without scraping.
And this kind of wound treatment that is without scraping is done in two ways Or with heat Or without heat
And those wound treatments which are administered with scraping and bleeding extraction are fourteen in number throughout the body Of which one is the treatment of the Alnocrati wound, and it is the last of the head: and the Alkehel, and it is the middle of the neck: and the wound treatment of the Alhagdahim, and there are two layers of the neck from two parts together: and the wound treatment of the menti is under the mandible in the lower part of the mouth: and the wound treatment of the two spatulas: and the wound treatment of the Alachosos over the end of the tail: and the wound treatment of the two focilia, and there are two of the biceps: and the wound treatment of the two cubits: and the wound treatment of the two heels.
And wound treatment does not pull out blood from small veins scattered throughout the flesh, and because of this it does not cause a loss of blood, as is the case with phlebotomy Neither is it necessary to administer wound treatment with heat, or without heat in any ailment which comes from excessive swelling, until the whole body is evacuated
Which if necessity compels us to do for wound treatment on account of an ailment, or because of custom, we administer it at every hour in the beginning of the month, at the end of the month, and in the middle of the month, and at any other time as needed
What is this, since it is from men that when it multiplies in their blood, until it requires extraction from them by means of vomiting, it finds in their head its greatest weight and burden?
And from this is that it brings about swelling and redness in their face, head, and neck. And from this is that it brings about itching in their face, and forehead, and darkness, and blindness in their eyes.
And from this is that it severs the seat of their vomiting. And from this is that their laughter multiplies. And from this is that it brings about the taste of blood in their mouth: either the tongue is swollen and expels blood. And from this is that their sleep multiplies And from this is that they urinate in their sleep blood and redness, and blood clots, and wounds, which are like these.
When therefore we see any of these things, and it is in the third middle of the month: we command vomiting to be performed immediately, after two or three hours have passed
The vomiting of the night is thus: because it itself brings about a weight in the head, and what flows down to the eyes. It is therefore necessary, that after vomiting of the whole body
These are like phlebotomies of the head
It is not lawful to use these things in those who are cold in complexion, or in whom there is catarrus For it brings about a great danger.
Neither is it proper that these should be used in the case of old men, in whom cold fevers prevail in the head.
Whoever is too assiduous above his limits will generate for himself an aversion.
And therefore it is necessary, that the surgeon should take hold of the wind, that he should place his hand with the windward side downwards, fearing lest an aversion should be generated thereby
Wind or alcohol is the place of the incision of the veins of the groin and of the veins of the belly, and because of this it confers swelling, constriction of the breath, and loss of strength, and cough, and distension of the belly
It is necessary to urge the alcohol of the wind slightly downwards, for if it is placed downwards, it generates stiffness in the heart and the stomach
The wind or alcohol, when applied too vigorously, causes pain in the head, vomiting, headaches, perforation, and toothache: and it is the place of the incision of the veins of the belly.
And it is necessary that the surgeon take hold of the wind, that he should not place his hand with the incision: that he may not cut the artery and cause the flow of blood to be obstructed.
The alcohol of the wind under the chin causes swelling in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar diseases which are in the mouth: and it is the place of the incision of the veins which are in the two lips.
The alcohol of the wind causes spitting, which is from reflection and heat.
The alcohol of the wind inside the two cavities of the cheeks causes the drawing out of the veins of the groin, of the veins of the belly, and of the veins of the head: for it attracts blood from all these small veins which are in the flesh: and it attracts these small veins from other large veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
It is necessary, therefore, that the surgeon take heed, not to advance too far in the incisions: for in such a place the flesh is stripped bare, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
The winds of the intestines cause swelling over the ulcers of the rectum, and lower ulcers.
It is necessary, therefore, that the surgeon take heed, so that the incisions be large and open to the air: for in such a place the veins are liable to be broken by excessive suction.
The veins of the limbs grow thin from diminished circulation: for they draw blood from all over the body, and cause ancient pains in the buttocks, thighs, and calves: they cause menstruation, and bring about swelling, and pain: and are in the place of two saphenous veins, and the marrow bones.
Indeed, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting in many people.
The marrow bones are very near to the veins of the limbs.
The position of the veins is such that you should apply the incision to the first wound and moderate the suction: and do not prolong the position of the incision, but place it easily and remove it easily, so that the humors may rise to their proper place: and do not desist from this process until the area is red and swollen, and the blood appears red: then indeed you may perform the incision, and slowly resume the suction.</start_of_turn> Consider also the position of the body.
For one who has little flesh and few hairs, it is necessary to make the incision once, not twice: so as not to tear the place.</start_of_turn>
And advise the Wind-Surgeon, that he increase the scarification, and make it shallow: and temper the suction to facilitate, and speed, and the movement of the instrument.
If there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary, that he make the incisions twice In the first incision he opens a small opening for the evacuation of blood, and washes it: and in the second incision he makes an exquisite extraction of the thick blood
If the blood is dark green, then make a third incision: in order to obtain the utmost
Finally, when we wish to extract the blood slowly, or little by little, sufficeth us one incision. When we wish to extract a great quantity of blood, we make many incisions.
And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it is necessary, that he make a deep incision: and the equal endpoint of the incision is the depth of the skin.
What must be administered from the oils at the position of the Wind-Surgeon, and what is the cause of the wind-surgeon?
In that which the skin is thick, hard, rough, and has close pores, it is necessary that you anoint the area of the Wind-Surgeon with open, soothing, dissolving oils: if it is in summer, such as almond oil, or oil of violets, or sweet fennel oil, or cucumber seed oil
And if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or camomilla oil, or salve: and the like.
If there is excessive coldness, the oil must be amaranth oil, or balsam oil or white oil, or almond oil: and the like.
If the belly is full of wind, hold meat: then it is necessary to prevent the bile from going out, and it is necessary to wash the places of the winds after the letting of wind with rose-water, or with cold water, or with salt water, or with cucumber water, or with rainwater: and the like.
If the blood of a person is full of moisture, wash the winds after letting with vinegar, or with myrtle water, or with alum: and the like.
If there are many thick humours in the blood, wash the winds after letting with old wine, or with rue water, or with fennel decoction, or chamomile: and like these things.
It is necessary to bathe in a bath, or in a bathhouse, immediately after the letting of the wind, and it is necessary to take something for an hour, or two hours, after coming out of the bath.
And it is not necessary for anyone to sleep after the letting of the wind.
What is it that is necessary to do in order to regulate the wind, or to do phlebotomy before the letting of the wind?
And after this it is necessary to consider: then if the wind is choleric, or if phlebotomy is necessary, and if there is an excess of heat in the blood: then it is necessary to take something cooling, such as pomegranate seed: and also barley with vinegar and lettuce, and chicory, and mugwort: and like these things.
And put the meat on a low diet, and eat coarse bread, and feed the boiled things with fennel: and like these things.
And as for one who has a cold complexion, it is necessary to take in a drink of honey syrup, or of aloes, or of acacia honey: and drink a moderate wine, which is between new and old: and it is recommended to eat little food And place its meat on the cocks, and dogs: and birds, that is, sparrows: and the meat of pigeons.
And it is necessary that the liquid of the diet on the day of vomiting and bleeding should be more than the food: and it is necessary that it be given in a liquid in which some man has eaten in the hours of twilight or before vomiting, or medicine of the muscle, that is, muskroot, or alehoof before vomiting, or after: in order to comfort the principal members and to temper the blood. And it is not permitted to take warm food in the liquid.
Of Vomiting without Incision. But those vomiting which are without incision are those which arise from the excess of food in the upper parts of the body, and the spleen, and the foot, and over the belly, the navel, and the region of the kidneys, and the piece of the intestine of the appendix: because these members do not suffer incision over themselves
And it is not necessary to seek for its ease, except for an attack from a member of the blood to a member: as we place Vomiting on the nipples in the flux of blood from the veins. And we must take care that the cold of the vomiting does not injure the adjacent member: as we place vomiting on the belly and the navel For indeed it dilates the member, and warms it, and removes the pain thereby, because it resolves the said vomiting.
It is also placed over the kidneys, when it happens in the eating of cheese, or bread For its own attraction is perhaps opening the vomiting, or driving out the stone from its place.
And in the same way it does when it is placed over the spleen and the upper part of the stomach in the vomiting of both of them.
These winds are administered with a small incision. And sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered with warm water in pleuritic ailments: and this is when the Wind is to be applied, and be great, only warm water alone, or water in which certain herbs have been boiled together.</start_of_turn>
The form of Wind administered with fire.</start_of_turn>
The breadth of its opening is two fingers wide, according as we form it: and the quantity of it in depth is half a palm, and its breadth is in the middle of it, a small hole, according to the quantity of the needle which is to be inserted: it is made of air, or citrine, thick at the edges, soft, even, rough. Let it not harm the limb in its position over itself: and there shall be in its middle a transverse bar of iron or steel, on which is set the candle with fire.</start_of_turn
And thus is this wind made great, greater than we have narrated, and somewhat less than that, according to the ailments and the age of the patient who uses it.</start_of_turn
The wind of children is great, and those of the extenuates are other than those of men, and of the gross.</start_of_turn
The quality of placing this wind with fire upon the limb is that you incline the wick with fire from the center outwards, or put a candle already alight from pitch: and put it upon the middle of the transverse bar which is in the middle of the wind, so that the fire is surrounded below the lower part of the wind, so that it does not burn the patient.</start_of_turn
Then place it upon the limb: and the finger rests upon the hole which I mentioned, until we have finished with the wind: when we have finished, we remove the finger, and the vapor escapes from that hole, and the wind is at rest immediately.</start_of_turn
Then give the purgative according to its manner, and repeat if it does not work.
In cases of intestinal obstruction due to wind, which is administered with water, there is neither a transverse nor a circular bougie: it is not administered unless the abdomen is filled with water, and is placed over the limb only.
This is its form.
The larger the dose of this purgative, the more water it will absorb
On the suspension of blood-sugar.
Blood-sugars are not administered in multiple places, except in those places where the position of the intestines is not possible due to their density, such as the lip and the tongue, and things of a similar nature Or in a limb stripped of flesh, such as the finger and the nose, and things of a similar nature
The quality of the purgative is: that it be made from blood-sugars which are in sweet water, freed from putrefactions
Then they are given every day and night in sweet water, until the patient is relieved of hunger, and nothing remains in their belly Then let the body be evacuated at first with a phlebotomy, and with purges. Then strip the limb of the patient, until it turns red Then place over itself.
When they have been administered, and have gone down, and the place has been sucked with the purge, then it is possible to suck the place with the vomit: and if not, then evacuate the place with vinegar Then, when there is much water, and the wound is raw, and has burst open.
When the flow of blood persists after a burst blood vessel, and there is oozing: then pour a piece of linen cloth into cold water, and place it over the wound, until the oozing stops.
When there is bleeding profusely, then sprinkle powdered alum or gall, and similar things like sponges from the sponges: until the bleeding stops.
Or place over the wound cloths of linen which have been scraped: and let them go, until the cloth sticks to the place, for the blood will stop bleeding.
And it is necessary, if possible, to change the dressing of the blood vessel repeatedly.
If the bleeding is forbidden from being suspended, then the place is washed out with blood which has recently escaped Or hold pressure in the place, until something comes out of the blood Then put on [pressure], for when they feel something coming out of the blood, they adhere immediately.
When therefore they wish to fall asleep, sprinkle upon them something from aloe which has been pounded, or salt, or ashes: and they will fall asleep immediately.
This chapter is also very useful in the art of Medicine, and is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of bones.</start_of_turn
Hear ye, sons of learning! For they that handle this book of the art of healing and of wondrous remedies, who have never once perused the works of the ancients, neither learned a single letter from them.
And thus it is that this method is hidden from our land's sciences I have learned nothing good from it in this matter, and I am not skilled in it except in so far as I have learned from the great books of the ancients, and from their wisdom.
Therefore I have clung to experience and the length of my life.
I have set down for you in this chapter all the science which I have learned: and that which has passed my experience, after I had abridged it for you, and I have cast off that which was not essential, and have abridged that which remained, and have brought it to a close. And I have devised many forms of instruments which are used in this work, with the addition of their declension, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
**Chapter II.**
It is necessary, as we have said in the prologue to this chapter, to recall the main points and chapters which are to be considered in the first place by the artisan in his progress: that is to say, those who are learned and those who are prompt, should know, or learn, or add to this noble art, or others from you.
I say then, when any fracture, dislocation, twisting, or falling occurs: then it is necessary immediately to draw blood from him, and to bind up the wound, or both together: if nothing else hinders, or is lacking, such as weakness of spirit: or that the patient is young or old and decrepit: or that the time is urgent, either because of the heat or the cold.
Then he shall be satisfied with his food, with cold herbs, and with birds’ flesh, and with blood-vessels: and he shall abstain from strong drink, and from fatty meats, and shall restore himself from food and from all food which fills the veins. When he is secure from the heat of the after-flux, and does not fear effusion of the matter to the limb: then the patient may return to his ordinary regimen as soon as he is accustomed to it.
When the bone is begun to be restored, then it is necessary, that the patient be nourished with nourishing and bulky food, such as barley bread boiled with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and entrails of sheep, and fish, and fresh eggs: and strong drink, and things similar to these With this regimen the coagulation of the fracture is quicker and better
And thou knowest, that bones which are broken when they are in the joints which are in the prime of life, and are decrepit, are not able to continue and consolidate according to their natural tendency always, because of the drying up of the members: and they consolidate and continue only as much as the parts which are in the end of softness, as for example bones of the limbs of new-born children.
But nature annexes to the broken bone from every side something like glue, which has thickness, by which it adheres and contracts it, until they are consolidated together: and they are bound together until they come to the end of their strength and firmness, as it was in the beginning, until it is forbidden by its operations: and for this reason it is necessary that you give the patient nourishing food which has thickness, and weight, and coarseness, as we have said
And thou knowest, that there are various kinds of fractures, according to the diversity of the members: for example, a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull: and a fracture of the breastbone is different from a fracture of the backbone: and in the same way all the other limbs are different from each other: and I come with the remembrance of the kind of fracture which is exposed in his chapter distinguished from the others. Diverse forms of bone fractures also exist within themselves.
Since it is arched in itself, a fracture may also happen in the middle of the bone due to these stars.</start_of_turn> When a fracture occurs along the entire length of the bone, such fractures are called satagiae, that is, stars, and are like scratches made by a knife.</start_of_turn> These fractures are not caused by blows or wounds but by a small crack in the head of the bone.</start_of_turn
Every kind of fracture has its own natural ability, or an instrument peculiar to its restoration, according to the memory of the fracture, distinguished in its place.</start_of_turn
From this it is known that a bone fracture is characterized by its crookedness, its prominence, and its sensation and sound when the limb is compressed.</start_of_turn
When, however, there is no apparent crookedness, no sound under your touch when you touch the bone with movement, and no great pain is found: then it is not a fracture, but perhaps only a slight bending or a small crack. In such a case it is not necessary to move the limb with the hand and compress it entirely, but rather to place above it what the physician remembers, after which the tension should be gradually restored.</start_of_turn
You know that when a bone is arched and breaks into two, besides the stars, all the parts are loosened from their neighbours. In such a case it is necessary for you to begin from the very beginning to restore it, equalizing it before any swelling appears.</start_of_turn
If however swelling appears, leave it for a few days until the swelling subsides.</start_of_turn Then it is equal to itself according to whatever mode it is possible from lenity and ingenuity.
And know that the restoration of it and its equality is easier than bones in which fractures have occurred.</start_of_turn>
Then bind it up according to what you remember of its reminder.</start_of_turn>
If indeed there are fractures in the bones, then it is necessary to extend this fractured limb from two parts, if it is the hand, or the foot: or with the hand, if it is a small limb: or with two bands, or with a band and a hand.</start_of_turn
And let your position be such as you place the limb in a place equal to itself, according to its natural form, until the parts of the fractured limb are extended: then endeavor to make them return to their original positions with all ingenuity, and according to whatever mode you can in the places: and be careful according to your strength, lest you cause more pain or damage through your operation, and endeavor with your strength so that you can apply one bone with its fellow, according to better forms.</start_of_turn>
And it is necessary in this hour to try and touch your hand.</start_of_turn If there is anything diverse there, rectify it, and make it equal to that quantity which is in your power.</start_of_turn
And be careful of excessive extension and compression, as do many surgeons.</start_of_turn For many of them cause this to happen through their operation, either by making the swelling greater or by causing contraction in the limb: as we have seen this to happen through their operations many times.</start_of_turn
Then bind up after the equality, and loosen the operation, and tighten the limb, and rest, and tranquility: and give the patient rest over it.</start_of_turn And make the patient recline, lest he move in the hour of his greatest heat, and his sleep during the course of his revolution, and his agitation, and at egestion, and all his movements in the end shall be in his weakness. And that he recline, lest his limb remain in a position which follows pain For when he feels pain in a position of the limb, or an injury: then it is necessary to change it to another position from which he does not feel pain.
And that his position be equal and straight: lest there arise stiffness in the limb when restoring it
The degree of stiffness of the fractured limb is according to what is narrated.
You know that fractured limbs are diverse in their parts, size, and shape
For those which are small, such as the arm, the finger, the heel, and the like, it is necessary to apply soft padding, fine But for those which are large, such as the thigh and the leg, it is necessary to apply a broad and hard padding
Because the broad ligament connects the great limb and stretches it from all parts with equal force, so that it does not adhere to the wound
Then, after you have evacuated, start to apply a plaster that is convenient for this, on the stump of the fracture itself. Then, start to bandage the ligament over the fracture site three or four times, according as is necessary for the limb: and keep your hand firm with the ligament.
Then, support the part above the fracture site from the fracture site and bind less than you bound the fracture site. Then extend the limb with a gentle inward curve at the fractured part, and soften the tightening gradually until you can remove the diseased part from the sound tissue.
Then take hold of the limb once more and curve it inwards once more over the fractured area with inward curves.</start_of_turn> Then support it with an inward curve towards the lower part of the fracture.</start_of_turn> And let your operation be in the tightening of the curve and the softening of its tension, as we said in the first inward curve.</start_of_turn
Then place between the inward curves a soft plug of cotton or cloth, so that it equals the thickness of the fracture, if there is such thickness: and if not, do not place anything in it.</start_of_turn
Then curve the limb over once more.</start_of_turn> Then make the two inward curves level with each other, and hold them steady, if there is no swelling, neither a stiff abscess.</start_of_turn
If, however, there is swelling or a stiff abscess in that place: then place over that what sits on that abscess, and drain the swelling: and leave it alone for a few days.</start_of_turn Then bind over it once more, and keep the asclepiads in place.</start_of_turn
And let the bands be made from the middle of broad and strong reeds, or from wood from which cribri are made, or from palm branches, or from flax stems: and let the width of every bandage be according to this shape and this figure.</start_of_turn
It is true that the bandage which is put over the limb should be wider and thicker than the rest of the bandages: and the length of the bandage should be according to the size and shape of the limb.</start_of_turn
Then string over Astellas with the other, according to the first stricture. Then bind over with strings as before, with the centre towards the outside, as we have said concerning the stricture: and it is that the stricture should be greater over the site of the fracture: and the greater the distance from the fracture, the smaller the stricture.
It is necessary that the strings be of medium size and flexibility, and that they be made of soft linen.
For if the strings are large, like the ropes of stone masons, it is a great error, because the stricture will fall with them outside the measure
And fine strings are again unsuitable: for you will not follow the stricture with them as with those things which you wish to follow.
And it must not be less between the Astellas than the breadth of a finger
Which if the sick man is pained beyond the ends of the Astellas after the stricture in healthy places: then put under the skin a cushion of soft wool, or carded lanolin, until nothing is pained from that.
When there is a fracture with a wound, and it happens that the tissue is ruptured in the skin, I shall come with a reminder of that in the second chapter concerning the singularity.
And you know that not every fractured limb should be strapped with Astellas from the first day. For when the limb is great, it is not necessary to bind over with Astellas immediately, but after five or seven days, or more, according to your security concerning the progress of the wound
And this is the way of dressing wounds, which the ancient people used to restore, which they put over fracture and dislocation.
The common abbreviated plaster, restoring the fracture, is suitable for various complexions, especially women and children: since it neither increases nor decreases heat.
Take from the flour of the mill, and the barley meal which hangs upon the sides of the millstone when the mill is in motion: and make of these things as before, except that you must not make it too thick, nor too thin. Use it then.
Another method of plastering, restoring the fracture, dislocation and torsion Rice flour, laudanum, acacia, enula and mugath: and vinegar, in total ten myrrh, and aloes two and a half, and alethil twenty, mix them all together, and crush, and mix with lukewarm water or with gypsum if the patient's complexion is hot. Use this plastering. For it is a good composition, restores the fractured bones quickly, and is suitable for many people.
Another plastering method that also helps with fractures and torsion Mugath, flour, white alum, in total ten myrrh, and aloes two and a half, acacia six bol of Armenian bole and twenty, crush them all together, mix with water, or with gypsum. Administer immediately
Method of plastering for bone joints that are separated from their places: and it soothes the pain of the accident, and closes the fracture of the bone and the break of the bone Take fine linen, soak it in vinegar and decocted oil: and put it on the place
Neither is there any restoration to be had in this Emboplastrum, but it is good to apply a warm poultice: and it drives away the pain itself.
The proper treatment for the Embplasia is to restore the fractured bone. Take broad leaves of fig and rough leaves of willow: and urine them together: and make an embolus from both.
The brief treatment of the embolus is to apply it to the fracture of the bone: and when you desire the resolution of the remaining apostematis Recipe for the root of angelica, chamomile, violets and barley flour, take all together: mix them with wine, if there is no warm limb.
If there is indeed a warm limb, then mix it with humid coriander water, or with water, and use it like that
Another method of treatment for the embolus is stronger for the resolution than the first one, when there is a hard apostemata during the restoration of the limb Recipe for the root of angelica, flaxseed, barley, mastic, sambuca, violets and chamomile, take all together: mix them with salty water, or sweet water, or wine This whole thing according to the warmth of the limb, and the quietness of its heat.
Hippocrates indeed did not speak in his book about placing anything upon the fractured limb during its restoration, except for butter made from cheese: nothing else: and he said that there should be a middle ground between the thickness and thinness
Galen, however, considers it useful to place upon the fractured limb during its restoration various substances that contain the exication of heat, such as myrrh, aloes and olibanum, and the like of these things which we have mentioned
Method of Embasting which pertains to the wound and the pain. Method of Embasting which pertains to the wound and the pain. Take parts of mugwort, ciceris, human hair cut, or feathers of birds, and barley and salt in equal quantities: mix them together, crush and form them: make from this the embastment.
As for the quantity, however, according to the need, that the ligature remain, afterwards dissolve it, that is to say, as you consider, if not at once, that no pain, nor itching, nor movement of the fractured bone from its place occur: then do not dissolve it for many days. If in its place there occur itching or tingling, or painful swelling: then act promptly, and dissolve it in an hour, and remove the embastment from it: and take a soft cushion, or a sponge of marine wool, wet: and immerse it in lukewarm water, and bathe with it until the itching ceases, and the pain subsides.
If in its place there occur itching or tingling, or painful swelling: then act promptly, and dissolve it in an hour, and remove the embastment from it: and take a soft cushion, or a sponge of marine wool, wet: and immerse it in lukewarm water, and bathe with it until the itching ceases, and the pain subsides. Then let the limb rest for an hour. Then place upon it a dry cloth, immersed in vinegar and olive oil, or olive oil of roses: and bind over it at night once, until you are secure from a hot after-burn, and the swelling of the limb has subsided, and the pain has ceased.
Then repeat it with slight tightening, and a small embastment: and do not tighten it too tightly at first, but gradually with it.
If you have removed the cause, the swelling, the redness, and the pain, and all the other symptoms have disappeared, and the embastment and the tightening are unnecessary, then repeat it as you did at the beginning equally.
If nothing further happens to the limb of which we have spoken, do not dissolve it, except after three days, or four, or five, or seven days When the wound has healed for forty days in total, according to what appears from the solution of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture has healed and coagulation of the flesh has approached above: then add further strengthening than the first throughout: and also add in the digestion of nourishing food, as has been remembered.
If however the place of the fracture has already begun to abate and expand more than is necessary: then you know that nutrition is hindered from reaching it You must therefore bathe it with warm water at every time you wash it, and keep it so for three days, and reduce the dressing somewhat.
By this means the limb will receive nutrition and will heal more quickly.
That which the rest of the restorers of fractures do carelessly with regard to the limb, when they do not restore it at first as they should, according to what is necessary, and restore it crookedly: this is an error in their operation, and a great fear: for if it had been right, the old writers would have said so in their books, and they would have operated in this way.
I have never seen anyone do this in this way, and it is better to do it right, so that it does not go wrong.
Of the dressing of an injury to the head.
There are various kinds of fractures, and their figures are many: and their causes are diverse.
For a fracture is that which is caused by a blow with a weapon: and the blow raises the whole bone until it reaches the marrow, which is under the bone, as an axe does to wood: and for this reason this kind of fracture is called Axial
If any bone is fractured, and if its face is fractured, and the incision does not penetrate to its very end: this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, absolute fracture.
A fracture is great or small.</start_of_turn>
A fracture is either a break or a crushing: the cause of which is impact with a stone, or falling from a height, or something similar.</start_of_turn>
There are also penetrating fractures, which are those which approach the bone substance, either on the surface of the bone or in its substance: these are great or small fractures.</start_of_turn
There is also an occult fracture which lies within the substance of the bone beneath the hair: this is a small fracture, and for this reason it is called the capillary fracture.</start_of_turn>
A fracture is caused by a fall, or by impact with a stone, or by something similar, which produces a bending of the bone inwards: as when a gust of wind breaks a bowl when struck.</start_of_turn
This mostly happens in the heads of wet bones, as in the heads of children.</start_of_turn>
And all these kinds of fractures are separated by a swelling which I shall remind you of in their proper place.</start_of_turn>
We recognize all these kinds of fractures by their appearance on the surface, by their tenderness, and by the excision of the corrupted flesh which is above the wound.</start_of_turn
The capillary fracture is recognized by the fact that it is seen on the bone, is stripped away, and is bound above with resin: the fracture itself appears black.</start_of_turn
In the treatment of a fracture, consider first the signs of the patient: when you see signs that signify a manifestation above fear, such as vomiting of bile, and swelling, and loss of consciousness, and loss of voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and discharge from the eyes, and redness of the skin, and similar signs in various conditions, it is unlikely that it will heal without treatment; and if you see signs not terrestrial to you, and you hope for recovery: then begin the treatment of it.
If he comes to you wounded in the first place when wounded: and it is in the cold days, then it is necessary to study in the ablation of bone before the fourteenth day of the month in every case.
And if it is in the summer days, then it is necessary to proceed with great care to remove the bone before the seventh day, before it is corrupted which is under the cartilage, and these are the accidents which we have mentioned
If the fracture of the bone has reached the cartilage touching the brain, and it is with small pieces and attraction: then it is necessary to cut away the comminuted and attracted part, according to what has been told you
And it is necessary to wash the head of the wounded: and remove from the bone in whatever way is possible for you: and according to the figure of the wound, and what is best for the patient.
And if it happens to you during the detection of the flowing blood, or a soft swelling: then oppose it with what is necessary for the treatment. And it is necessary to place the place with soaked cloths in wine, and rose oil: and make the wound quiet, until the swelling subsides, and be secure from the flow of blood. Then commence with the care of the bone, and its removal.
And this is done according to two methods.
The first method is as follows: you cut the bone with a straight chisel and a strong knife: this is its form.</start_of_turn>
Then you manage another chisel after the wider one has gone past: and this is its form.</start_of_turn>
Then you manage another chisel which is even wider than the previous one.</start_of_turn
And the second method is that you have several chisels of different sizes: some of them are wider than others, and some are narrower than others: and they are of iron or steel, and you use them easily in striking on the chisel, so that it does not break the head and damages it.</start_of_turn
If, however, the bone is strong and hard: then it is necessary to pierce through its circumference before you manage the chisels, with pins which are called non-deep pins: and they are not called thus except when they do not pass beyond the end of the bone and the cartilage at that point: because the pin is the rounded extremity above that, which is under the acute angle, like the margin, and a small circle prevents it from submerging and passing through the thickness of the bone.</start_of_turn>
And it is fitting that you take from these pins a great number, of which each one corresponds to the quantity of thickness of the bone, until they are present throughout the circumference: whose acute extremities in length and width are according to the quantity of the thickness of that circumference.</start_of_turn
And this is the form of the three kinds of pins, or trephines.</start_of_turn
The quality of the perforation in the circumference of the fractured bone is: to place the thumb over the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been pierced. Then move the thumb to another place, and place what is between every hole the quantity of the diameter of the radius, or somewhat more around it
Then make an incision between every hole on the bone: and do it more delicately than the thickness of the bone from the end of its curvature, as we have said, until you break the bone, or your hand, or with any other instrument which you have at hand: such as tweezers and fine forceps.
And it is necessary to take care, that you do not touch the thumb, or any instrument with your lips.
When you have completed the perforation of the bone and it has been separated from the surrounding tissue, if it is still connected to it, you must extract it, and repair the surrounding tissues with something similar to the instrument which you have used However it is necessary that it should be thin and slight compared to other instruments.
If there remains anything small of the bones and fat: then grasp them with ease with the instrument which is with you from the instruments. Then take care of the wound after this with the instructions which we have given, and with the dressings which we have mentioned.
And another method of operation is easy, especially for one who is long in fear: which Galenus praised highly and praised him for: and this is his saying. It is not necessary for you at first, to remove the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is most pronounced, and most obvious: until you have detected that part, and placed under it the tip of this lenticular incision.
And the blunt part of the lens does not sink anything: and the acute part of it widens in two of its sides along its length, like water: so that the blunt part of the lens rests close to the sac, its acute face being incident on the bone.
Then pierce straight through the incisor from one side with a small mallet, until you have cut through the whole bone easily, as it is turned over: and you will be safe from the spur, which does not happen in this case, as you are afraid beforehand
And even if the physician is not stupid among men, and is more ignorant of this than anyone else, or is asleep, then if anything remains connected to the bone from the spur in some place, he will remove it from that with the extremity of the lens itself, and will set it free easily. It is set free from it without damage, and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate as far as the marrow, and that which is detached from the bone is its surface, and remains in it rough and scaly: then it is necessary to smooth that roughness, and scrape off those scales with fine files of various sizes, so that it is possible to apply something in every place which is more convenient and better for them, and to make them straight, according to what is required by the operation, and the fractured bone itself, and its figure And it is necessary to proceed with your reason, that in the first place you should file the larger of the bones, and then the smaller ones with the files. Then use the finer one afterwards.
And it is necessary to proceed with your reason, that in the first place you should file the larger of the bones, and then the smaller ones with the files. Then use the finer one afterwards. And do not cease to do this until you have reached the point of administering the finest and subtlest of them all
And in every small fracture remaining after the extraction of the stones, and the slight fracture, it is necessary to take care, according to what is required for its rectification.
It is a thing which is not hidden over all, concerning which there is study in this art, and which stands over that which we have written, and which we shall show in great fractures.
If, however, a clot is detected to remain when you are fracturing a bone: then it is necessary that you grasp the clot, according to the quantity of the wound, and submerge it in oil of roses, and place it over the wound opening. Then grasp another or three clots, and submerge them in wine and oil of roses, and place them over the first clot: and make it as easy as possible for the blood to flow over it, so that it does not clot further.
Then support the surrounding ligament: and do not tighten it, except for the amount which is necessary to hold the wound together: and remove it with care after one or two days, until you are secure from the hot after-effect. Then finish it off, and administer afterwards such medicines as are useful for excessive swelling: such as the roots of lily, and the flour of herbs, and barley flour, and violets, and marjoram: and it is necessary that you make from these medicines a powder, which you shall sprinkle over the wound like dry dust.
And in general, administer all medicines which have the property of drying, and not of biting And be cautious according to your skill, so that the wound in your care may be limp: neither soft nor harsh
And be cautious according to your skill, so that the wound in your care may be limp: neither soft nor harsh Neither let blood clot together in this way: for when blood clots together over a clot of the brain, it corrupts it, and putsrefies it, and brings about great harm: and this happens in head wounds, when its care is neglected, and it turns black on its surface.
Consider therefore now, if any accidents befall a sick person, as we have mentioned, you know that it is perilous to delay treatment.
If indeed it does not occur, except for the medicine that is placed upon him, and it is in the benefit of that medicine, that it should make him black: then you must take from the honey a portion one, from rose oil three portions, and lines like these with the ointment.</start_of_turn> Then apply it upon the wound: afterwards take care of him with the methods that are suitable, until he is healed.</start_of_turn>
When the nose is fractured.
You know that the nose is not fractured except for two of its upper parts together, or one of them: because these are two bones: for the lower part of it is cartilaginous and does not fracture, and does not happen to it except for attrition, and twisting, and similar things.</start_of_turn
If one of the two parts is fractured, then you must insert the little finger into the nose-hole, and equal it with the fracture of your index finger and thumb, until the nose returns to its natural position: and do this with art, with ease.</start_of_turn And beware, that you do not cause further pain to the patient by your operation.</start_of_turn>
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and it does not reach the finger: then you must equalize the extremity of the radius, in which there is little thickness.</start_of_turn
If indeed the fracture is in both parts, then do the same: and straighten it out along with the restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible.</start_of_turn If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis.
If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis.
If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis. If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis
If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis.
If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis

If the nose or a tooth is affected, then it is necessary to treat it with poultices: and administer a lead cannula until it is healed.
In the restoration of the lower jaw when it is fractured
When the lower jaw is fractured and its fracture is not accompanied by a wound: then look to see if the fracture is only superficial and does not split into two pieces, and it is being healed inwards: in this case the fracture is easily recognized.
Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, insert the index finger of the left hand into the bone: similarly if the fracture is on the left side, then insert the index finger of the right hand: and push with it until the swelling of the fracture is brought out through the outer part of the bone towards the middle, and with it equalize the fracture itself
If the fracture of the jaw has already been separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to administer an extrusion from both parts, according to the rule: until an equalization is possible between them.
If however there is a commotion or disruption in the teeth: then bind those which you hope will remain with gold thread, or silver, or silk. Then place over the fractured jaw a cushion Then place over it a doubled bandage, and place over the bandage a large sponge made from the middle part of a sole: or an equal piece of skin of a foot
Then bind it up above, according to what is prepared for its ligation, and agree with its application: until it is not broken: and command the patient to rest quietly: and give him soft food
If, however, you suspect that something has altered with regard to some figure or mode: then proceed cautiously and cure it on the third day. If, however, you suspect that something has altered with regard to some figure or mode: then proceed cautiously and cure it on the third day.

Neither is it to break and divide into two, except that they happen in these clots: for it is easier to restore the latter.
Except that they happen in these clots: for it is easier to restore the latter.
Except that there is fracture with wound.
And the operation in these cases when there is fracture without wound, that is, as you make the fractured bone visible by means of two assistants, that one holds the fractured fragment and the other extends the limb beyond the fractured part.
Then equalize the fracture of the fingers, until it takes its form, as it should: and it should not be prominent, nor hollow.
If, however, it does not yield with extension, then it is necessary to put under the patient's thumb a sphere of wool or lint: and let its magnitude be according to the quantity of need: and extend and elevate the fractured bone, and cover the sphere with your hand, until the fracture is equal, as it should be
If it does not succeed in drawing out the fractured limb towards the exterior: because it has gone deep: then it is necessary to recline the patient on his side: and put under his arm the middle finger of his hand in magnitude, and bring the minister of the arm towards the lower part: until the fractured bone which is in the depth comes up: and then straighten the fracture and equalize the fingers.
If, however, you feel pain from the fracture, and it moves: then it is necessary to find over that and extract it with ease.
If, however, it is retained in the bone, then think of an incision for it with one of the [instruments] which you have prepared for this, after you have placed under the fracture the instrument which will grasp the clot: and it is an instrument of wood, or of iron. This is its form.
It is like a conch shell which has no cavity.
Its breadth is according to that which is digested from the size of the bone, and its thickness is equal to that of the bone itself Its length is also according to what is possible for you in the operation
And it has two extremities like nails: one is wide and the other is narrow
If, however, the disruption of the wound which you scored when you extracted the bone is wide, secure it from the spur with a hot dressing: then join together the two lips of the wound with a suture
And if the disruption is small, or the spur is soft: then shut the wound with stitches and pieces of lint according to the quantity of the wound
If there is a soft spur, then pour oil of roses, alum, wine and fat on it, and place above it
The fracture of the bone which is without wound and without section is, as if you placed over the bone a plaster made of flour with barley or wheat germ And place a soft cushion over it Then place a sphere under its head if you digest it. Then take a bandage, which is, a circle like that which the Saracens hold, which is long like two palms, or about this much Then place a doubled bandage over the cushion and the plaster. Then take a needle from a thin board, whose breadth is three fingers, and in length similarly. Then insert the instrument into the cloth. Then insert the instrument with the hook at the location of the fracture which falls upon the fracture and the place of the break. Then place the fracture over the fracture as if turning it round, and insert the instrument over the neck of the fracture and under the healthy tile and under the broken tile: and reduce the instrument over all the parts, and as much as the surrounding structure allows, for the fracture has become loose by the tightening of the structure. And for this reason it is necessary to take care of the fracture every day. Whenever the ligament is softened and the hook is able to move it: then make it straight and tighten the ligament.
Then place the patient's sleep on his back, and place under his tile near his sleep some small cushions in the night, so that when he is lifted up his attendant will not be in the same place as him The fracture of the collarbone is elevated by elevating the arm.</start_of_turn>
Or bind the arm to the chest: and do not loosen the ligament, if it does not happen in the place of injury, or from swelling, up to twelve days.</start_of_turn>
Then renew the dressing, if you wish to see his face to that. And keep tight the structure, and let go of him, until he has recovered and the fracture has clotted.</start_of_turn>
And the fracture of the collarbone is bound and comforted according to most people in eighty days: and when it is in some people in less time.</start_of_turn>
Paragraph on the restoration of the fractured Spatula.</start_of_turn
Rarely does the spatula break, and in its wide place: and they do not break from its margins except for the space between its teeth.
When it breaks from that place, and breaks in the middle, and is not recognized except by touch: then one must prepare it according to the shape of the fracture. And reduce it above the natural shape in every way possible, which is possible for you
Then put over the place a fine powder of mill-wheat with alum, and a soft cushion, and put above it a small piece of cloth doubled over Then put over it a wide bandage from a thin board according to the quantity of the spatula, or slightly more
If indeed there is a concavity in some place of the spatula, then equalize that concavity with a soft cushion until the bandage descends according to equality.
Then bind around it with a long bandage, gentle tightening, and firmness of the bandage, until it does not move from its place.
And consider the ligament in every day. Every time it is softened, string it up, and equalize the bandage if it moves from its place: and lie the patient on his side with his sound limb resting on his sound side
And the spatula will be restored in ninety days, or in ninety-five days.
When these days are complete, then loosen the ligament: and you will be in safety. For the bones from which the ligament is composed do not break immediately, nor are they easily dissolved
If, however, it proceeds from a broken bone, and penetrates under the skin: then cut above it, and remove it. And do as we said in the case of a broken bone from the relaxation of the after-ache of the cold, if anything arises from it.
Of the restoration of a fractured chest bone.
The chest bone sometimes fractures in the middle, and this is rarely the case.</start_of_turn> Its extremities fracture most frequently, and break from its accidents.</start_of_turn
When it fractures in the middle, which inclines downwards, and there is pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing: and perhaps vomiting blood, and a displacement of the fractured bone is declared, not hidden from sense. The restoration of it is that the patient be placed supine on his back: and place between his shoulder blades a cushion.</start_of_turn
Then press his arms, and join his ribs from two parts or sides with hands: and slightly flex them in equilibrium, as much as is possible for it and it agrees, until the figure of the bone returns, as it should.</start_of_turn
Then place upon it a compress and bandage, and place above it a plaster from a thin board of willow, or chalk, and from similar materials in lightness, after you have bound up the limb in cloth.</start_of_turn Then slightly tighten the bandage around the fractured bone, so that it does not move: and stay with the bandage as round as possible to the back, and bind it tightly.</start_of_turn
Then consider the bandage at every hour, and whenever it is softened, tighten the bandage: and if its necessity indicates its solution because of itching, or corrosion which occurs in the place, or pain, or swelling: then remove it, and heal the wound, and remove the plaster, and restore what has happened in the way of its treatment.</start_of_turn>
If the moisture has reached the face, reduce the plaster, and bind it firmly until healing has occurred.
When the bones are fractured, restore them.</start_of_turn>
You know that a fracture of the bones does not happen except in large places following the backbone, and from the extremities from the front part.</start_of_turn And it does not happen except by attrition, because they are cartilaginous.</start_of_turn And its knowledge is not hidden from sense in the inquiry with the fingers.</start_of_turn
And its restoration is done so that the fracture is equal to the fingers according to a possible method, until the figure is equal, according to what is necessary.</start_of_turn Then plaster the bones, and bind the fractured bone with a hook, if necessary for that.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture of the bones is sloping inwards: then it happens with weak pain that he feels, and swelling, like that which happens to him who has pleurisy: because the bone pierces the membrane, and also happens to him difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and spitting blood: and this is difficult to cure.</start_of_turn
And indeed the ancients were skilled in these things with many skills: and among them are those who say that you should put on bandages the sick who generate inflammation and swelling, so that the belly is inflamed, and expands, and drives the fracture outwards.</start_of_turn
We indeed abhor that it should be a cause of making a callous plaster, if it does not happen.</start_of_turn If however it happens, then we add to it.</start_of_turn>
And some have said: Let a wet place be placed upon the site, and then be squeezed with force, for it is similar in reasoning. Indeed, it is known that the swelling attracts the superfluous humors to the place, by reason of the disposition of the bones.
And some have said: It is necessary that the place should be covered with wool which has already been submerged in warm fat: and they put feathers between the ribs until it is firm: that there may be an equal ligation when you bind it according to the circumference
Then care for the patient with treatment of pneumonia from food and medicine.
If he coarsens the patient while he is vomiting, which he cannot tolerate, and the jaw is fractured by biting or from a wound, and we fear over the patient: then it is necessary that we split open the place and remove the fractured rib. Then we place upon it an instrument which preserves the bowels, whose memory preceded it: and we break the bone with ease, and we break the bone itself.
Then we join together two lips of the wound, if there is a great one with a suture: and we care for it with poultices, until it is healed
If meanwhile a cold abscess arises, then deal with it, and pour pultices of rose-water over the place, and place upon it: and care for the patient with that which agrees with the abscess
Also during this time rest upon the side over which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Of the restoration of a fracture of the neck of the scapula and the collarbone.
The bones of the collarbone often fracture when a violent blow is struck to them, and rarely is there any abrasion: and it is the same with the scapulae of the back When anything happens to anyone, and you wish to know whether he is saved or lost: then be silent. When anything happens to anyone, and you wish to know whether he is saved or lost: then be silent. For if you touch his hand, and he is limp and stunned, and dead: you cannot move him, neither extend him, neither bind him. And when you bind him with your fingers and with pins and needles, he feels neither pain nor relief: then you know that he is not saved, and death is imminent.
When he moves and feels relief in his constriction with your fingers and needles: then you know that the broken bone is healed, and that the patient will recover with treatment.
When the patient groans like a camel suffering from the bites of worms, and you wish to know whether he is saved or not: then look at his feet. Then if you see that his limbs are limp and that he is suffering in his hands: then when he lies down on his back, his bowels evacuate without his will. And when he lies down on his belly, his bowels evacuate without his will. And when he lies down on his back and wishes to move, and he is unable: then you know that it is fatal. Do not toil in his care.
If indeed nothing happens to him from this, things are easier.
His treatment from this is as follows: to give him lukewarm oil of roses. So, put some on the back of the patient only: or mix it with rue or asafoetida.</start_of_turn>
Put some on his back every day, until when the swelling has subsided: then put on one of the following compresses on the place where it hurts, an astringent, and bind it up with a ligament. And command the patient to rest quietly and peacefully.</start_of_turn> Let him not sleep over the part where he finds the pain, until he is healed.
If anything happens at the fracture of a bone which is separated from the rest: then it is necessary to cut over the skin and elevate that. Then join together two lips of the wound, if there is a large one, with sutures. Then care for it with some nourishment, from unguents, until it is healed
If however the bone is fractured at the heel of the foot, and the end of the limb is broken: then it is necessary to insert the little finger of the left hand into the heel, and equal the fractured bone by the other hand, as much as possible, and with an evenness
Then put on a dressing, and elevate it: and care for the wound with the care which went before, until it is healed
Concerning the restoration of an ankle
(The provided text does not include the content of Chapter 11, so I am unable to translate it.)
Rarely are the bones of the ankle fractured. If they are fractured, then the fracture of them is not, except for a comminution at the extremities: and they are split in length, and lean inwards: and there is pain in the place, and swelling: and the limb which is fractured stiffens
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it, until you are over the fracture as well as the figure of it is
If the fracture is only at the extremities of it, then equal it up, according as it is prepared for you from the equality, until the figure of it is equal to its natural form.
If, however, the fracture lies in length, or if it slopes downwards towards the interior: then let the patient be placed upon his belly, until such time as the restoration of the fracture is prepared. When it is equal, place upon it a bandage: then place upon it a cushion of wood or leather: and bind tightly around it what you do not wish to shift the fracture, nor remove the cushion.</start_of_turn>
And equalize the concavity of these with that which supports it, until you have taken hold of the patient firmly: and command the patient to sleep upon his back, or upon his side which is sound.</start_of_turn>
If, however, a swelling of warmth arises: then cease from the extension of it, and from the restoration: until the swelling of warmth has subsided: and place upon it what rests upon it, according as before, then return to the restoration of it: and bind it as you please.</start_of_turn>
If indeed it has happened in the thigh bone, or is fractured, extract it.</start_of_turn>
Of the restoration of the fracture of the aides.</start_of_turn>
The aide is that which is between the elbow and the head of the scapula.</start_of_turn
If therefore it is fractured, then the restoration of it is according to one of two methods.</start_of_turn
One of which is: take a plane piece of wood of middle thickness, according to this shape which follows.</start_of_turn
And they are bound at both ends by two ligatures.</start_of_turn
Then it is suspended from a high place: and the patient sits upon a seat.</start_of_turn Then he throws his arm with the fracture over a stick until it reaches the elbow of the limb, where there is a swelling of the bone.
Then he hangs something heavy from above, in order to extend the limb downwards. Then the doctor grasps the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns, as it should be
And another method is that the patient lies on his side: and he hangs his arm from the collarbone with the ligament. Then command two assistants, that one should hold that which is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other should hold the lower part, and extend each of them to their part
And if you wish, that the extension be stronger, then bind under the fracture with the ligament, and above with another ligament: and extend both of them to the two parts
If the fracture is near the elbow of the arm, then it is necessary to put on one ligament under the elbow and another under the fracture around the cubit
And in the same way if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary to put on a ligament above the place and above the elbow itself
Then equalize the fracture without effort, until the fracture is equal according to what is necessary, and apply a good dressing: then bind the limb, if it does not swell abnormally
If indeed swelling occurs abnormally, then loosen the binding until the seventh day. And put on above it a wet bandage dipped in vinegar in vinegar and rose oil, until the swelling subsides: then bind the limb. And the way to bind the limb is that you place a plaster over the fracture.
Then place a new layer of dressing over the wound. Then put on a bandage over the aid itself, and place your hand open over your shoulder
And put on a bandage, and bind over the bandage the arm, so that the arm remains in the place of the bones: if it does not prevent you by anything from this, nor does anything break over you from the broken bone.
If at any time something breaks over you from the broken bone, then put on a larger and stronger bandage over the fracture itself And put on between every bandage the width of a finger: and let the length of the bandages be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers from every side
Then bind over the bandages as tightly as I said at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is, that your binding over the fracture should be tighter. And the more the fracture is elongated, the less tight the binding should be
If therefore you have put on the bandage and the binding, as we have said, when you restore the limb immediately, then do this: and if at any time there is swelling, then loosen the binding and the bandages until the seventh day, as we have said
Then consider the ligament in every three days, that it does not happen in the place of itching, or swelling, or that it should not be hindered from nourishing the limb, by the arrangement of the excessive binding Correct this therefore all, according to what we have said
If indeed you are confident, that nothing will happen from this: then do not loosen the ligament, except after three days, or more
And let the patient's sleep rest upon his back, and his hand upon his stomach: and place under his aid a full bladder of wool equally.
Consider at all times of night or day that the limb should not be fractured, or the ligament relaxed Straighten therefore all the more the pain you feel
And place food for the patient according to the order we have given, so that the food be soft at first, until the bone begins to knit: then it is necessary that he swallow his food diligently
As for the habit of the attendants and the limb: let them bind in quadraginta days: then it is necessary that it be loosed, and a bath be administered, and unguents be used which will rectify it
If the fracture should be painful, raw: then do not loosen from it the ligament and the bone until fifty days, and until two months.
On the restoration of a fractured arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are named the two ulnae.
One of them is the forearm: and that which follows the thumb And the other is the upper arm, and that which is placed under the forearm from the lower part
Perhaps therefore the greater bone is fractured alone, or the forearm: and perhaps both are fractured together
When therefore the fracture of the upper forearm occurs, then the restoration of it is easy, and its healing is easier
And when the lower bone is fractured, the fracture is bad, and the healing is difficult
And it is worse when two bones break together.
If indeed one bone which has broken is slightly above the middle, then the physician must be consulted in order to restore it, so that he may put back the fragment with ease, until it is equal again.</start_of_turn>
If indeed the fragment is large: then it is necessary to put on a stronger dressing around it.</start_of_turn
It is necessary to put on the figure of the hand at the restoration of it, and to extend the limb beyond the wrist.</start_of_turn> And let the thumb of the hand be above the height of all the fingers: and let the lower joint be above all the fingers, or the rest: and let the limb be sitting square upon itself, and let the wrist be forward of it, or in a straight line, in height, so that the limb does not incur any strain.</start_of_turn>
Then extend the limb of the arm from the lower part, or the hand itself, or with the ligament.</start_of_turn And the other limb extends in like manner.</start_of_turn>
Then the physician must equal the bones, until he has reduced them to a better shape than before.</start_of_turn
And if there are gaps in the fracture of the bone, then try to reduce all the fragments to their place with your care.</start_of_turn
And if indeed there appears in it a separated fragment, and it has burst through the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then find above it, and remove it according to the manner which we mentioned earlier.</start_of_turn
And if indeed the fracture is with a wound, I will make for that the single head, so take care of the cure of that from here on.</start_of_turn
If in the beginning of your restoration the heel is stiff, then stretch the band with a slip made from oleoso resin, white lead, and be equal between the thickness and fineness: and bind the band above the stricture with a fine string, until the heel settles down: then remove the slip and apply a plaster prepared from pounded barley flour with eggs. Then apply sponges, and let the sponge which is placed over the fracture be wider and stronger
You know that the number of sponges of the Brachium is six in various positions: if the fracture is in one socket, or in two sockets together.
Then put on your bandage stronger and more tightly over the fracture, and somewhat more above the fracture, or below it: or put on a softer bandage under the bandage above, according as the memory of the fracture is great at the beginning of the chapter.
And let there be cloths which cover the fracture, soft cloths, wet: and not hard, rough And let the thread which is used to tie be from flax, medium between fine and coarse, as we have said.
And consider the limb and the ligament after days. If anything happens whose rectification is necessary, such as itching which occurs in the limb: then it is necessary to bathe the limb with warm water, until the itching ceases, and then loosen the limb, until it is quiet, and then repeat the bandage.
If the bandage is now softened, and the bone is now removed, and things are like these: then rectify all this with your skill, and consider again.
For if the nourishment is hindered from reaching the limb, because of the excess of the bandage, then it is necessary to soften it somewhat, and remove it for a few days, until the nourishment comes to it again, and then tie it again
If, however, no improvement occurs in the patient with anything we have mentioned, it is not necessary to persist in the treatment, except after twenty days or thereabouts.
The treatment of the patient is to be suspended for a period of twenty days or thereabouts. The patient's condition should be stable, and any disturbing factors should be avoided. Let him sleep upon his back
Know that this fracture heals in thirty days, or in thirty-two days; and sometimes in eighty days This is all in accordance with the temperaments of the complexion and the virtue of the patient.
Regarding the restoration of fractures of the hand
Know that fractures of the bones of the hand and the joints of the fingers are rare They do not occur except with great attrition
When, however, such a fracture of the limb or attrition occurs: then it is necessary that the patient sit upright: and before him should be placed a support which is equal in height. Then place the hand above his head stretched out
Then extend the broken bones and keep them even with the doctor until the union is complete
Then it is necessary to apply a plaster or bandage, if the swelling does not subside Then place a bandage above and below according to the quantity of the place: and cover the hand with linen cloth
If, however, the fracture is below the middle of the limb, then make a sphere from cloth: and order the patient to rest with his fractured limb resting on his hand: then bind with a long bandage
And let the stars be from the skin, in which there is suppleness, so that the skin may be applied to the body of the plant: and bind it securely as required.
And if the fracture is to the exterior, then it is necessary: that thou place a star above, and a star below in the plant: and let the hand be open straight. Then place a bandage, as it is turned over with the hand: and extend between the fingers with the ligament.
And if it happen that the fracture be of any bone of the fingers, then if it be the thumb, it must be equalised as required. And bind it with the plant: and if you tie it too tightly, place upon it a star which is straight, firm: so that the fracture be elevated, and not be moved.
And if the fracture be of the remaining fingers, as the middle, and index, or ring, and little finger, then it must be equalised, and bound with the healthy finger which follows it: or they may be bound all together according to the continuation: and that is better Or place upon it a star which is firm as we said concerning the thumb.
And consider in the restoration of it, and after the setting of the limb: and oppose with it that which is required, when anything of that happens again, according as its narration is repeated.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the thigh bone.
The thigh bone is fractured in many places, and is declared by sense: because it is turned inward and outward towards the parts
And its restoration is done thus, that the ligament is bound above the fracture, and the ligament is bound below the fracture. And the sick man returns over his face.
Then extend all the ligaments around the part in question according to their equality: and this when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
If, however, there is a fracture close to the root of the hip, then let the ligament be to the part of the hip, so that the extension rests above: and let the other ligament be under the fracture
And thus in the same way if there is a fracture close to the knee, then let the ligament be close to the knee, so that the extension rests downwards
Then let the physician equalize the bone with his two hands, until he has reduced it according to the natural shape: and join the bone with a good suture.
Then it is necessary to put on a dressing and a bandage, if the limb is not already stiff Which if it happens in this way: then let it be left for a few days, until the swelling has subsided, and then return to your care.
The stricture of it thus be It is necessary to cover over the fracture with soft material, that is, a bandage: and double it twice, or three times: and let remain from it the surplus. Then cover the leg, until the heel reaches the root of the nail
And introduce a long thread between the hip and the leg close to the knee downwards, and bring the extremities of the thread from the upper part of the two parts Then roll over the leg and the hip what remains from the surplus of the other side
Then place over the hip in the place of the fracture itself little nails, and place over the bone of the leg one little nail.
Then the practitioner fills up the gaps between the groin and the knee with soft substances, so as to even out the tension.
Then commence from the middle with strong tension at the site of the fracture, with three or four inversions.</start_of_turn> And the more you stretch out from the fractured area with the ligament, the smaller and softer will be your tension.</start_of_turn>
Then take two threads to the two extremities which you have introduced between the groin and the knee.</start_of_turn Fasten thus with both three knots which are above.</start_of_turn Then draw up with both ends of the thread to the lower parts, until you reach the ankle bone.</start_of_turn> And when you have drawn up both strings also the other ends of the strings from the other side: so that the ligament does not slip out of its place.</start_of_turn
Then release the tension above it, while it remains, so that no deformation, neither swelling, neither inflation, nor anything similar to these occurs to the limb.</start_of_turn Which if anything of this happens.</start_of_turn Properly therefore with the solution of this, and correct what happened before, as we have said many times.</start_of_turn>
If indeed in the bone there is a piece of bone which is pressing: then it is necessary, if possible, to equalize that.</start_of_turn And if not, find above that and remove that: and care for it with that which went before, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And when this fracture of the knee is bound up, besides adding to it knots, as we have said in the chest and arm.</start_of_turn
Truly, in restoring it thus fractured, no infirmity occurs with halting. Though it be restored alone, besides what is applied to the other limb, then it is necessary that the limb which has been fractured should halt, always.
Moreover, you know that the cox is strung for fifty days, or is added a little, or diminished a little: all this is according to the diversity of temperaments, and the remaining qualities.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured rotula genu (knee).
You know that the rotulae genu are rarely fractured, but they are often subjected to great attrition.</start_of_turn>
If indeed it is fractured, then it is not without a crack or a break, or a hole in its parts.</start_of_turn And it is like a wound, and without a wound.</start_of_turn And it stands over that all with sense.</start_of_turn
And its restoration is thus, that it be equal to what was disrupted from its parts with the fingers, until it is reunited and joined together as much as possible, with ease and fabrication.</start_of_turn
Then put a plaster of ground barley, or wheat, with albumin or oil: and put over that a round cushion, if you like: and bind up from above with a convenient bandage.</start_of_turn
Then consider all the arrangements which we have narrated in the other fractures: such as the swelling of the limb, and the like: thus, that you may oppose every accident with that which is suitable for it, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
On the restoration of a fractured limb of the shin.
You know that the shin consists of two bones, of which one is thick and is called the Cruris, and the other is thin and is called the Focile.
Just as happens with both kinds of fracture that occur in the bones of the forearm: and because of this, its restoration is equal to that of the forearm, and the operation is the same
If both bones are fractured together, the shin turns towards all parts
If the thin bone is fractured, the shin turns towards the anterior part
If the thick bone is fractured, it is found beneath: and this is from that which does not cover the bone
Then administer extension, and equalization, and ligation of the ligaments according to that which is equal
But it is necessary to know that if the fracture of the shin is a compound fracture, having much swelling: so that the extension should be less, and the alleviation more gentle
And in the shin there is something like that which happens with the arm: that when you equal the bandages, and have completed all your operations, then take two boards of pine wood which are used in the fabrication of sandals which are placed under the boards: and they are made from palm spatulas: and choose those which are of small size, and neither are they of great size: and be as long as the shin from the knee to the heel
Then bind over one and a half times the thickness of the limb with two bands according to its length And put one part of the shin from one side, and the other from the other side: and they are from the knee to the heel of the foot
Then bind two layers of tissue in three places from two extremities and the middle. When the tension prohibits a fold, the heel of the leg bends to the right and left, and remains firmly in place.</start_of_turn>
And indeed a bandage is administered from wood according to the length of the leg, and is placed on the leg, so as to hold it still.</start_of_turn
And most importantly, it is necessary that you make the limb firm when there is a fracture so that it is healed properly.</start_of_turn>
Then consider the leg every day, and study it carefully for any swelling, or pain, or other symptoms.</start_of_turn If anything like this happens, then oppose it with what is necessary until it is healed, if God wills it.</start_of_turn
Of fractures of the bones of the foot and the toes.</start_of_turn>
The heel does not usually fracture completely.</start_of_turn
The bones of the foot fracture sometimes, and the toes even less so: and they do not fracture except through violent pressure in various positions.</start_of_turn
If the bones of the foot fracture, and you wish to elevate them above the level of the heart, then support the limb on the earth prepared for it like a walker.</start_of_turn
Then stay still, and place your foot on that which is being elevated from those bones: afterwards press, or bind up the ankle: and keep it even, until it returns to its proper place.</start_of_turn
Then apply an ointment, and cover it with a dressing: and place under the foot a board with two flat heads.</start_of_turn
Then bind the string with the foot in a secure manner, after you have included the limb with the bandage, and the rest as needed.
When three or four days have passed, then loosen the ligament.</start_of_turn> For the bone is found equal, whether it is fractured or displaced.</start_of_turn> The operation is like that of an oil bath.</start_of_turn
If any finger is fractured, then restore it and equalize them as I have said concerning the restoration of the fingers of the hand.</start_of_turn Then put under the finger a cushion according to the length of the finger, and let it be wider than before: then put under the foot the board which I have mentioned, and bind the string with the foot in a secure manner.</start_of_turn
If indeed it is broken from the bones are two, or three, or more, then put over every finger a cushion of its own quantity, enclosed in linen: and bind the board at the lower part of the foot: and let it rest on one head of the board outside the foot, so that it may hold the retention of the good.</start_of_turn
And it befits you, that you should not forget, that you should consider all that I have said concerning the remaining fractures from the accidents which we have mentioned: and oppose every accident with that which is necessary.</start_of_turn
Of the fracture of the woman's vulva, and the bone of the hip, and the swelling of the man.</start_of_turn
When the woman's vulva is fractured, then make her sit in a square position.</start_of_turn Then incline the body towards the lower part of the back and hold it back.
Then let the surgeon grasp the thigh with his hand and hold it firm until he has grasped it: and let the limb be round like a sphere.
Then the woman shall be brought close, and the back shall be raised slowly. Thus the thigh is drawn outwards, until it stands before the vulva like a sphere, and the fractured bone returns to its place.
Then put a cushion over the back of it. When he wishes to move, move the thigh easily, then join together: and reduce it according to the manner in which you introduced it at the beginning: then return to its cushion first
Make it rest for seven days, or thereabouts, and the bone will be restored
And if you wish, take an egg-cup or a vessel, and string over its hole a thread of flax, and introduce the whole egg-cup into the vulva. Then blow through the thread with a breath, until the egg-cup is inflated inside the vulva, and the fracture will be restored
Then let it be held with the thigh, and remain for a while as we have said, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And when the bone of the hip is fractured, whether in a man or a woman, then manage its restoration and its healing in the same way as we have said concerning the bone of the thigh.</start_of_turn>
And the rectum is not concealed in its near fractures, which happen rarely, especially in those who have studied or are learned.</start_of_turn>
Therefore understand this book of mine well, for a fracture itself signifies to thee in various positions the alteration in restoration of its own structure.
When the bone is fractured in a limb, grasp the opening of the wound: and introduce the instrument into the very same place.</start_of_turn> Then place upon it a covering of lint, and cover it, and leave it for three days, or thereabouts, and it will heal, if God wills it.</start_of_turn>
As for the restoration of fractures of bones, when they are associated with a wound.</start_of_turn
It agrees with him upon whom it has happened that a fracture is associated with a wound, especially if it is great, such as the hip bone, or the thigh bone, or the forearm, so that you must immediately perform phlebotomy: if you recognize that there are conditions for phlebotomy, such as the above.</start_of_turn
If there is bleeding from the wound, then it is necessary to order the abscission of it, so that it is powdered above the wound: if there is nothing else present.</start_of_turn
Then begin to restore the fracture on the same day: and do not postpone it, if it does not occur spontaneously.</start_of_turn
If indeed spontaneous healing occurs, then cease the restoration on the ninth day, until the swelling has subsided.</start_of_turn And do not approach it on the third day, and the fourth day altogether, for you will cause him to suffer additional injuries.</start_of_turn
If indeed the fractured bone is prominent above the skin detected: then it is necessary to order that you reduce it, and equalize it with your hands with ease and with little extension.</start_of_turn>
If, however, it is not prepared for extension, and its equality is equal to your hands: then reduce it with this instrument. The instrument is made of iron, its length being equal to the quantity of seven fingers, or eight: and its width according to the quantity of the wound. Therefore, the physician must take three, or four according to the quantity that is necessary for the cure of every kind of fracture
It should be rounded: and its size should be small, so that it does not double under compression in the hour of operation: and its edges should be acute, which should have a margin on their edges. And its upper part should reach from the middle to the lower parts.
This is its shape
It is carried out in the operation, so that its acute edge is placed curved over the protruding extremity of the bone: and it is pushed in with that liquid one until the bone returns and is equal to four times its equality.
To attempt to make the extremities of the fracture equal to each other on one side.
If its extremities are slightly fractured and do not grasp well with the instrument, then it is permissible to cut off the extremity of that bone until the instrument has power over it
If, however, it does not seem possible to reduce them with this as we have said throughout: then cut it with that which corresponds to the Scissors which we mentioned: or bind it with one clamp in whatever way is possible to you
Then leave that which remains in the bone from asperities and small cortices.
When the bone has been reduced, and it is found to be painful after reduction, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural position
Do this then. Do this then. For you confer great relief to the sick when you complete your restoration of them as much as you do the bone.
Then immerse the bandage in strong vinegar, black. And if it is in summer. And do not place upon the wound a greasy cover or anything containing oil: so that it does not cause it to become inflamed and corrupt
Then administer as necessary at the end of your restoration of the bone And remove the wound: thus, you will cut through with scissors the hole in the swelling according to the quantity of the wound
And take care in all things, lest you tighten the wound with the fracture. Many times, indeed, have these things been done carelessly by doctors: and they have caused accidents to their patients, either death or corruption, or swelling, that is, illness. And let your treatment be gentle, lenient, diverse in the strictures of the remaining fractures
If the wound is bad, or if it is large, and you fear some other mishap which we have mentioned, and if you find pain in the suspended part: then it is not proper to put on any plaster. And make for yourself from strong paper incisions in the place of the plaster, and tighten it with these.
When however, after one or two days, and the wound has begun to heal, pus has formed: then remove from above the plaster which you put on with the vinegar Then administer ointment and unguents which are customary with us for healing wounds: such as ointment of butter and the like
And it is necessary for you to solve the ligament. Consider the wound every morning and evening until it is consolidated and healed.</start_of_turn>
It is necessary to prepare the limb in such a way that the pus may drain downwards easily.</start_of_turn>
If the wound days pass by and it is not consolidated, nor does the pus separate from it: then you know that there are small bones there.</start_of_turn Therefore you must inquire about the wound with care.</start_of_turn How many of these small fragments are separated from the wound: remove them and extract them.</start_of_turn And what is not separated from them but pierces the limb, causing pain: try to cut them out and remove them in any way possible.</start_of_turn
If swelling or swelling occurs at the wound, or a boil or other corruption and decomposition: then it is necessary to oppose each of these things with that which is suitable for their treatment, as has been mentioned in the chapter.</start_of_turn
And concerning that in which you must understand my words, and to which you must pay attention when a bone is fractured and projects outwards, such as the hip bone, and the kneecap, and similar parts of large limbs, it is necessary not to fear its attraction, for much harm results from it, indeed it is better to remove it than to leave it, until it decomposes.</start_of_turn
Perhaps indeed it will fall away by itself after twenty or thirty days.</start_of_turn
Then indeed care for the wound, if you see it: and otherwise, remove it.</start_of_turn
On the treatment of the swelling caused by a fractured bone.
Many times this swelling occurs in the area of healing of a fractured bone. Specifically, which is close to the joint: and it is caused by the shape of the limb And sometimes it hinders the limb from its natural action
Therefore consider at once, if the swelling is recent: administer in it medicines which have styptic properties, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and the like.
Yes, take some of these from these: and mix them with wine which has styptic properties, or with albumin or with vinegar: and apply them over the swelling on a cushion, and bind them over the fracture itself securely
And remove the support, and do not keep it bound for many days. Then loosen the limb, and repeat this until the swelling subsides
Or bind over the limb a layer of lead foil which has been softened in the middle Lead has the property of removing all that is threatening to the limbs
If however the swelling has already hardened and is fixed, and there is need to remove it: then find above the limb from its upper part, and cut away the excess: or scrape the limb with some rough objects until the swelling subsides: and take care of the limb until it heals
When the limb is restored and the swelling has subsided, the limb remains under its natural shape
When the fracture of a bone has been restored, and the limb remains below it subtle and feeble, it does not become well except for multiple causes. When the fracture of a bone has been restored, and the limb remains below it subtle and feeble, it does not become well except for multiple causes.
When the fracture of a bone has been restored, and the limb remains below it subtle and feeble, it does not become well except for multiple causes, such as the stiffness of the ligament, which hinders the nourishment of the limb, or excessive embrocation at an inappropriate time, or for want of blood in the body and its weakness. And bathe the limb. And give it comfort and joy over it.
Then put a plaster on the limb: so that it attracts plenty of nourishment to it. And anoint it regularly with warm water, until the nourishment recovers and returns to its natural shape.
¶ On the treatment of fractures when they have been restored tortious.
When the limb has been restored after healing from its fracture, and its bending persists, or there is a swelling: and the limb is hindered by that shape, although the limb is not prohibited from its natural action by the operation, it does not follow that it should be broken again
And there have been many proud doctors and restorers in our land who have done this.
And this operation is very dangerous, harmful, leading to death, or great fear, as it is mortal.
But if the limping and swelling are recent: then it is necessary to anoint it with warm water containing soothing herbs, such as elder leaves, and the root of this, and melilot, and similar things And let there be made for him a patch with softening plaster, as for a diachronic centre made.
Or let there be taken root mucilage of elderberry and pounded with fat of a hen, or with beeswax: and plastered thereupon.
Or let there be taken poppy seed, and ground with columbine seed, and such like things as are named by the physicians to reduce consolidation
And when the swelling has been softened by constant friction, as of old, and with moist hands. And move the limb about to every part in every hour.
But if the swelling has preceded the pain, and has become strong, and has become fixed in stone, and has required excision, then it is necessary to cut off the excess above it, and to dissolve the continuation of the bone, and to remove what remains of the swelling or bone with fine instruments: and facilitate this with request and care
From the discourse on Dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of any articulation from its place. Because it hinders its movement and deforms the limb's figure And causes the production of greater pain, and wounds which are dangerous to the limb.
When therefore such a dislocation has happened, then it is necessary to act with speed to restore it: and do not delay at all
For if it is delayed, the place will become swollen, and perhaps with this the reduction of the dislocation will be more difficult
Therefore it is not necessary to move or extend it during the swelling Since many things cause spasms and painful aches.
When such a thing happens, it is necessary to perform phlebotomy on the patient immediately. Then let it be discharged until the swelling subsides
And it should be bound with warm water and oil Let the swelling be gently reduced
And care for every limb so that its memory remains in its place
I command you to join the head of dislocation and the extremities of the fracture from the upper part of the body to the lower part of the body
As for the care of the lower jaw dislocation
The two mandibles rarely dislocate except in rare cases.
And both dislocations happen according to two different methods. Either by slight displacement from their places and gentle softening. Or by complete dislocation, lasting until they are softened at the breast, until the patient can no longer bear the pain, and cannot close his mouth, and his tongue is swollen with saliva
When the dislocation is slight, it returns by itself without any treatment
If, however, the dislocation is complete, lasting: it is necessary to perform a reduction of it immediately, and it must not be delayed: and let the physician keep hold of the thumb of his hand with one hand on the root of the dislocation of the mandible between the bones, if the dislocation is from one side only If the dislocation is from two parts, let him introduce two fingers simultaneously. The remaining fingers of his hand should be outside, so that they may support it equally.
Furthermore, he must command the patient to open his jaw widely and grasp with all his teeth The doctor must stabilize the jaw and urge the jaw back to its place until it returns to its normal position
If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are displaced simultaneously: then he must give him a lukewarm drink of water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy: neither must he attempt to reduce them both at once, as we have said before
When they have returned and are equal, and the patient's bone is closed, and they are not softened: then he must place over the teeth of the patient two fingers, with wax which is made of beeswax: and oil of roses.
And then they are bound with soft ligaments.
The patient should sleep on his back: and his head should be resting between two cushions, so that he does not move it to the right or left: neither must he be forced or urged to swallow: rather let him eat slowly, until when he has moved the pain, and closed the jaw: then he may eat what he wants, and this should be given to him with ease.
He should not toil over the operation of his mouth during eating and drinking, and swallowing, until the jaw is closed and healed
If the reduction of both jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some time, and they are not returned to their places: then many times fever and bitter vomit follow: and perhaps the patient's belly becomes soft, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
When therefore the aid has been performed: then you know that it is a loss, and many times the patient dies from it within ten days.
Regarding the reduction of dislocation of the Furcula and the extremity of the humerus
The Furcula indeed does not dislocate from the inside outwards, because of its continuity with the chest It dislocates outwards sometimes: and it is declared by the sense.
And its restoration is that the patient lies on his back, and extends his arms Then cover the place with your palm of your hand with a strong bandage, for it will return by itself
Then place over it a pad, and beads, and bind it tightly
The extremities following the elbow do not dislocate with it, except rarely If indeed it dislocates on some day: then it is necessary that it be reduced and equalised as we have said, and that it be prepared for you
Then place over it a pad, and beads, and bind it tightly And command the patient to adhere to tranquility and quiet, until he is healed
And when the same cure has reduced the extremity of the Humerus, when it is also separated from its place.
Regarding the reduction of dislocation of the Humerus
Know that the Humerus does not dislocate except in three ways.
The first is that it dislocates to the part of the elbow downwards Secondly, it is necessary to displace [the bone] to the part of the chest. Or perhaps to the upper part of the humerus: and that is rare
It does not displace to the back, because of the swelling. It does not displace to the front, because of the nerves
Mostly, however, it is displaced and comes down to the lower part of the chest: especially in those where the flesh is scanty Since it comes out quickly and enters quickly
In those where the flesh is plentiful, it is the opposite, that is to say because it comes out with difficulty and enters with difficulty
And perhaps it happens to some people by a blow or a fall, and the humerus is displaced by the swelling, and it is thought because of this that it is displaced
It is necessary therefore to examine it until you are certain of its displacement, and then you can proceed with its treatment.
It is recognized as displaced when it comes down to the lower part of the chest: and you must distinguish between a displaced humerus and a healthy humerus For indeed you will find among them a diverse manifestation, and you will find in the head of the humerus a concavity, and under the thumb there is a swelling as though there were two heads: and you cannot reduce the hand to its natural position, nor move it in any way
Similarly, if it is displaced towards the chest or upwards: then you will find a noticeable bulge, and it is not hidden
And of this displacement it is easy to reduce when it is recent, or when it is mild
And its reduction is such that it raises the minister's hand to the upper parts. And then place your fingers under the nail of that [affected] limb, and elevate the joint with force upwards to its place: and the minister will raise his hand and extend it upwards. And then support it below, for it will quickly return to its place.
If, however, it does not return by that which we have said, and if there has been a displacement for several days: then it is necessary to bathe the patient in warm water, and to apply an embolus which will soften and soothe, like decocting wild herbs, barley, and meadowsweet in water, and to administer these things
And then the patient is placed upon his back: and under the nail of that limb a sphere and a bandage are placed, which should be equal between leniency and tension.
And then the physician places his heel upon the sphere, and elevates the arm with force, and pulls the patient's hand downwards.
And if necessary, reduce it according to this method: and it is that you make a person stand by the patient who is longer than him, and that he stands at the side, and that he inserts his arm under the patient's nail: and that he elevates the nail upwards until the patient is suspended in the air And another minister pulls the patient's hand downwards into his belly If, however, the patient is limp: then it is necessary to suspend it with something else, so as to make it flexible: for it will return to its place immediately.
And it is also reduced in another way: thus it forms in the earth a long stick whose head is rounded like a glove of a hanged man: neither gross nor subtle. And then it is placed under the lower part after the upper part of the stick is covered with soft cloth: and the lower part is fixed according to the length of the stick
And then the hand is extended downwards from the other side, and the body is extended from the other side with force: for the suture returns to its place with speed.
If its reduction is difficult by all that we have said, then take care of it thus: take a stick whose length is equal to the distance of two arms, and whose width is equal to the distance of four fingers, and whose thickness is equal to the distance of two fingers: whose head is rounded, so that it may fill the entrance to the depth of the wound, according to this form
Then it is bound over the rounded head with soft cloth, so that it does not harm the stick of the patient.
And it is placed under the wound of the patient, so that the hand or arm is extended over the stick to the lower part: and the stick is bound over the support and the arm and the extremity of the hand.
And the arm is placed over the step of the ladder for the width, and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is let go from the other side. The suture enters immediately.
When it is thus completed the entrance of it is completed according to whatever way is possible: then it is necessary that you place under the wound a sphere equal in quantity to that of wool And then put on a prepared plaster from pounded barley with oil, and white of egg over the whole arm, as it is turned upwards
Then tighten under the thumb the stricture of the decennium: and the ligament will be reversed over the base of the palm: and its hand is connected to its column and let go, neither move its hand for seven days.
It is necessary to put nourishing food to the patient until the limb be comfortable: for it is quicker for its healing.
Then put on a wider dressing after seven days, or five, and take it off when moved. If, therefore, it is firm and not softened, then it is healed.
If, however, the suture is displaced many times, because of the moisture that happens to it, or for some other cause: then it is necessary to administer in it cautery with three holes, as it is stated in the chapter on cautery
If you do all this, and the ligament is dissolved after seven days, and the suture is not firm, and you reduce the palm and the stricture above it somewhat, and it does not harden, and it falls off, and it is not able to raise itself to the upper parts: then you know that the nerves that are at the head of the humerus are either cut, or extended, or softened: and you know that the suture will never be firm in its place.
As for the dislocation which happens towards the breast and the nipple, or to the back, it is done by impulse and extension with the hands: until it returns, and cautery is administered in the rest of the stricture and care, until it is healed.
If after the healing there remains greatness in the limb, and tardiness in its motion: then the patient is treated with many baths, until the greatness is softened, and it returns to its first nature.
On the treatment of dislocation of the Cubitus.
You know that the cubitus joint is easily dislocated and returns with difficulty: and that it is also prone to dislocation in all parts, and above all to the front or to the back
Its dislocation is not hidden: for it hangs loose under the skin and under the touch, according to whatever form it is dislocated And when you join the dislocated cubitus with the sound limb, it becomes evident. It is joined together again, and the arm cannot be doubled over, nor can it be touched with the other arm
And you must, in order to be expedient, reduce the dislocation immediately before a callous swelling forms on it
For if a callous swelling forms on it, its reduction becomes difficult: and it may not heal at all, especially when it is at the back For every kind of dislocation is harmful, and causes great pain: and it descends with great speed with it.
And the restoration of it when it is possible is to extend the limb with two hands: and the arm should be spread out, and the hands of the physician should be placed above the elbow and below it, and he should push with his thumbs together, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place
Or if the dislocation is to the front: then it returns in such a way that the hand is doubled with the other hand, until it comes into contact with the root of the palm of the dislocated cubitus
Which if it does not yield to reduction, then administer violent extension, with force: and extend the arm with two attendants: and let them hold it firmly even, so that it does not move during the extension
Then the arm is returned to its entire extent after it has been bent over the hand, and a doubled long band or a wide ligament is passed over it.
And when the doctor grasps the hand with his grasp, let him moisten it with oil: so that this be from the things which aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease. Then he drives the joint forward with a pushing movement until it returns
And after its reduction, it is necessary to place upon it a dressing, in which there is styptic action, and drying with alum or white of egg: and the structure is to be tied down appropriately. And the arm is suspended from the collar of the patient: and it is left for a few days.
Then it is healed. If, however, the joint remains fixed in its place, then solve the ligament from it and leave it alone
And if you have not properly tied down the joint, then repeat the dressing and the ligament and leave it alone for a few days until it is properly tied down Then it is healed.
If, however, there is still some degree of pain after the reduction of the joint, and the position is painful: then administer moisture in a bath, and gentle friction, and compression, until the pain subsides, or put a poultice over the joint, that is, a piece of fat from a sheep's tail Then it is bound, and it is left for a day and a night Then take away the dressing, and put it into a bath. When it is wet, then gently friction the joint. Then repeat above the same limb twice, and the third time with the bath inside until it is softened.
And if desired, put above the same limb a cushion of fat, moistened, warmed with butter, and bind over it.</start_of_turn>
Do it quickly.</start_of_turn> For it itself is softened and returns to its natural position.</start_of_turn
(End of excerpt)</start_of_turn>
When the limb is moved too violently, the dislocation occurs, that is, the fracture between the arm and the hand.</start_of_turn
And the reduction of this dislocation is easy.</start_of_turn Contrary to the rest of the fractures.</start_of_turn Indeed it is necessary that speed be in the reduction of the dislocation in the hour in which it is dislocated, before it is fixed in its place: or else it happens that in this fixing the limb is made worse.</start_of_turn
And the reduction of the dislocation is like this: place the lower limb of Mahassem on a board and extend the hand: and the doctor places his palm on the prominence of the fracture and urges it until it returns.</start_of_turn
Indeed it is necessary to consider, if the palm has receded towards the inside of the limb: then the patient places the back of his hand on the board along with the extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the limb, then let the position of the limb be inside the board, that is, the inner side of the limb is placed on the board, so that the doctor's hand rests on the prominence of the fracture.</start_of_turn
If he returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind up the part with a settling plaster and discharge it, and do not return to it.
If he does not tolerate it, neither can you perform a further reduction of it, after which days have passed, for indeed a suture will remain according to its nature: and it does not harm the patient anything, except that it makes the hand softer, and you cannot bind anything: then you know that the nerve is severed, or that the tissue is injured.
There is no wisdom in it, except to bind it with cautery close to its base. And perhaps it will cause no further harm.
When the soul does not return, then place over it a settling plaster, as we have said. And bind it up, and discharge it after five days: afterwards it is dissolved and discharged, and the hand is exercised.
If however its motion is hindered, and something heavy has occurred in it: then soften it with warm water and gentle friction, until it is softened
(End of excerpt
When the Finger is dislocated from its socket to every part, or from the palm of the hand to the wrist, or its bone: then extend the Finger and push the dislocation gently with your thumbs, until it returns
Then support the head of the Finger, and suspend it over the part from which it is dislocated, and discharge it in two days.
Then suspend it, and extend it, until it is straight in that day.
When night falls, bind the limb according to its own narration: and do not cease to loosen it in the day: and move it with effort: and bind it again at night.
Do this every few days until it is bound together again
Do the same with the hand if it is dislocated downwards: bind it to the same part, and do the operation as you did at the first time, until it is healed.
Do the same in every case of dislocation
Regarding the treatment of a dislocation of the shoulder joint.
When anyone has a dislocation of the shoulder joint, or a complete dislocation of the collarbone, or many of the spinal bones are displaced from their places: then it is not in this treatment that the sea is useful for the sick person
And the sign of this is that the sickness goes out without being willing, and that he cannot keep it: and many times they soften some part of his limb, or two arms, or two legs, or one of them: or they displace one of the spinal bones from its place
Many times they displace them, because many times they cause a dislocation to four parts.
The one which they displace towards the back is called a gibbosity.
The treatment for this is, if the gibbosity happened in infancy: then it is not in this treatment, and there is no healing from it at all
But in whatever case it happens, whether by a blow or a wound or in some similar way, as the ancients said in a long speech about the old methods of treatment Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginner's level.
Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginner's level.

Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginner's level And the cavity in the wall from which we have spoken, which is close to the patient, is the place where the edge of the board enters. Then place the middle of the board over the spine. And let the physician place his feet on the other extremity And tighten well, until the spine is firm, and then return to your place.
And if you wish, work with the knee which is involved with your hand: and it is that two boards should be placed under the patient’s feet, their length being equal to the thigh; and two boards should be placed under the head of the patient’s foot in the last part of the foot
And the length which is between all the boards is equal to the palm of one hand: and thus it is made in every place where there is a hole through which the knee runs: and fix all the boards firmly to the ground so that they do not move at all
And insert the round bar: and it is the knee through which the ligament is twisted in two holes of the two boards.
And at the end of it is a hole in which the board is fixed, whose length is equal to the palm plus that which is twisted: and in two other boards it is like this
And tighten the ligaments which you have strung in the patient’s chest around the knee which is at his head: and the ligaments which you have strung in his thighs around the knee which is at his feet.
Then remain at every knee which is ministering, who twists his hand with the bandage, with which the knee is twisted: and the physician must equal the spine, as we have said
This is the form of the knee which follows
Then, when Spondilis has returned and the place is evened, it is necessary to apply an ointment of desiccated plaster with albumin. Then, plaster. Afterwards, place upon the plaster a bandage of the width of three fingers, or somewhat more And its length should be such as to cover the area of Gibbositatis and above the healthy part of Spondilis
Then it is bound with the ligament we mentioned And the patient is kept nourished with delicate food until he is healed.
If anything remains swollen in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and soothe, with the administration of plaster as we have mentioned previously for a long time And in that place is administered a layer of lead
And sometimes it happens that the prominence at the last part of Spondilis of the back: and it is thought to be due to dislocation, and that is the bone which is now prominent. Therefore it is not necessary to assume for it any medicine: perhaps because of that it may cause death.
Of the treatment of a dislocated Anchae.
You know that the ligatures of the Anchae, and of the humerus, do not happen except for a complete dislocation: neither does it happen except for a slight displacement and a concavity.
And the dislocation of the Anchae is done according to four parts. That is, because it is dislocated forward and backward
Many are displaced inwards: few towards the front, and few towards the back.
The treatment of such displacement inwards is: because when you join the limb of the sick with that of the healthy, the latter is longer: and the knee of the sick is more prominent than that of the healthy, and the sick man cannot double his foot at the ankle: and the place which follows the ankle after the heel has gone is that where the head of the thigh comes.
The sign of such displacement outwards is that there are injuries contrary to these injuries
The sign of such displacement towards the front is that it expands the healthy limb along its course: but indeed it does not double itself without pain at the knee: and if he attempts to walk, he cannot go beyond that without pain: and he retains his urine and his heel is swollen, and there is a swelling at walking on the ankle
The sign of such displacement towards the back is that it does not expand the knee, and that he cannot double it before he doubles the ankle: and his limb is even shorter than the other: and his ankle is softened, and the head of the thigh is at the place of the hip bone.
The reduction of this kind of displacement is that you should join together again what has been separated for a long time, which has become callous with age. Then if you have administered the reduction, and it remains in its proper position: then there is no longer any ailment in that matter It is not right therefore that an imputation should be made to him of malice aforethought.
But in that case where the displacement is recent, and is of one of the four kinds of displacement: then it is proper in this case to wish to join together, and to extend it inwards and outwards, and to move it to the right and to the left: perhaps then it will return, and no other treatment will be needed.
If he does not return in this way, it is necessary that you prepare a strong minister and extend his leg from the lower part: either with his hands or with a ligament which is bound above his knee. And another minister extends his hand above, so that he may insert his hand under his toes. Then tighten with a soft ligament above the root of the thigh and keep the end of the other ligament taut.
And extend it either from the anterior part of the groin to the part of the hip bone, or from the posterior part to the part of the back
And let the extension be all at once, until the patient rises with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
And this is a common species of extension of four species.
If he therefore returns dislocated as we have said, that is good: and if not, then it is necessary to use all these methods which we have mentioned for treatment.
In reduction, however, of itself when the dislocation is towards the inside, it is necessary that the patient be placed over his sound side. Then put a ligament above the root of the thigh, on the part between the head of the thigh and the groin. Then extend the ligament upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the hip bone
Then take another strong minister of his arm and press the lower part of the thigh and extend outwards the extension which we mentioned before And thus it returns to its place
And this is the easier method of all those methods for reducing this limb.
If, however, he excuses himself from thee, and doth not obey thy order to enter with this kind of treatment: then it is necessary, that two feet of the sick man be bound together with a strong, soft ligament, over two calcanei, and over two knees: and let the length of each be as much as four fingers; and let the diseased limb be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
Then the diseased limb is suspended upon the head of the ligament, which is in the groin: and let its length be as much as the quantity of two arms from the ground
Then command the strong youth to bind the hip: and suspend the limb with the youth: and the youth shall push with force, bending the hip with force, for the bandage will return to its place with speed.
But in its return, when there is displacement outwards, it is necessary that the sick man lie upon a board, as we have said in the case of gibbosity. And bind the ligament over his thigh, the diseased limb itself, and over his breast.
Then two boards are placed, one at his feet and the other at his head. Then is placed a board added in the middle of the foot, fixed well: upon which are bound wet cloths, so that it does not hurt the sick man: and let the board be between his thighs, so that it is not drawn downwards with extension.
Then let all the attendants go to their places, and the physician will equal the reduction by his hand.
If therefore he obeys the reduction, it will be good.
And if not, place upon his own table, and press it down, as we said in the case of gibbosity, equally. The patient must lie with the affected side upwards.
When the dislocation is forward, then it is necessary to extend the limb quickly: and it is in accordance with this that the physician places his right palm on the heel of the patient Then he grasps it with the other hand, and when he has closed it, he extends the limb downwards to the knee
And if the dislocation is backwards: then it is not necessary to extend the limb downwards, but rather to elevate it above the ground: indeed it is necessary to place it on a firm support, as it is also done when the dislocation is wide outwards, as we said concerning its recumbent position on two cushions: and it is upon its face and the stretched ligament: as we said above.
And it is necessary to apply a compress also with a board upon the place from which the joint has been displaced, when the reduction is complete, as is necessary
And the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you: and it is that you extend both legs of the patient: and when you remove them equal, and the patient tightens his limb and expands it without groaning: then you know that the limb has returned, as is necessary: then join together the two thighs, and apply a bandage, and bind as before, that is, with a rotation: so that it does not move outwards to any part: and the patient must rest quietly for three days, or four.
Then loosen the ligament and the bandage, and compare the limb with the other: then if you find them equal in position, then you know that the dislocation has been definitively reduced: absolutely therefore you may allow the patient to walk.
And if you see any softening: then rest, and reapply the bandage, and bind it as before: and leave it for three days.
Then heal it and make it tardy in its walking over both sides for a few days until it is comfortable.
Until it is comfortable.
There are three ways in which the knee is dislocated.</start_of_turn> It is dislocated outwards, inwards, or downwards, that is to the back.</start_of_turn
It is not dislocated forwards.</start_of_turn
Its sign is that the patient holds his limb away from his body at the knee.</start_of_turn If, however, it does not move with the knee, then you know that the knee is dislocated.</start_of_turn>
And the restoration of all these cases of dislocation is that you make the patient sit upright, so that he can extend his limb over it, and place his heel against its face: and place his foot between his feet.</start_of_turn
Then hold the knee with your palms and keep it straight between your fingers over the knee.</start_of_turn Then apply two fingers of your palm on both sides of the knee with force.</start_of_turn And another minister extends his foot until the knee returns to its place.</start_of_turn
And the sign of recovery is that the limb adheres to the knee without pain.</start_of_turn
Then plaster it and make the limb adhere to the knee.</start_of_turn Then bind it like this for three days, or four.</start_of_turn Then solve them.
Then solve them. And let not the patient remain ambulatory for a few days before he is healed.
If, however, he resists reduction, then manage the extension of force with ligaments, as has been mentioned previously in the treatment of an abscess, until it returns
Until it returns.
The calcaneus sometimes returns with a small removal, and sometimes it is dislocated according to its completeness.</start_of_turn> And its dislocation is done either inwards or outwards.</start_of_turn
And the sign of its dislocation is that the heel is swollen, proceeding to the part towards which it is dislocated.</start_of_turn
The treatment of its removal is easy restoration: it is to extend it gently with the hands, and to equalize, until it returns.</start_of_turn>
In the treatment of its dislocation according to its completeness, it is necessary to make the patient sit upright: and hold him firmly with a strong hand from the back of his back, in the middle of him.</start_of_turn
Then take your hand with your right hand the foot from the upper part of it, and with your hand with your left hand from the lower part of the foot at the ankle level.</start_of_turn
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.</start_of_turn Then with the left hand with two fingers.</start_of_turn
Then extend with the left hand, and push forward the heel of the foot with the right hand without straining.</start_of_turn
Do it twice as we have said.
Then drive the heel of the foot to the knee in the third space, and you pull the [ligament] out.
If it returns once in the space, or twice according to this manner, and you equal the foot, that is good: and if not, then do the operation again above it: because it will return itself
But if it is prohibited to you to reduce it as we have said: then make the patient lie on his back on the earth, and fix the heel firmly to the earth below, so that it lies between his thighs: and you will encircle the limb above it, so that it does not damage the patient.
Then take hold of his heel: afterwards extend the other limb, either with your hands or with the ligament which is above the ankle bone Then extend all the limbs against the extension of the counterpart: and the heel will be fixed between the thighs of the patient, retaining it so that it does not draw the body towards the lower parts during the extension.
Then the physician will equal the dislocation with his hands, and the other limb will hold the sound limb towards the lower parts For the dislocation returns with speed.
When the dislocation returns, and it is declared to you that the reduction is complete: then put on a plaster and bandage, and bind up the limb firmly with ligaments, and bind the foot to the ankle bone.
And it is necessary to beware of nerves, which are above the posterior heel, so that there is no tension on the ligaments over them, and that they do not suffer damage
Then let it go in two or three days If the ligament is softened, tighten it; then loosen it on the third or fourth day. Prohibit the patient from walking for forty days. If he attempts to walk before that space has healed, there will be no security that it will be dissolved without causing further dislocation, and it will be corrupted, and will not be cured afterwards
If there is a stiff swelling: then it is necessary to manage it in its quiescence in that place where our story proceeded elsewhere in the cure, and to embolize it, until it is removed.
Concerning the dislocation of the toes, and its treatment.
It is necessary to equalize what is dislocated with little extension without labor: and this is not difficult, indeed it is easy.
If, however, the dislocation is in some part of the ankle: then it is necessary to make the patient sit with the foot resting on the same level as the ground, or on a board: and he should be able to walk like a normal person
Then sit down, and place your foot on that which is above those joints. Then clench your foot with your foot until it returns, and let the swelling subside, and you will find it equal, and it will not appear in the place of prominence
Then place under the foot of him a board that can support the whole foot, which has two heads. Then tighten it with a bandage for three days Then loosen it, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is secured and protected from reduction
On the kinds of dislocations with wound or fracture.
When anything of this kind happens, and you desire its cure and restoration, many things follow in its wake: and because of this it is not right to anticipate over its cure, which is of this kind, except for one who is prudent in the art of long-lasting remedies, merciful, pious, tardy, not audacious, neither presumptuous: and as the physicians sit in the aftermath of a hot bath, they do not depart without giving an order concerning the patient. Except that you know or hope for salvation from perdition with the gentleness of adversity, and in which something of hope appears To attempt to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a cold abscess forms
If the limb returns, as we wish, then manage the abscess: and care for the wound with the things that suit it from the desiccant unguents.
If the dislocation is with fracture, and they are separated from each other in the bone, then attempt to remove them, and do in this what we said in simple ailments concerning the places where they are located
And be cautious according to your ability, and protect yourself from the entrance of fear: according to what has been predicted to you by me
For better is your prayer to your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more safe for your body in your time than all the physicians of the world
