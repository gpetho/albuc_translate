Chapter Eighteen.
On the Fracture of the Woman's Vulva, the Pubic Bone, and the Man's Penis.
When a woman's vulva is fractured, have her sit cross-legged, then lean her back little by little, and have her held from behind. Then the midwife should pack her vulva with cotton until it is full and becomes like a ball in her vulva. 
Then the woman is shaken and her back is raised little by little, so that the cotton comes out until it is at the opening of the vulva like a ball, and the broken bone is returned to its place. Then a pad is placed on her back, and when she wants to urinate, the cotton is removed gently so she can urinate.
It is returned in the way it was first inserted, then she returns to her original padding. This is done for seven days or so, and it will heal.  And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, attach a reed tube to its opening, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva. 
Then blow strongly into the tube until the bladder inflates inside the vulva, and the fracture will return to place. Then pack it with cotton and continue as we have described for several days until it heals.  As for when the pubic bone is fractured in a man or woman, the following is used in its repair.
Its reduction and alignment are as we described for the hip bone.  The correct procedure in these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, will not be hidden from you, especially for someone with some experience and who understands this book of mine well, because the fracture itself will guide you in most cases.
on the correct way to reduce and bind it, so understand. As for the penis of a man, if it is fractured, take the trachea of a goose, insert the penis into it, then place a bandage of cloth over it, and bind it, and leave it for three days or so until it heals.
