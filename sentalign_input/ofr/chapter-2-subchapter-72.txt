of erysipelas
Erysipelas occurs when a woman's nature is not pierced, or the opening is small;
and it is natural by birth, or accidental through illness that has come there;
or it is because of added flesh, or from thin or thick syphac, and is made deep within the womb, or on the sides, or below, or wherever it may be;
and it prevents conception, and childbirth, and perhaps having menses;
and the diagnosis of this is by examination of the vulva.
If the blockage is clearly apparent, search for it with your fingers or with a probe.
If it is from thin syphac, and it is near the two lips, hurry, and round it like this:
put your two index fingers together, and let the woman be on her back, with her legs spread;
then spread the two lips firmly, until the thin syphac is round, and the blockage is opened;
then take wool, and soak it in oil, and put it on the place, and let the woman lie at home each day, so that it cannot close up.
And if the syphac is hard and thick, you must cut it with a myrtle-leaf shaped spatula.
If the blockage is of newborn flesh, then lift it with a hook and cut it;
and have blood-stopping medicines, such as acacia, dragon's blood, incense, mixed with egg white;
then insert a large lead tube so the wound cannot close;
and leave it there for a long time, and insert a dry linen tent;
then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And when proud flesh grows in the marrow, it should be cut in this manner, unless it is a cancerous abscess.
For a cancerous abscess that is in the marrow, one should not touch it with iron (a surgical instrument).
