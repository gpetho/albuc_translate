Chapter 4:
On the Restoration of the Jaw when it is Broken.
When the lower jaw is broken without a wound, if the fracture is only external and not split into two, and is bent inward, it is easily recognized.
If the fracture is on the right side, insert your left index finger into the patient’s mouth; similarly, if the fracture is on the left side, insert your right index finger; push the bulge of the fracture inward easily to the outside with your other hand on the outside of the bone; gently align it.
If the jaw fracture is already split into two, administer extension of both parts in a straight line until it is possible to align them.
If the teeth are dislocated or disrupted, tighten those you hope will stay in place with a thread of gold, silver, or silk; then place cerate over the broken jaw, then place a folded cloth, and over the cloth a large, properly made splint, or a piece of sole the length of the jaw; bind it appropriately so it stays secure.
Instruct the patient to rest and keep calm, and provide them with liquid food.
If you think the shape has altered in any way, untie it on the third day; then correct the alteration and apply plaster with flour, egg white, or sesame flour, after removing the cerate, and place cotton over the plaster.
Once the plaster is set and the bone’s position is not altered, leave it in place until it is healed and the fracture is secured, which often happens within three weeks.
If another abscess forms, apply the same treatments we mentioned for healing until it is completely healed.
If the fracture involves a wound, check if a piece of bone is separated or splintered, then delicately remove the splinters with appropriate instruments.
If the wound opening is narrow, enlarge it with a phlebotomy instrument as needed.
After removing the splinters, if nothing remains, suture the wound if it is wide; if not, apply a suitable plaster to heal it until it is fully healed.
