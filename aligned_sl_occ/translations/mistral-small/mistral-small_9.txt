O, children, since I have completed this book for you, which is the last of the science of medicine, by completing it you will achieve its end, and through its explanations and clarifications, it is clear to me that I should present this treatise to you, which deals with surgery as part of the medical practice.
For the practice of surgery has been abandoned in our region and in our time, it is almost completely lost, and its traces have disappeared; nothing remains except some brief descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which were altered by most and misunderstood, until their meanings were closed off and the force and art of it was weakened.
And it seems to me that I should revive it by organizing this treatise in the way of explanation and clarification and summarization; and so that it comes with the forms of cautery tools and other instruments of the work, as will be explained by addition of clarification, and for its preparation, which is necessary.
But the reason why a good craftsman with his hand is not found in this our time is that the art of medicine is long, and its practitioner must be well-versed in the science of anatomy, which includes knowing the arrangement of members and their forms, as well as their connection and separation; and having knowledge of bones, nerves, and tendons, their number and function; and of pulsating veins and quiet ones, and the places where they emerge.
And for this reason, Hippocrates said that it is not just about the name but rather in the action, and especially in the skill of one's hands.
But we have already mentioned that in the beginning of this book; for those who do not know what we have said about anatomy will fall into error, by which men die - as I have seen happen to many, because some are trained in this science and yet practice it without knowledge or experience.
For I saw a foolish and inexperienced doctor cut an scrofulous abscess on the neck of a woman, and he also cut some arteries in her neck so that much blood flowed until the woman fell dead into his hands.
And I saw another doctor who attempted to remove a stone from a man who had developed an inflammation in his bladder, and the stone was large. He reached for it and drew out that stone along with a piece of the bladder, so that the man died on the third day.
And I had called for it to be removed, and I saw that because of the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I knew beforehand that he would die.
And I saw another doctor who took a stipend from a duke of our land to perform surgery, and it happened that the patient was a black eunuch whose thigh bone had been fractured; and with his ignorance, the doctor prepared by placing pulvinas and astelas on the wound with strong compression, but did not allow the wound to have air circulation.
Then he unbound him according to his desires, and then bound him again, and left him like this for some days, commanding us to unbind the bandage; and it happened that the thigh and the foot became infected with pustules, and it came to ruin.
And I was called to him, and prepared to unbind the bandage, and immediately obtained peace and relief from his pains.
But still the corruption was confirmed in the limb, so that it could not be restrained, and the corruption continued to spread throughout the limb until the patient died.
And I saw another doctor who punctured a cancerous abscess, and it became ulcerated after a few days, until the evil of it was greatly increased with him.
This text appears to discuss the treatment of patients with specific medical conditions related to bodily humors and injuries. Here's a line-by-line translation:
And for this, children, it is necessary that the operation with your hand be divided into two paths: one is an operation associated with health, and the other is a work associated with danger in the greatest situations.
And I have already addressed this in every place in this book where there is an operation that involves error and fear; therefore, it is necessary for you to guard against this and leave that, so that the pages do not find a way to speak and dishonor you.
Therefore, take up your arms with diligence and under the protection of God, and may your patients be fortunate and steadfast.
And use the best method so that by the grace of God they may attain health and praiseworthy success, and leave behind terrible diseases that are difficult to heal. Avoid those things that cause you fear, so that trust in your faith and in your name does not elude you: for greater is your glory, both in this world and afterwards in your sanctity.
Gualia has already discussed some of these topics in his lectures: “Do not treat diseases badly, lest you be called bad doctors.”
"And I have already divided this book into three chapters.
"The division of the book begins here, first with the initial section. "The first chapter is about feet, specifically the forms of instruments and the tools used for cautery, and what is necessary for the operation.
"The division of the second section. "The second chapter is about incision and puncturing, cupping, wounds, and the extraction of arrows or similar items; all are categorized and ordered according to the forms of instruments.
"The third chapter is about restoration and dislocation, and the care of fractures and similar conditions; it is ordered beginning with the feet, and concerning the forms of instruments.
"I should explain the qualities of the instruments for that cautery and their disadvantages, and in which conditions caution is advised against using it.
"Therefore, I say that the discussion of the qualities of the cautery instrument and its disadvantages is long and intricate, subtle in knowledge, and hidden secretly; many wise people have spoken about it and disagreed, and I can only grasp a little of their discussions, for fear of making this too lengthy." ︎
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
In the context of a dry and cold condition with material, caution should be taken; for some say that cautery is beneficial for this, while others disagree, stating that cautery is not suitable for an illness caused by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is inconvenient that a cold and dry illness be treated with something that is hot and dry.
And those who say the opposite should be rebuked, for it is beneficial to apply cautery to every cold and dry illness that appears in men's bodies, because when you compare man's body and its moisture to the nature of fire, you find man's body to be cold.
And I say by their word that experience has already revealed this to me several times.
However, it is not fitting that what has already been approved and practiced in the chapter on cautery by previous experience be changed, since one knows the diversity of human constitutions and the disposition of illnesses within them, as well as their causes, accidents, and the duration of these conditions.
But in other conditions, you should not fear this, and especially in cold and moist illnesses, because all doctors have agreed on these, and they are not contradictory regarding the benefit of cautery in them.
And know, my sons, that the secret of healing through cautery with fire and its beneficial effects are also seen in cautery with medicine, because fire is simple and its action only affects the member being cauterized and not the adjacent members except for minor harm.
But the action of medication cautery reaches those members that are close to it, and it quickly brings on a difficult-to-heal condition in the afflicted member and is swiftly applied.
But fire, due to its sublimity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this except that it superfluously removes [something]. And it is known to us through experience and long service in studying the art of truth about the causes; and because of this I am excused from the length of the sermon. And if it were not that it is not allowed in my book, I would have kept a secret with you about fire, and the quality of its operation on the body and its expulsion by which it drives out illnesses, demonstrated through philosophical discourse, which would sharpen your minds.
And know, my sons, that they disagree about the time in which it is appropriate to perform cautery and they consider the best time to be in spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at any time, because the harm caused by accidental events is suppressed by the aid of what is drawn with the cautery, and especially if the cautery is for pains or necessary pains, strong and fistulas, which do not tolerate delay because it is feared that evil will come from them, which is greater than a small harm entering over time.
And this is not in your thoughts, or sons, what only the common people and foolish doctors think, because for that illness which is cured by cautery there is always a cure, and they pause with that consequence.
And the cause is not at all as they think because of this, for cautery is nothing more than a medicine that alters the complexion and dries the moistures which are the cause of pains.
But nevertheless, cautery exceeds medicine in speed of its virtue and strength of its operation, and the greatness of its lord.
And it is possible that his illness may return at some point in time, according to the patient's complexion and the location of his illness, and his strength, and what is prepared in his body from the accumulation of superfluities, and what has come to him from his acquisition of food and similar causes; except that the illness in which cautery is administered be an illness of a subtle member with few superfluities and moistures, such as a tooth cauterized for pain, it is possible that the pain may not return to him, but this happens rarely.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And the cause of this is contrary to that; and the intention that cautery is the last remedy of medicine is only when the ways of treatment in some diseases are administered, and those medicines do not confer health, and at the end of the cause a man administers cautery, and profits from it. And then here is the proof that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, not according to the opinion which I understand from the common and foolish doctors.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they said this not because of the equality of gold but because of the sublimity of its substance.
And they said that the site of cautery does not cause a scar, although this is not absolutely true, because I have proven and found that it does so in some bodies but not others; and cautery with gold is good and better than with iron as they said; however, when you perform cautery with fire and gold, it is not clear to you whether it will be successful according to the quantity of gold you want, because it prepares to receive a cold; and if you put on it ignition, the gold melts in the fire, and some leaves fall into the fire due to the occupation of that.
And for that, a cautery with iron should be made more gently and precisely according to the requirements of the operation.
And I have already ordered this chapter on cautery according to the previous chapters, and I have ordered those from the head down to the feet, so that I may ask the reader what he wants from it.
The first chapter.
This cauterization deals with cold and dampness, from which arise two harmful accidents: one is called a headache, the other a multitude of fluxes or rheumatic flows from the head to the parts around the eyes and ears, causing much sleepiness, toothaches, and throat problems, as well as universally all illnesses that come from coldness, such as paralysis, headache, apoplexy, and similar ailments in those afflictions.
The form of this cauterization is as follows: firstly, instruct the patient to take a purgative medicine that cleanses the head for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient, their age, and their habit.
And then command him to shave his head with a razor, and then make him sit between your hands on a stool and place his hands on his feet.
Certainly! Here’s the translation for the given line: "However, once the point on the middle of the body has been reached, mark that spot with a tentacle, and then ignite the pointed cautery made from olive wood.
"Then place that [cautery] on the marked spot with a tentacle, in such a way that it descends, and with which you compress little by little with your hand, and then turn it.
"Then slightly lift your hand and look at the spot, and if you see any amount of bone exposed, even as small as a grain of sand, then raise your hand. If not, return your hand with that iron, or another one, until the bone is seen.
"Then take a little salt and dissolve it in water over the spot, and leave it there for three days.
"Then place a cloth soaked in vinegar over the burned spot and leave it there until the scar of the fire is destroyed. "Then treat the spot with Tetrapharmacon ointment until it is healed.
"And they say that while the wound remains open, the better for the arm, because it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them say that the vein should be cauterized inside the bone, and the cautery should be held until a part of the bone's appearance changes.
And then scrape away what is attached to the bone, and then let it be healed.
And others say that with the cautery one should reach to the rear, until it presses strongly on the bone, and breaks it, and this is the method of small incision. And they believe that from that place, the vapors of the head are expelled.
And the wound should be kept open for a long time, and then it should be healed until it is solidified.
But I have not seen these two species of cautery for all things, only in some men according to the way of fear; and let that be, in my opinion, better is with health than without it, because the head is relieved by dissolution of its continuity thus as we have shown in the other members, especially when the patient's head is of a frail nature.
And the first species of cautery is safer and better in my opinion; and with it and with that work, with health.
Chapter two.
"About the use of cautery on the head.
"When there is a chronic and prolonged pain in the entire head of the patient, and they have used cupping glasses, leeches, head purges, plasters, bandages, helmets, compresses, and similar treatments, especially if they have already been cauterized with a cautery that causes blisters but does not benefit them, then consider whether the patient's head is of strong constitution by nature; if it is not fragile and there is a large amount of heat, then cauterize again with another cautery slightly below the first one. "Then cauterize that area on the crown of their head with a cautery until the membrane is broken. "Incise the membrane and expose the bone to the extent that we have mentioned, and then cauterize with a cautery in the back part of the head in the place called 'vas'—and that is the location where a cupping glass is applied. "And be careful with this, and do not expose the bone, because the patient finds great pain from this, different from the pain of all other head cauteries.
"And I say this because the cautery used for the crown of the head and the occiput should be finer than the one used for the middle part of the head; and this is its form.
"Ters" is likely derived from the Latin "tersus," meaning clean or pure. So, "Capitol ters" would translate to "Clean capitol" or "Pure capitol." However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact meaning in this specific text.
This sentence appears to be discussing an old treatment for headaches or migraines using a process called "cauterization." A literal translation could be:
When pain occurs in the area of the head or if there is persistent pain within the eye, it should be evacuated with purgative medicines for the head, and another treatment should be administered that I have mentioned in the sections on illnesses; and if this does not help, then cauterization is done in two ways: either by cauterizing with a sharp instrument or with iron.
Cauterization with a burning medicine is performed by taking a piece of wool, cleaning it and tying off both ends. Then you should make an incision in the painful area of the temple with a sharp needle until it is deeply placed under the skin, so that it is hidden.
Then press on it with a compress to increase the pressure, and leave it for the space of three hours; then remove it and extract the wool, and let the wound bleed for two or three days, and then place a moist cloth over it until the area becomes soft.
And then treat it with an ointment until it is healed.
Or, if you prefer, do this with some burning medicines that I have written about in the tenth treatise on burning medicines.
Certainly! Let's break down and translate this sentence into English step-by-step.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the provided sentence:
The text appears to describe a process involving caution and care when dealing with pain or a wound. Here's the line-by-line translation:
And if the quantity of him that is tied by the rope is such that it reaches up to half of his body, then raise your hand to ensure that the artery below is not tied, so that blood flow is not stopped.
And then apply a clean cloth in salt water and place it on the wound, and let it sit for three days; then replace the cloth with a fresh one and continue treating with ointment until it is healed.
And if you need to, cauterize with the tip of the scalpel as you would with a cautery, and be careful not to cut an artery in this specific area, especially an old one.
Chapter Four.
On the Cauterization of Ancient Migraine.
When you treat migraine with the methods mentioned in the previous treatment and in the classification of diseases, and if the treatment does not work, and sometimes due to the severity of the disease, what we said about the first cautery with medicine or the cautery with fire is not enough, then you should heat the scalpel until it is red-hot. Mark the area of pain with a line as long as the middle finger, or whichever finger fits best; and place your hand once and press firmly to ensure that you do not cut an artery and that you reach the bone.
Certainly! Let's translate the sentence:
And if it concerns the care and caution regarding bleeding from an artery that has been cut, because there is fear in cutting it, especially for those who do not know what to do and are not knowledgeable or experienced; and leave the operation to someone skilled at the beginning.
And I come with a reminder of the treatment for bleeding from an arrow wound according to its manner, in its section of this book.
And if this method of treatment with the cautery is not sufficient and the patient's condition is tolerable, cauterize in the middle of the head as we have described, and care for the wound until it is healed.
And if you prefer, administer the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on arrow wounds with two-edged cauteries, and this is a better and more effective cauterization.
Chapter V
On the cauterization of ear pain.
When ear pain occurs due to cold and is not relieved by laxative treatments or other cures mentioned in the division, then apply a pointed cautery, and this is called a 'puncture'. The form of this is as follows:
And then puncture near the inflammation, and lead it around the entire ear as if on a wheel, or in the circumference of each example if the pain is in each one. And go along with the cautery tip towards the rim of the ear little by little, after you have marked the spot with ink.
And if the cautery point is made in all of the ear, and this happens, then cure the places within so that they may be healed.
Chapter VI
On the Cauterization of the Turtle Dove
The turtledove, which is treated with cautionery, is not anything other than the species that come through phlegm, according to what we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid cauterization for the species that comes from dryness or from a spasm of the nerve.
When you cure that species of turtledove with cups and cupping glasses and gargles, and your cure does not improve, then it is necessary for you to cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one on the rim of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery opposite the affected area, for softening will only occur in the part that appears healthy.
And the method of cauterization is to cauterize with the cautery on the right side at the end of the earlobe, a little above the corner of the head, and in the temple another, the length of which should be according to the length of this finger, and you must place your hand with the cautery until half of the volume of the vein is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is made from the blacksmith's tool, the shape of which is shown in front of you. However, it should be more refined than this one; and it is necessary to remove a little of its excess thickness.
And then care for the place with water that has been processed beforehand, until it heals.
Chapter VII
On cauterizing old apoplexy.
When apoplexy is old and you treat it with the water we mentioned, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize them with four cauteries: on all the corners of their head; and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said; and with a cautery in the nape. The manner of using the cautery is done as mentioned above.
And already it has been cauterized on the opening of the stomach; and it is still worse; so quickly it should be treated with water that comes out.
Chapter VIII.
On cauterization for forgetfulness caused by heat.
Give the patient large cups and pills to serve as cleansing agents at the beginning.
Then shave all of the patient's head and place on their nape an emplaster of wax, as described in the treatise on emplasters.
And do this several times, because that is the manner of cauterization. And do this according to the aforementioned order which I have already mentioned.
And thus if by those [cauteries] he is healed well; and if not, then make three cauteries on the back part of his head, which should descend from the most superior part of the head into the most inferior part of the neck. And place between each cautery the thickness of a finger, and then treat the cautery with water that has been used.
But if the swelling increases and the patient can tolerate it, then make a cautery in the middle of the head; and if the swelling is even greater, then cauterize on both temples.
Approach the wound that needs healing; and let the cautery be olive oil according to the form given before.
Capítulo IX
Sobre la cauterización de hemorroides y la suavización de todo el cuerpo.
Debes proceder con la purificación del cabello con jarabe y agua como hemos mencionado; luego afeita el cabello del paciente, y luego cauteriza su cuero cabelludo en el medio del cráneo, y con cauterio sobre todas las sienes, y con cauterio sobre la parte posterior de él, y con tres cauterios sobre los huesos del cuello.
Y si es necesario en la debilidad del cuerpo por exceso y las debilidades del paciente son fuertes, entonces cauteriza con cuatro cauterios sobre los huesos de la espalda, y luego con un cauterio hasta que esté cubierto desde el nacimiento de su nuca, y levanta ligeramente tu mano. Luego, cuida la herida que necesita ser sanada, y este sea un cauterio de aceite de oliva.
Capítulo X
Sobre la cauterización de la epilepsia.
No se cauteriza al epiléptico a menos que la epilepsia sea causada por flegma.
And therefore it is necessary to modify the brain of the patient at the beginning with years and with the other cure that we have mentioned in the division when the patient is great and tolerates the rejection of the medicines.
And if it is a child who does not tolerate the medicines, then administer purifying and chewable syrups to serve as cleansers, doing so for several days with an improvement in the food.
And then shave the head of the patient, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head according to the previous manner, and with another cautery on the back of the head, and above each corner of the head, it should be cauterized. And if the patient is strong and tolerates it, then cauterize with the cauteries mentioned above, having previously softened and relaxed the body on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped, as has been stated before.
But if the patient is a child, then place a delicate cautery according to this manner.
Chapter XI
On Cauterization for Melancholy
When the causes of melancholy are corrupt humidity and thick phlegm, then cauterize with the cauteries mentioned above, having previously softened (the area).
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess declining into melancholy, and the body of the patient is moist, then give them water to cleanse their brain according to what has been said previously in the division.
Then shave the head of the patient, and then make a modest tourniquet for them on the crown, and then place that in the middle of their head.
And let the patient be sitting upright, and let him be held by assistants from all sides.
Then apply an ointment; and it is more fitting to use ancient ointment of sheep. And warm that over the fire for temperate heat, the measure of which is what he can tolerate most. Then pour that in the middle of his head on the crown, and let it run inside until he is fully soaked.
And do this with the patient once a week for the whole week along with his other treatment until he is healed; or if you wish, cauterize that by making small points according to his ability, unless you have a hand with a cautery arranged in this way: this is the type of cautery which moistens the brain equally.
Then place that cloth dipped in ointment or grease of lard.
Sure, I can help you with that. Please provide me with the first line or passage from the text that needs translation.
It seems like there might be a mistake in the provided sentence as "De cauterisacio" does not seem to fit well within the context of medieval medicine. Could you please recheck and provide the correct text?
When you have determined the beginning of water in the eye through the signs I mentioned earlier, begin and give the patient to drink a substance that purifies their head, and keep them away from all moisture.
And make him bathe in warm water for several days.
And then command him to shave his head and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head; and also cauterize it with two cauteries on both temples if the beginning of water is in both eyes, or on one side if it is in one eye.
Cut with the cautery all the veins and vessels that are below the neck; and let the cauteries be placed as far as possible on the temples.
And beware of blood flow when it is cauterized; and if you see blood flowing from him, stop it with some medicine that is available to you.
And I will come with wisdom concerning the extraction of vessels and their abolition, and the prevention of blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck below two bones with two very sharp cauteries.
Chapter XIII
Of the Cautery of Ancient Tears
When tears from the eyes are chronic and occur through the veins and arteries in a clearly visible area of the head, and it has been confirmed that this is due to superfluous phlegmatic humors, then cauterize that area with the cautery we have mentioned in the chapter on water falling into the eyes, and also cauterize in the middle of the head and with two cauteries in the neck below two temples, and with two cauteries in the neck below two bones. And if additional treatment is needed, then cauterize that along the entire length of the tail of the eye, on the outer edge of the eyelid, with a small cautery.
Chapter XIV
Of the Cautery for Nasal Fetor
When you treat with the water we have mentioned in the section and your treatment does not take effect, then prepare and give to drink to the patient the cochineal for three nights; and then shave the head of him, and cauterize it with a cautery made from copper with an olive oil-based cautery. And then cauterize that area with a clove-shaped cautery, using two cauteries on the upper eyelids just below the eyebrows, slightly.
And be careful not to burn it too much.
And here is the shape of the clove-shaped cautery.
Chapter XV.
On the cautery for softening the eyelids of the eyes.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with a lunar-shaped cautery; and this is its shape:
And if you [the doctor] cauterize it on the upper eyelids just slightly with two cauteries in each section, and they should be elongated towards the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the eyebrow.
And do not press too hard with your hand on the cauteries, but only until the third of the eyelid is burned. ️
Chapter XVI.
On cautery of the eyelid when the hairs turn inward and harm the eye.
When the hairs of the eye turn inward so that they harm the eye, cauterization can be done in two ways: either by burning or with a burning medicine.
If you use a heated cautery on the patient, instruct them beforehand to shave their hairs as those who are being washed do, until they are extended and smoothed; and if you need to apply it to their private parts, then strengthen their ankles with a bandage so that they will not be moved until the hairs have grown back.
Therefore, once they have grown back and been smoothed, then place the patient's head on your lap, and sign over the eyelids of their ankles with a tent, with a sign that is according to the shape of a maple leaf, and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs.
And then place a cloth soaked in egg white or in birdlime on the ankle.
Then heat the cautery, the shape of which is as follows.
Then cauterize over the figure that you have signed, little by little, in visible spots, until the surface of the tendon, which is like a maple leaf, is entirely burnt, clearly visible.
The sign of the healthiness of your work is that you will see the eyelid of the ankle already contracted and the hairs raised towards the puncture of the ankle.
And so lift your hand and leave it for three days, then place over the swelling a cloth until the scar is healed. Then treat that with ointment until it is healed.
But if it returns through the hair for some reason and the eyelid is softened, then do another time the cautery on that, just as you did previously.
But if the hairs are on the eyelid side, then cauterize that until it is raised to its natural place and healed, and so that the hairs do not touch the eye.
But burn the cautery with medicine, this is what you command to the patient, that he should lengthen and heal the hairs, and then make a paper leaf in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
And then take known soap and add one egg or two, and mix those ingredients well, and do this quickly so that it is not cooled; and then spread some of that water over the paper which is made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place that on one eye or both; and place a cloth dipped in egg white under the eye, and let the patient's head be in your lap.  :)
And place the medicine on the wound and press it gently without removing it until the patient feels the bite of the medicine, for the bite is in them as if by fire.
And when the patient perceives that they have experienced the bite, then release the medicine and apply it with your finger; when the bite ceases, then remove the medicine and wash the wound with water; and then consider if you see the eyelid raised as if it were washed with the cautery of fire or incision, for then it is well; and if not, return to applying the medicine on the place where the medicine has not been applied and do not neglect it until your work is completed and the wound heals.
And then place a bandage on the wound with borders until the swelling of the abscess subsides, and then care for it with deficient ointment or another until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, in your work you must guard with vigilant diligence that nothing of the medicine falls into the wound, and if after several days the eyelid becomes soft and some cause of hairs sticks to the wound, then repeat your medicine on that place where the eyelid has become soft, and properly as you have done at the beginning, and then cover it until it is healed.
"And this is the form of a myrtle leaf.
"And know that the soles of men are varied according to size and smallness, and therefore your treatment is done accordingly.
"And do not hide the path of correctness from him who studies this art.
"Chapter XVII.
"About cauterizing a fistula that is in the tear duct of the eye.
"When you treat a fistula with the water that we have mentioned in the division of diseases and your treatment does not work, then you must cauterize it in this manner: order the patient to place his head on your lap, and let some minister hold the patient's head between your hands so that it is not moved or shaken by the patient’s head.
"And then place cotton wool soaked in egg white or in powdered pine nuts on his eye.
"And then heat the cautery, which is shaped as follows:
"which should be concave, like a reed or the feather of a vulture, with one end being the part used for cauterization.
"And if you wish, it may also penetrate into the other end. And if you wish it to be so, try.
But nevertheless, the one who is hollow (concave) is better for the tying work.
Then squeeze the fistula if it is open, and drain out of it blood and dry it up. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the pus from it.
Then place over it the cautery which is well lit, and with that you tie the hand a small distance from the cautery's handle at the nose's base, so that your hand does not err or disturb the patient, and then place the cautery in the nostril's grooves and burn it.
Therefore, if at the beginning of your cautery it enters into the bone, that is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if necessary; and leave it so for three days, and then place over it a bandage with oil and surround it with drying ointment until it heals.
But if ten days have passed and it is not healed, then place over it a sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed, and scrape it according to what is agreed upon in its chapter.
Based on the context and similarities to other Romance languages, here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And if the fistula is healed with the water we mentioned for the cautery and treatment, then it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to administer a potion through the nose and reduce the fistula back into the body of the nose according to its proper place.
### Chapter XVIII.
On the Cautery of Foot Fissures.
Many times these fissures occur in the lips, and most commonly in the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat these fissures with the water we mentioned in the previous sections and your treatment is not successful, then use a small pointed cautery according to this method which follows:
And let its concavity be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then place this carefully into those fissures until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures. xspace
And then treat it with cerotic ointments until it is healed.
### Chapter XIX.
On the Cautery of Fistulas in the Mouth.
When an abscess forms on the back of the palate or the palate itself, or between the teeth, and it bursts, and then becomes chronic, and runs pus and forms a fistula, and if you treat this and the treatment is not successful, then you should ignite the cautery according to the amount that has been received in the fistula, and place this burning into the opening of the fistula, keeping your hand on it until the heated iron reaches its depth. Do this once or twice; then treat it with the water we mentioned for treatment until it is healed.
And so if the wound is cut open and healed, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to uncover the area and remove the rotten bones according to what will be found in its chapter.
Chapter 20.
On the cautery of teeth and softening of veins.
When the veins are softened by humidity and the teeth are affected, and you treat them with medicines but they do not heal, then place the patient's head on your chest. Quickly light the cautery, which will be in the form that follows hereafter, and you should place the tip of it on the tooth, and insert the glowing cautery into it swiftly, holding it in such a way that the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth.
And then lift your hand, and then repeat the cautery several times as you wish.
And then the patient should rinse his mouth with salt water and keep it in for an hour, and then spit it out, because the affected tooth is fixed, and the softened gum is strengthened, and the corrupting moisture is dried up.
"Chapter 21.
"About cauterizing tooth pain.
"When tooth pain is caused by coldness or if there is a swelling or worm (infection), and you do not want to treat it with medicine, then cauterize it in two ways: either with cow's horn or with fire.
"Cauterizing with horn is done by taking cow's horn and putting it into hot ashes. Then take cotton and wrap it around the tip of the horn, then dip that wrapped in the heated horn, and place it on the painful tooth quickly until it becomes numb.
"And then repeat that several times until the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
"And if you prefer, soak wool or cotton in the heated horn as mentioned before, place it on the aching tooth, and then put hot iron on top until the heat reaches the bottom of the cavity.
"However, cauterizing with fire is done by using a reed or iron wire, and there should be some thickness in its center so that the heat of the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient.
And then heat the cautery to the shape of what is to come, and place it on the tooth while holding your hand until the cautery cools; and do this several times, for the pain will diminish either that day or the next.
And it is necessary that, through the application of this cautery, the patient fills his mouth with good water and holds it for an hour, and then spits it out; and this is the way to use the cautery.
And cauterize as much as you can manage according to your ability.
And this is the form of the cannula:
Chapter .22
On the Cauterization of Hernias.
When hernias are caused by phlegm and cold humors and do not respond to digestion through medicines, and you wish to proceed with a slight digestion of those, then heat the cautery in the following shape: it has two open ends so that smoke may escape from one end, and place the heated cautery on the hernia once, or twice if necessary, until it reaches the base of the hernia.
And if the hernia is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the hernia, and leave it for three days, and then place a cloth soaked in water over it until what the fire has burned is removed.
And then care for that person with ointments, bandages, and cloths until they are healed.
Chapter .23
On cauterizing the throat for voice loss and breathing difficulties.
When the humidity comes upon the channel of the lung, and especially when it is accompanied by coldness, then the patient should be evacuated at first with purgative medicines, and then you should cauterize that person on the vein of the throat in the depressed place.
And be careful not to pierce with the cautery into the throat or burn too much of its cords.
And then cauterize that person with another cautery on the joint of the neck in his last vertebra. And the cautery for this should be cupped according to the aforementioned method.
Then care for that person with the previously mentioned water until they are healed.
Chapter .24
On Cauterizing Lung Ailments and Coughing
When coughing and lung ailments are due to cold humors, the patient has no fever or phlegm, and it is an old ailment, then cauterize that person with two cauteries on the collarbone in the depressed places, one above and one below; and with another cautery in the middle of the sole between two toes; and let the cauteries be cupped according to the aforementioned shape.
And if you wish, let your cautery point be made with the pointed instrument called "punctum," the form of which precedes in the treatment of earache pain.
And let points be made into these areas; and then care for it with the previously mentioned method until it is healed.
And thus the pointed instrument should have three tips, because cautery is performed with it: in one application you can make three cauteries following this manner:
Chapter XXV.
On the cautery of the urethra, which is the head of the penis.
When the head of the penis is dislocated due to excessive lubrication and does not return to its place immediately upon its usual return, you must reduce this dislocation until it returns to its normal position. And with a slight movement it will be relocated as it should be, as we have observed. Therefore, it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation. Then, let the patient lie on his back or on one side; and then lift the scrotum, which is in the inner part of the penis, upwards with your left hand if the joint is dislocated to the inner parts.
And then heat the cautery which has two ends; this is its form:
And then cauterize the cord until it penetrates into the other side; and there will be a figure of four-ended cautery.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this account, and because there are eight cauteries.
Then place a porcelain cup filled with salt on the cautery, and then have the patient rest, so that the member is not moved for any time until it is comforted.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and it is done later, then cauterize over the muscle with a pointed cautery or with many pointed cauteries, because the joint is confirmed and the moisture is removed and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
On the Cauterization of the Stomach.
When cold and excessive moisture enters the stomach until it is expelled from its proper place and numerous rashes appear on him, and if you continue with the methods of care without success, then it is necessary for the patient to be placed on their back, extending their hands and feet, and then cauterize that area with three cauteries: one cautery below the feet, the size of a finger, with a pointed cautery, and two cauteries below both sides of the cautery, until you form a triangular figure; and make sure they are not too close together, as this will cause burning.
And if the depth of the cautery is equivalent to two-thirds of the thickness of the skin,
And let the shape of the cautery be according to this form without addition. If you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and let this be a circular cautery according to this form:
And let the stomach be punctured at that point which is most frightened by this cautery: and it is that you know on the stomach to prick according to the quantity that you want with a needle, and then cauterize that with a cautery in the points; and then cure that with the preceding care until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
On the coldness of the foot.
When pain in the foot occurs due to coldness or humidity or excess wind to the point of expelling its normal composition by superfluous exit, and the patient is cured with the water we have mentioned and not with a compress, then it is necessary that the patient be placed supine on their back. Prick three times with a needle according to this form and this quantity, placing them on the foot below the hypochondria, which is the man's decubitus position.
And let the space between each cautery be according to the thickness of the finger, and let the cauteries be along the length of the body straight.
And do not press with your hand on the cauteries too much.
And if the amount of water is equal to half the circumference of a codena (a unit of measurement), and it is not too tight; and if the patient stands on their feet; and if they are not standing, then let them sit down, having already extended their limbs and raised their arms.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a scalpel, when there is subtlety and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to press too much during the cauterization, and let the circumference of the entire codena be equal so that the whole body is covered and reaches into the intestines, because here the codena is subtle; and know this.
Chapter .28.
Of the puncturing of an abscess in the foot with a cautery.
When you want to open an abscess in the foot and wish to know whether that abscess is in the flesh of the foot or in its tunic, then if it is in the flesh of the foot, the patient will experience heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the tunic of the liver, with great pain that often wearies the doctors who try to cure it.
Therefore, it is necessary that the patient be turned onto their back; and then mark the location of the abscess with a cross; and then heat the pointed cautery which resembles a thorn, the shape of which is shown on the previous page. And cauterize with it and burn with that cautery until all the pus is burned away, until it reaches the bottom, until there is clear discharge.
Then treat the others in the same way for the treatment of other abscesses until they are healed.
And it is not necessary to use this type of cautery except that which has been studied in the art of medicine and which most sick people have known; but this one, after trying a few times, may be attempted for this operation, but nevertheless leave us that better one, and it is better.
Chapter XXIX
On the Cautery of Pleurisy
The ancients said that cautery for the causes of pleurisy should be done in this manner: that is, you take a long dry reed, thin and sharp, about the thickness of a finger.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text into English:
"And it is not necessary for you to press your hand with the cautery; instead, it should be in the open space of the wound.
"And some ancient people said that among those who use an iron cautery resembling a ray and igniting it, they placed it in the location between the ribs until it reached the abscess and expelled pus, as we have said about the foot abscess.
"However, in this perforation with a cautery there is danger, for one can die immediately if it happens in the location of an ulcer that has not healed.
It seems like you have provided just a chapter title ("Capitol .xxx.") without any text to translate. Please provide the next sentence or passage from the medieval medical treatise, and I'll be happy to help translate it into English.
"About the Cauterization of the Spleen.
"When you treat the illness of the spleen with the method we have mentioned for treatment in the division and your treatment does not help, then cauterize it according to three methods, all of which are appropriate. One of these is that you make three or four incisions along the length of the spleen, following the figure of the foot cauteries, the form of which has been previously mentioned.
And let there be between each cautery the thickness of a finger or a little more, and the manner of the cautery should be the same as we have mentioned for the cauteries on the leg likewise.
Do not press your hand with the cauteries; and let the patient lie on their back.
And there is another way to cauterize, which is to heat the cautery having two openings, as we have mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the muscle, and lift the cord that is at the place of the spleen so that the left side of the patient lies lower.
And let your elevation with which you lift the cord be according to the length of the body, so that the cauteries are made according to the width of the body.
Then quickly insert the two openings, heated well, into that opening through which you have passed the cord from the other side.
And then withdraw the cautery; and thus four cauteries are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three openings.
And then you must care for the cautery so that it does not fall off after many days, because this is more convenient than the other previously mentioned methods of treatment.
"Chapter 31.
"About Cauterization of Dropsy.
"Cautery does not work on those with dropsy, but rather on the liver specifically.
"When you treat a person with dropsy using the methods of treatment that we have mentioned in the division and your treatment does not work, then it is necessary for that person to be cauterized with four cauteries around the navel and one cautery on the stomach, and another on the chest, and another on the spleen, and two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, and one cautery on the right foot, and another on the stomach. "And the depth of the cautery should be appropriate to the thickness of the skin.
"And then leave the cautery open so that it can drain for a long time.
"And do not evacuate the patient of their treatment immediately after the cautery with water that is necessary, for two reasons: it will hasten the healing process.
"The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be triangular according to its previously mentioned form, and it should be olive-shaped for the back as described above.
### Translation: Chapter XXXII
### Translation: On Cautery of the Feet and Hips.
### Translation: When the feet are swollen with dropsy and filled with water, you should cauterize the feet on the back of the foot, specifically in the area between the little finger and the ring finger, and elevate your hand with the cautery without twisting it; then elevate your hand further and do not lower it completely, because the saturated water will flow out.
### Translation: Perform the cautery in this manner: And then on both hips make two cauteries, and on each hip let there be a cautery with the cutting end of the cautery knife. ### Translation: And the cautery should be according to the length of the hip: one below the knee and the other in the middle of the hip; and on each hip, two cauteries.
### Translation: And leave the wound open without care for a long time so that no water comes out of it.
### Translation: And then treat it with those remedies which we have mentioned.
### Translation: Chapter XXXIII
### Translation: On Cautery of the Abdomen
When the abdomen is affected by cold and moisture to the point of debility in the virtues, it affects the digestive and retentive virtues located in the stomach and intestines. It is treated with methods of healing and not with diet, and sometimes the patient suffers from the exertion of virtue, then cauterize that with a large cautery on their stomach according to what has been said earlier about cauterizing the stomach, with a circular cautery and four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a clavicle subtle cautery; and with a cautery over the ribs, either one large or two.
And if sometimes the humors are excessive and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize them on the pubic area and intestines, and arrange two cauteries strongly on the stomach near the inguinal region, because this is a perfect cure for which there is no error.
Chapter .XXXIV.
Of cauterizing old hemorrhoids.
When there is a nature behind old hemorrhoids or one of thick cold humors or corrupt moisture, and they are healed with what we have said in the division and not with dietary treatment, then cauterize with three cauteries below the small of the back near the spine, which are small and triangular, and a cautery above the navel that is passed through two fingers.
Here's the line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
**Capítulo XXXV.**
**Sobre la cauterización del estómago cerca de sus abscesos.**
**Cuando abres el estómago, entonces calientas el cauterio que se parece a un rayo.** **Luego, introduce ese fuego en el estómago abierto y continúa con tu mano hasta que el cauterio llegue a la abertura de la vena de la cual sale la sangre.**
**Y hazlo una o dos veces, porque si son muchos, entonces cauteriza cada uno de ellos según lo que hemos mencionado, y luego cura esos con algo de los ungüentos hasta que esté sanado.**
**Y si cauterizas con un gran cauterio en la piel, el efecto curativo será más duradero.**
**Capítulo XXXVI.**
**Sobre la cauterización de fistulas hechas en la naturaleza debido a su división en partes.**
**Cuando la naturaleza no obedece al trabajo que hemos recomendado en su lugar, y el paciente está asustado por esto, entonces sánese con cauterio.**
**Por lo tanto, cuando alguien tiene una fistula en la naturaleza debido a su antigüedad, fluye pus y humedades corrompidas. Entonces lo que es más digno de hacer es probarlo con una aguja delgada, y luego conozca la profundidad de él con la mencionada aguja.** ️
Then heat the cautery that resembles a ray. Then place this heated cautery on this fistula, and according to the quantity in which you enter the tip.
And repeat this process with the cautery until those corrupt bodies are completely burned, once or twice or three times, depending on your need.
And be careful not to burn the nerves or the veins; or if the fistula goes towards the bladder or the belly, then be careful of all those places; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy and thick place that does not penetrate.
Then care for the area until it is healed.
And if the area is closed, and all the matter has been removed from it, and it remains that way for a long time, then you know that it has been completely cured.
And if the matter is not removed from it, then you know that it is penetrating into the marrow of the bone or has fallen into one of those causes which will remind you of its place.
Chapter .xxxvii.
On the Cautery of Haemorrhoids.
When haemorrhoids cause pain due to cold or excessive flatulence, and for this reason the patient's anus is dried out, then you should cauterize that area on the haemorrhoids with a cautery on each haemorrhoid, using a needle from which we take the reminder.
And with a strong and light touch of the second cautery, a little bit lower, so that three lined cauteries will come, and then they will be more behind in support.
Capítulo .xxxviii.
Sobre la cauterización de la vejiga.
Cuando ocurre debilidad y ablandamiento de la vejiga por frío y humedad, de modo que el paciente no puede retener la orina, entonces caucezare en la parte más baja sobre la vejiga, donde comienzan los vellos del pene. Y caucerize con un cauterio en el lado derecho y otro en el izquierdo de él.
Y la longitud de cada cauterio sea según la cantidad de las venas del escroto; y caucerize con un cauterio en la parte más baja de la espalda, o con dos cauterios si es necesario.
Y el cauterio sea agudo según el procedimiento adecuado.
Capítulo .xxxix.
Sobre la cauterización del útero.
Cuando el útero está afectado por frío y humedad, lo que impide el embarazo, y las mestruaciones se corrompen y son retrasadas, y hay dolor durante la menstruación, entonces el área debe ser cauterizada con tres cauterios alrededor del ombligo, como hemos dicho en la cauterización de la vejiga; y con un cauterio en la parte más baja de la espalda, o con dos cauterios, y que el cauterio sea agudo.
**Capítulo 40**
Sobre el cauterio para tratar la luxación del tobillo.
Cuando las mucosidades húmedas se infiltran en la articulación del tobillo, causando su desplazamiento del lugar original, el signo de esto es que una parte se extiende más que la otra cuando se comparan entre sí. El lugar de la luxación se encuentra en lo que se conoce como el "bajo".
Entonces debes cauterizar al paciente sobre la articulación del tobillo con un cauterio en forma de círculo, ya que habrás notado con la prueba en el círculo de la articulación cómo se revuelve, y para que la articulación caiga en el centro del círculo.
Y el cauterio del cual procede tiene la misma forma que el cauterio utilizado para tratar el estómago.
Y si este cauterio no está disponible para ti, entonces cauteriza con tres cauterios con un gran cauterio de aceituna.
Y el cauterio se realiza en función del tamaño total de la cadena; y luego cuida ese área para que sane por completo.
Chapter 41
Of the Cauterization of the Sciatic Vein
When pain occurs in the ankle area and is caused by coldness and moisture, the patient should be treated with the water we have mentioned earlier. If this does not help, it means that the patient's humors are heavy. In this case, you must remove these humors from the patient using stinking pills or artificial pills; then cauterize the affected area.
And there are two methods of cauterization in this case: either with burning medicine or with fire.
According to two known methods, one of which involves making three triangular-shaped cautery marks on the ankle area of the patient, ensuring that they are well deep. And the space between each triangular-shaped cautery mark should be the width of a finger, whether the cautery is almond-shaped or larger.
However, sometimes the cauteries can also be placed in the middle of the ankle, making four in total.
And if you wish, you can also cauterize with a circle, as in the case of ankle dislocation, ensuring that the circle is continuous and burns the tip of the entire tendon.
This is the method of using a pointed cautery when pain is present on the surface and does not extend into the body.
But if the pain extends into the body, then use two pointed cauteries on the body over the area where the patient indicates the pain is, and one pointed cautery on the heel four fingers away from the sole of the foot.
And if it's a knife-cautery, let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the cord.
And if the patient indicates that the pain is extended to a place near the toes, then use the pointed cautery there where indicated with three or four points or more as needed.
And if the patient indicates that the pain is beneath the knee towards the body, then use a knife-cautery there.
And be careful in all cautery that you do not go too deep with the cautery so as to burn nerves or large blood vessels, and thus cause harm or damage to the patient.
And I have seen one and another of those who cauterized on the heel and went too deep in the cautery, so that the foot swelled up until the tumor reached the foot, and it was pierced and rotted the entire foot. And then immediately follows a strong solution of the abdomen, and then death occurs.
And if the pain is in two parts at once, cauterize each one according to this manner.
And the wise men say about the cauterization of water: use an iron of which this is the manner: make it similar to a circle of iron, whose circumference should be half the length of a palm; and let its orifices be according to the thickness of a fingertip or less.
And inside that circle should be another third [circle]; and the space between them should be the width of a finger's nail; and let those circles be open on two sides; and the length of those irons should be one finger's width or two, and make those iron edges neatly fitted into the circles; and this is its shape.
Then let it be ignited in the fire until it becomes red and throws off sparks, and then place it on the watery part, with the patient lying on his side. And therefore, cauterize that with three round cauteries in one go.
And then leave it for three days; then bandage it with linen and leave the wound open for several days; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Al-Zahrawi says: "O my sons, we rarely use this type of cautery because of the fear of complications and because few people are skilled in performing it.
It seems like there might be some errors or missing words in the provided text, but based on what is given, here's a possible translation:
Certainly! Let's translate the text line by line:
And if the spaces that are between each quantity of the thickness of the finger are opened from below and above, they should contain themselves within them according to this form.
And then press on the affected part of the ankle while the patient lies on their side, and place your hand on the affected part of the ankle. Then take some hot water and pour it between two circles, and let that water heat up gradually with a small fire. Keep this up for about one hour, until the patient can bear the burning and swelling — because this remedy burns like fire — until the burning subsides.
And then lift your hand with the instrument and wash away all the hot water from the ankle with cold water.
And then let it rest for three days and place something on the border until the blackness of the swelling is reduced, and let it rest for several more days, and a scab will form; this is the last stage of healing.
And then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends into the thigh or leg, make for him a statue that contains water in the same way as is done with the ankle.
And this is the way of hot water treatment, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the correction of medicines. Recipe of alkali and chalk mixed in equal parts, then crush them and place them in a new vessel with the top perforated by a small hole according to the amount that enters the patient's vein.
Then place another vessel underneath the first one, and pour over the alkali and chalk living water, which covers them by about an inch. After you compress them with your hand for good compression, allow the vessel to let out the acute water into the second vessel below.
Then adjust all that water and pour it over renewed chalk and alkali, because at this time it will be of very great acuity, which is administered in many medical operations and in the cauterization of other members, for it has a burning effect.
And thus with some of the medicines with which it is cauterized, such as pitch and honey and chalk mixed with soap.
And a certain man of the ancients recounted the operation and treatment with which pain of water and sciatica are cured, and he said that this is very good, and stated that no other treatment is necessary, because it is cured once and for all, as he recounts. For when one enters the bath, one is already free from that.
And it should be taken from certain fresh nettles, and if no nettle is found, then take a fresh fig; and both should be crushed with a little gray salt and placed on the painful spot, whether it is in the armpit, groin, or thigh, and bound.
And let it remain for a duration of three hours, or for however long the patient feels relief from the pain.
Then have him enter a bath, and once his body is reddened by the heat, remove him from the water because the pain will cease and he will be healed.
And know that it is not necessary to use cautery with these medications, except for the purpose of purging the body.
However, Dioscorides said that when the straight vein is cauterized with goat fat, it benefits one more; and let the cautery be done in this manner: take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it between the toes of the foot and the sole.
Then take dry goat fat and burn it with fire until it becomes charcoal; then place it on the wool, making sure it is spread out evenly. Then repeat this process, and do not stop doing so until the sensation of biting reaches into the armpit and relieves the pain.
And this manner of using a cautery is called "cauterium vacuum.
Chapter XLIV
On the Cauterization of Back Pain
Sometimes back pain occurs due to various causes, such as a fall, a blow, or excessive evacuation, and similar causes, due to the infusion of cold, wet material.
And cautery is only performed in this specific case that is caused by an infusion of cold material.
Therefore, first evacuate the patient with pills and similar remedies, made on the back where the pain is three lines wide according to their size, since in each line there should be ten or more cauteries, depending on the patient's tolerance and their strength.
And let the cautery be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries in a linear arrangement like this:
Chapter XLV
On the Cauterization at the Beginning of Jaundice
This disease often affects young children, and the sign of its beginning in children is that their body becomes rigid and motionless.
And you find in the lower vertebra of the back and the buttocks that it has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
And therefore when you see this and wish to prevent it, then cauterize that area with a cautery that is circular according to this form: which takes the cautery evenly over the entire vertebra.
And if you wish, cauterize around the circumference of the vertebra with a pointed cautery two or three times. And let the points be placed closely together.
And then treat the area until it is healed with what we have said.
But beware that a cautery is not administered on a swelling that is caused by a nerve spasm. 
Chapter XLIV
On the Cauterization of Gout and Joint Pain
When joint pains are caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pains occur in the feet, doctors usually call this gout specifically.
And therefore when gout caused by cold is cured with a method of treatment and the pains are not relieved, then you should cauterize again.
And you should cauterize that area near the joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And it should be a cautery made of olive wood, which is shaped as follows:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And if the pains rise into the teeth or other joints, and this happens many times, then cauterize each tooth with three or four cauteries from all sides with this olive wood cautery.
And if many cauteries are needed, then perform the cautery with these cauteries, and do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery beforehand, but only enough to see the shape of the point.
And if the pains rise into the tooth and the back, then administer the cautery which we have mentioned in its chapter.
And if the pains are only in the hands, and it is called arthritis, then make points along the edge of the fingers as follows: make points along those two lines.
And if pains remain in the said places, then make points around the edge of each finger and on the palm of the hand.
And if the pain persists for several days in the shoulders or muscles, then cauterize all parts of the assistants.
And do not empty the patient of good management and reception of medicines, because if proper management is done and heat is evacuated with this cautery, he will be cured, God helping.
Chapter 45.
Of the cauterization of ruptures.
When there is a rupture in the intestines and the bowels protrude before the hernia, and this begins to happen, then you should command the patient to cease his food for the day and to use gentle causes so that the opening of his belly does not widen.
Then follow the patient between your hands on his back, and command him to keep his breath until it is forced out or the hernia or bowels appear.
Then return to him with these words and signs, attempting the rupture on the bones of the pelvis, at the signal where the end is similar to half a circle in the upper parts of the body.
Then heat the cautery which has this form:
Here's my attempt at translating "entro que sia mot rog e gete cintilhas": Here's my best guess at translating this line into English:
This sentence appears to be describing a process involving patient care and the use of cushions or pillows. Here's a line-by-line translation:
E then place the cautery on that mark with your hand holding the cautery straight, and thrust so that with it you can reach the bone of the big toe in the middle of the toe; and repeat this again if you have not reached the bone in the first attempt.
And be careful not to burn the intestine during your cauterization, so that the patient does not die or suffer other serious consequences.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation will be in vain.
And it is important that the cautery for children be suitable according to their age and size.
Then care for the cauterized area for three days with linen until the scab of the fire has fallen off.
And then treat it with other ointments until it is healed.
And let the patient lie on their back for forty days, until the place and the wound are sealed.
And it is necessary to give the patient food according to the length of time of their treatment, so that their stomach does not become empty and the intestine does not come out due to the effort of healing.
And when one wishes to get up after about 40 days, then administer a well-prepared ointment, and have them keep it on for another 40 days.
And let them be restricted from work and excessive eating and drinking, as well as loud voices, for when they follow this complete course of treatment, they will be healed.
And I will discuss the treatment of ruptures in other parts of the abdomen, and at the beginning, if you want them to stop, then cauterize that rupture with a circular cautery according to its size, and let it be as dry as possible; and then treat it with what we have said, and it will not burst.
And some people say that ruptures should be cauterized with a triangular cautery like this, because it is marked with a needle:
and a line is drawn through the width on each side of the rupture, and another line above it; and place your hand with a nail-shaped cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46
On Cauterizing Hernias
When pain in certain members persists due to injury or impact, and that pain continues for a long time without responding to treatment with medicines, then you must use a pointed cautery for cauterization.
And let the size of the cautery correspond to the magnitude and smallness of the member, its strength and weakness, and the location of the twist and pain.
Therefore, if the first cauterization heals it, that is good; otherwise, repeat the cauterization on it; for it is customary for those pains to spread from one member to another nearby, so you must capture all of them with the cautery until the patient is cured.
Chapter 47.
Of the Cauterization for Leprosy.
Some lepers benefit greatly from cauterization, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And so when you want to cauterize that (leper), consider if the leprosy is common and that type has been cured with water as we have said in the division, and neither say nor think this, and fear for the patient that the corruption may spread throughout his body and all of him, then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and the second below it, towards the hairline of the forehead; and two on the temples; and one at the back, on the nape or occiput.
And finally, with the cautery in your hand, press a little into the bone to make a slight impression, and remove the scabs from it so that the expulsion of gross vapors is relieved from him; and cauterize over the spleen as necessary.
And if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and appears manifestly, then you should cauterize him with those cauteries which we have mentioned on the head; and cauterize on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on both temples, and with two cauteries on the two cervical vertebrae, and with six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and with a large one on the vertebrae near the coccyx, and one on the coccyx itself, and with two on each ankle, and one on each heel, and with two on the soles of the feet, and one on each sole, and with two on the elbows, and with two on the shoulders, and with two on the palms of his hands; and cauterize on all the joints of the fingers of his hands and feet, and on each heel of his feet, and on the balls of his toes.
And be careful of the nerves that are on the soles [of the feet], so that you do not burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the bone of the knee and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the groin.
And know that the more precisely you apply the cauteries, the more beneficial and effective they will be; and know that the patient does not feel pain in the cauteries as others do, because their body is already numbed.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large or small according to the members and joints, as previously specified in the tools' specifications.
Then care for the cautery with a mixture of barley flour and honey, and apply the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter XLVIII
On Cauterization for Paralysis
When any member is paralyzed or numb and has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters but does not heal, then you should cauterize that paralyzed member with a cautery according to the size of the member, whether it is large or small.
And let your cautery enter the spine slightly. Then care for that with an ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes paralysis is cauterized in the places where the nerves emerge that move that member, and the paralysis is removed.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
Capitulo (or chapter) XLVII
About the cauterization of warts, which is a blemish.
When warts are old and you do not apply any of the medicinal ointments to them, then cauterize that area with a pointed cautery for a short while, just enough so that the whiteness and color of it are removed and its color is changed.
And then treat it with a mixture of barley flour and lentils, mixed with rose oil and rowan leaves, and either pigeon blood or hawk's blood, each in equal parts and all well mixed together. Then soak a cloth in this and place it on the spot until it is healed.
Chapter I
On the Cauterization of Cancer.
When cancer begins and you wish to stop it, then cauterize that area with a circular cautery along its circumference as it extends.
And the wise have said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle of the spot; but I have not seen this, for I fear that it will become ulcerated, and I have seen this happen sometimes.
And it is more appropriate to cauterize around the edge of the spot with a circle as we have said, or with many cauteries.
"Chapter 2.
"On the cauterization of an abscess.
"When an abscess is delayed in ripening, and this is due to the abundance of fluid causing it, or due to the patient's condition, as they are old and frail, or have little blood, or due to the time, and you wish to hasten the ripening of the abscess; then cauterize around it with several small pointed cauteries; and afterwards let it be left alone for it will hasten in ripening.
"But if you wish to pierce it with a cautery, then heat the cautery of which this is the form, and place it in the middle of the abscess until it penetrates through.
"And if the cautery is in that place which is lowest, in order to relieve the body of the arm; and afterwards care for it until it heals.
"Chapter 22.
"On the cauterization of a ulcer.
"A ulcer is a corruption walking on the limb, which corrupts it in the same way as fire consumes dry wood.
"Therefore, if you see that ulcer in a place suitable for cautery with fire, then heat several pointed cauteries of few and large size, as is appropriate for that place where the ulcer is.
And then cauterize thoroughly until you have completely removed all corrosion and there is no longer any cause of it.
And then leave it for three days, and place over the cauterized areas a salve made of oil mixed with salt until all the scabs are removed and all corruption is eliminated.
And then treat it with flesh-growing ointment.
But if after three days the flesh grows healthy without corruption, that is good; but if not, then repeat the cautery on the areas where there is still corruption.
And the corrosive condition is treated with sharp medicine because that serves as a substitute for cauterization. But however, cauterization by fire is a lighter and faster remedy.
And I have already spoken about the treatment of it with sharp medicine in the division, so take that when you need to begin [the treatment].
Chapter 53
On Cauterizing Wounds and Similar Conditions
Many times it is seen in the parts below the sick foot that are called wounds, which is a severe and deep opening that afflicts the foot; and there are two ways to cauterize these: cautery by fire and cautery by hot water.
Here's the line-by-line translation:
And then place that instrument on the nail, and then rotate your hand with the cautery around the nail until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail. And let it be for three days until the pus begins to flow. And then apply that with wild mallow crushed in salt, and let the plaster stay on it for one night, because that will root out its causes.
And then cure the area with an ointment of fresh meat until it is healed.
And if it is not converted, and many ulcers occur on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then you should administer cautery with water to those places. And take a small tube of bronze or iron or feather of vulture, and place it over the nail; and then pour into the tube a little hot water, and hold your hand, and rotate that with pressure from your whole hand, and press the edge of the tube into the root of the nail, and the hot water will find its way to the root of the nail; and wait for the patient to feel the bite of the hot water for an hour, and then remove it, because the nail with its causes will be eradicated.
And thus he did with them all, one after another, treating each of their parts.
Then he cures those [parts] afterwards, since the roots of the nails have been eradicated by the water of ointments that the flesh generates.
Chapter 43.
Of Cautery for Tremors.
When someone has a tremor due to cold in the nerves or fever from a similar cause, it is necessary for you to cauterize them with four cauteries or five on the vertebrae of their back, placing one cautery between each vertebra; and with a cautery on their feet, and on their stomach, using an olive-shaped cautery.
And their tremor will cease, hastening the healing of the cold disease.
Chapter 55.
Of Cautery for Swelling Incidents in the Body.
When there are swellings in the body, and pustules that burst open, formed of thick, corrupt materials, it is necessary at first appearance to cauterize the top of each fistula with a thin cautery, with a myrtle stick, the end of which is extended with fire; or with long, sharp roots; or with lenticular cauteries.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
"But it is important that this be done after an evacuation with phlebotomy.
"Chapter 56.
"On the Cautery for Bleeding from a Bow-shot Wound.
"If a soldier is seen bleeding from an arrow wound that has been cut outside the injury, or if there is an incision of abscesses or cautery of the limb, and it appears similar, then it is difficult for him to recover.
"So when something like this happens to someone, then you must quickly cover the opening of the arrow wound with your hand, and press firmly on it until the bleeding stops, and it does not come out.
"And then place the olive-wood cauteries, both small and large, in the fire, by the number of wounds, and blow on them until they are quite red hot.
"And then take one of these, small or large according to the place and wound where the artery has been cut; quickly apply it to that vein after you have removed your hand, and press the cautery until the blood is sealed and constricted.
"And if the blood is expelled from the opening of the artery when you remove your hand and extract the cautery, then immediately take another cautery from among those prepared in the fire, and continue doing this one after another until the bleeding is stopped.
And be careful not to burn the nerves that are here, and that another illness comes upon the patient.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to stop the bleeding in those [cases], especially when the artery is large, except by one of these four methods: either with a pointed cautery as we have said, or by extraction if it has not yet been extracted, for when it is extracted, its ends are burnt and the blood flow is reduced, or let it be tied with fat or ligature by strong constriction, or medicines that have the power to restrict blood flow should be placed on it; and they should be strengthened with a pillow and decent constriction.
But one who administers restraint with a ligature and constriction with cloth or due to the position of burning causes and similar ones, should not be concerned except tardily.
But if this is needed for someone and neither the physician nor medicine is present, then act with the said finger over the orifices of that vein as we have said, and understand to apply great constriction to it so that the blood is stopped from the main part of the wound, and above the artery the said should not be removed; and over the artery let cold water be poured until the blood is frozen and thickened; and think about what is necessary for cautery or medicine.
Of incision and puncture, of cupping and phlebotomy, of wounds, and their similarities.
In the first chapter, we have mentioned all diseases in which it is appropriate to use a hot cautery and combustible medicines, along with their causes and necessary instruments, including the shapes of cauteries; and I have arranged the chapters from the top of the head down to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the seeker may be relieved when asking about it.
And before I begin this, you must learn, son, that in this chapter is all that was in the first chapter on cautery.
And because it is necessary to have great caution in this, for the operation which is often seen in this chapter, that is, bloodletting with which life resides, you must be careful of the cutting or incision on an abscess, or the opening of a fistula, or the cleaning of a wound, or the extraction of an arrow or stone and their similarities. And of all those (conditions), fear and trembling accompany them, and in the worst cases, death.
And I warn you that such a thing should not happen to you, for sometimes it happens that people with mental illness behave like those who are very ill. And some of them will go away with their illness and will die easily because of the intensity of what they find in their illness, and because of the length of their illness, and there is a fear that this signifies death.
And some of those are the ones who give you their property and goods, and you expect health from them, but their illness is harmful.
Therefore, you should not consent to what comes to you from such people; and your caution should be greater than your desire and greed; and do not presume any cause for this unless you have certain knowledge that validates it, and which will lead to a praiseworthy outcome.
And use in the care of all your sick the prognosis and indication of one who is cured, for in that you will find help in acquiring fame and memory, praise and glory.
O, sons, may God inspire in you His understanding and not take away your direction and protection, for that is in His hand.
And I have ordered this chapter to be distinguished by sections, following the section on cauteries, from the head to the feet, so that what you ask for and need may be alleviated for you.
Chapter One.
On the treatment of water retained in a child's head.
Know that this illness often happens to children after birth and when the nurse tightly binds the child's head without leaving any space.
And sometimes it happens due to hidden causes which are not known.
However, I have not seen this illness in anyone except children; and all those whom I saw died from it, and for this reason I consider it to be fatal.
And I have seen that a child whose head was full of water had such a large head that he could not sit down because of its size, and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture is either added between the skin and the bone, or it is added below the bone on the brain.
When the operation is such that the moisture is between the skin and bone, and the abscess is small, then you should cut into the middle of the head with a slit in the length, and let the length of the slit be two nights until it drains the moisture. This is the form of the spatula:
And therefore, if the moisture has increased and the abscess is larger, then there should be two slits according to this manner:
And if the moisture is underneath the bone, the sign of this is that you will see the commissures of the head open on all sides and the water is squeezed out when you press it with your dry hand inside and it does not hide anything from you. It is necessary that you cut into the middle of the head with three slits in this manner:
Then extract all the moisture from the incision; then strengthen the slits with cloths and poultices; then cover it with a mixture of wine and oil for five days, then remove the bandage and treat the wound with dressings and ointments, and strengthen the head with equal parts; and feed the patient with dry food of little moisture until the member is comforted and healed.
And there is another method of incision, which consists in observing where the abscess appears and the collection of water, because sometimes it is more in the occiput or in the front part, or on the right side, or on the left side; and thus pay attention to the incision where the abscess and the accumulation of water appear, and do that as best you can.
And be careful not to cut the artery, as it may cause bleeding and the patient may die from that blood loss along with the evacuation of fluids.
Chapter Three
When there is some catarrh or rupture in the eyes or feet, and this is old and not benefiting from medical treatments, then the last resort for this is to make an incision of those two arteries.
Therefore, it is necessary that when you want to incise those [arteries], the patient should raise his head, and then rub the area with rough cloth so that the arteries become apparent. And then strengthen the neck of the patient with some cloth; and then consider where the vein pulsates; and press on the locations corresponding to the locations near the ears until they are hidden under the skin in some men.
Certainly! Let's translate the provided sentence step-by-step:
And if you wish, insert the spatula below the artery and break that which is causing the pain on the affected area.
And let the length of the incision be twice the thickness (or diameter) of the said vessel, for when any vein is cut, the blood comes out with a pulsating flow, which jumps out frequently.
However, if the artery is not visible on the skin, then you should measure from the ear the amount of space corresponding to three fingers, and then proceed with a probe, and find the bone.
And the amount of blood that should be let out is one-sixth of a measure (or about 120 ml), and pour it out gently, neither too much nor too little, and all this depends on the strength of the patient and the fullness of their artery.
And then consider the wound, and therefore if there is any bone fragment remaining on the bone, cut it away so that a dry abscess does not form.
And then strengthen the wound with compresses and linen bandages, and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter III
On the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
When someone has an old migraine or severe headache due to humoral imbalances and the qualities of the temples' vessels, or if they have a persistent and intense old pain similar to these, and it is treated with the methods of medicine but does not improve, then we resort to these extraction procedures in the temples, or cauterization of those areas as we have shown.
And the method for performing this operation and extraction is that the patient shaves the hairs on their temples; then he must locate the apparent artery in the temple, which is shown to you by its pulse, and it is hidden except in a few people due to great cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then tighten the patient's neck with some cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or apply warm water to the area until the artery becomes clearly visible to you. And then take the spatula, which looks like this: Then you scrape the skin with it until you reach the artery; and then insert a needle into it and extract it in several stages until you remove it from the vein and reveal the membranes that cover it completely.
Sure, I'll do my best to translate this sentence:
And then evacuate some of the blood, one to three times.
And if the wound is large, then it is necessary for you to bind it in two places with a double-layered bandage or with long cords, and do not let it become infected before the wound heals and prevent bleeding.
Then cut away the excess that is between two ligaments, and do this at that time or shortly after.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone with a sharp cautery until its edges are cut off, and it will remain in place of that same work.
And it is better work if the patient has a fever or is of a hot temperament; because cautery is of those causes that help the dissolving humors, and therefore it is better in summer.
And it is also necessary for the removal of wounds to fill the place with old cotton, and let them be placed on him properly made poultices, and then heal it with dry medicines that make the flesh grow, and with compresses until he is healed.
And if during the operation it happens that there is bleeding from the wound, then you should be careful to stop that blood, either with a cautery or by filling the place with cotton, and press your hand until the blood stops. Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
Let's translate the text line by line:
And this is the form of the cautery:
And it should be the sharpness of two similar knives. However, if it has less sharpness than two knives, it is better because if they are as sharp as two knives, you might quickly cut the flesh near each joint.
Therefore, because in those [cases with less sharpness], there is some thickness, the heat of the fire is retained in them and the flesh is slightly cut.
And this work is better in all ways and lighter too.
And the space should be the thickness of a finger between two knives.
Chapter four.
On the care for the body with sharp and acid tears from the eyes.
When tears are acidic and affect those veins on the surface of the head outside, do not apply any medical treatment to it. Sometimes the patient's face turns red, and they feel an itching sensation on their forehead as if it were caused by ants. In such cases, the eyes become exhausted, so much so that even the hair is affected, and the eyelids are scratched by the sharpness of the tears. The ancient physicians used this operation in the treatment of these conditions and named this treatment "spassa".
And it is that you command the patient to shave the hairs on their forehead, and then you cut three equally spaced incisions across the forehead according to its length. And if the length of the incision is two fingers: let one incision be equally distant from the tip of the nose to the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little beyond the corners of the eyes, and the third on the other side.
And beware of the incisions of the arteries that are on both sides, and extend your hand along the continuation of both jaws. And if the space of each incision is three fingers wide.
And if you have a compress of dry sponge or clean cloth with which to wipe away the blood.
And then insert the speculum with two sharp ends, this is how its incision should be: which starts from the temples to the second incision. Use the instrument to scoop out all of the dura mater (tough membrane) that is between the two incisions and over the bone, and then do the same from the middle incision to the second incision. And then proceed into this space and introduce another instrument for the first time, which is called a scalpel, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
Then place the sharp edge against the flesh next to the spine, and the blunt edge on the bone. Insert this instrument until it reaches the middle split, and with that, cut all the vessels that descend from the head down to the heels.
But if the incision has reached as far as the spine, then make another incision in the middle split until you reach the other split.
And since a quantity of blood has flowed out, compress the places of the bleeding vessels with a sponge.
Then place on each split a piece of old cloth, and place over those cloths powdered with wine and oil and vinegar, and make sure that an abscess does not form.
And on the third day, remove the bandage and administer a large infusion of hot water or tea, and then treat it with an ointment made of basilicum oil and rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5
About the care of tears through catharsis and from the parts inside the head.
When someone has acute and continuous catharsis, and sometimes the patient's eyes are small and exhausted, and their sight is weakened, and the eyelids are ulcerated and lose their hair, and there is sharp pain and subsequent protrusion on the forehead of the head, then know by these signs that the substances and catharsis come from the tiny vessels within.
And the best treatment for them is this: order the patient to shave their forehead, and then make an incision in it at its middle point, a small one (and begin with the left temple incision towards the right; and let the incision reach the bone; and keep your hand away from the temples' sinews which are bad for chewing), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth, and then fill between the two lips of the incision with old cotton or linen rags. And then cover it with powder mixed in wine and oil, so that it does not become an inflamed abscess.
Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts and translate it step by step:
Sure, I can help you with that. Please provide me with the text for Chapter VI (Capitol .vi.) so that I can assist you in translating it line by line into English.
Of the care of those who suffer from earache.
Every cause that afflicts the ears is one of four types: either it is a mineral stone or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as thistle or bean; or it is a fluid cause, such as water and vinegar and their likenesses; or some animal.
And therefore when a stone or other similar cause from those causes that do not fit or grow in the ear is present, and you place the ear towards the sun, and if you see the stone, then distill onto it some oil of lily or cumin, and then administer the extraction of it, and make them sneeze with conditions, and open the nostrils for the purpose of sneezing. Then place around the circumference of the ear some weights of cloth or wool, and extend the ear to the sides above, because when it is observed that these causes are expelled with these means.
And if it is not expelled, then administer the extraction of it with an instrument called a fine epicyclical tweezers, the form of which is this:
And if it is forgotten during the incision, it's good; otherwise, administer the extraction of it with a subtle ounce and a double dose of little.
And if it is not forgotten by this, then make a needle from iron and insert the end of the needle into the hole of the ear, and close around the needle with wax and softened oil so that nothing but the needle is open. And then extract it with your breath using strong suction, because you will see that what we have mentioned works.
But if it is not forgotten in this manner, then take a piece of alum or white lead with which birds are caught, a small quantity, and place it on the tip of the ray, and then wrap a clean cloth over that well-placed end. And then insert it into the hole of the ear with ease, and then dry the ear from moisture.
And if it is not forgotten with all the causes that we have mentioned, then you should cut it before it becomes an abscess or spasm.
And the way to cut it is that you bleed the patient from the saphenous vein and extract blood according to the strength of the patient, then make the incision between your hands and turn the ear to its parts above, and make a small slit in the margin of the ear near the place where it is most pressed. And if the lunar incision is open until it reaches the stone, and the stone is found, remove it with appropriate instruments; then close the incision immediately, and heal it until it is cured.
And if the cause in the ear is one of the fats that grows and swells, then administer the treatment and extraction of it; but if it does not obey you at first, then take a thin spatula according to this manner: and use that (spatula) to extract the fat from the ear.
And do not perform this when you think that it has already been softened by the ear's vapor, and place a weight on it, and then extract it from there with tweezers or a thin instrument, or by incision as we have said, because its extraction is made easier.
But in the case of water that has entered the ear, it is necessary for the patient to use sneezing with conditions at the beginning, and fill their ear with some old cloth, and beat on that ear where the water is, and if by this it is driven out, good; and if not, then take several thin pebbles and lemons according to the length of the finger, and heat them a little in the fire, and let the patient insert one of these into the hole of their ear and jump on one foot of that side and strike with another pebble on the pebble inside the ear. "Therefore, do not cease [applying pressure] with a stone until all the water has been evacuated.
"Therefore, do not cease [applying pressure] with a stone until all the water has been evacuated. "And once the water has been evacuated, take a piece of paper or cloth and put one end in the ear, then extend the other end with fire until it is completely burned.
"Then put another cloth in and do this as many times as necessary until all the water has been evacuated, and then use a cannula just as it was mentioned above for the extracting stone.
"But in the extraction of an animal entering that ear, if it is a small creature and similar to a flea, cure it as we have said in the division; but if it is a large creature that causes swelling inside the ear, then administer the extraction with tweezers and scissors, and the cause will be lighter than all the other causes entering the ear.
"But in the extraction of a worm born in the ear, when you cure it with the water we mentioned in the division and in the treatise on distillations, if your cure is not successful, then you must observe the ear towards the sun.
And therefore, if any cause of worms appears here, then extract it with a hook or with thin needles. But if no cause appears, then take a cannula that is narrow at the end and wide in the middle, which has this form: And insert the thin end into the ear according to the amount that the patient can tolerate; then suck out strongly with it, and do this many times until all the worms are removed.
But if it does not work according to your expectation, then you should fill and seal the circumference of the cannula with wax as we have said; then administer distilled preparations that have already been tested by the ancients for the treatment of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your infusion be with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear using this instrument, of which this is the form: And make it out of silver or copper, narrow in shape, with a small hole at one end and flat on top.
And therefore it should be filled to the point where it fits into the cavity of the cannula, as will be necessary. And if you wish, take the wool and wrap it decently around the end of a reed, then pour oil into the cavity of the ear, or juice from some herb, or water with one of these medicines in a syringe — which is in the ear —, then insert the wool-wrapped reed into the ear and press gently with your hand so that the oil is expelled into the cavity of the ear and the patient feels the oil inside.
And let what is placed in the ear be heated by fire just a little. And ensure that the liquid you are about to drip into the ear is not too cold, for ear medications do not tolerate this.
Chapter VII
On the treatment of earwax in ears.
Sometimes some children are born with unperforated ear canals, and this also happens in some adults due to an infection or growth in the canal; and this blockage sometimes occurs at the opening of the ear canal which is not visible, and sometimes it is in the outer parts.
And that which occurs at the opening of the ear, where the view is obstructed, is in the most difficult situations to heal.
And in that moment when you notice the patient's pulse, you should place your finger on the patient's wrist and observe it. So if you see an apparent abscess, open it with a sharp knife like this one.
If the opening is small and one side is sharp while the other is not; and if the knife is two fingerbreadths long, it will cause less injury to the wrist.
Therefore, if the abscess is under the skin of the wrist or in the flesh, then take it with fine scissors and cut it open quickly until all the flesh is removed.
And if the abscess is in the palm of the wrist, then take a fine needle and heat it slightly with fire, and then insert it into the flesh of the wrist.
Therefore, if you detect an abscess filled with water that the patient finds painful due to heaviness, try to relieve the pressure on it gently; and be careful not to injure the nerves in the wrist.
Then place a cloth of linen on the wrist according to the size of the opening that you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days until you are sure of the healing of the wound, or take some herbs and pour them into water and sprinkle it on the wound after washing, and use it; and if you see the wrist already suppurating, then it is necessary to remove that herb and replace it with another wrapped in a cerate made with rose oil until the suppuration has stopped; and then care for it until it is healed.
If there is an outflow of blood, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the wound to restrict the flow of blood, as described in the treatise on cauterization.
Chapter 8.
On the treatment of athezil that affects the eyelids.
Athezil affecting the eyelids of the eyes sometimes appears moist, other times it is dry.
Therefore, you should have those [eyelids] with tweezers or scissors, and then cut them off with the blade of their roots, and then place [them] on the places as needed.
But if pain with blood flow occurs, then you should cauterize them with a subtle pointed cautery.
And the best way to cauterize is near the incisions and when they return too many times due to some cause of their roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that affects the eyelids of the eyes.
Often something affects the eyelids of the eyes due to some cause that resembles swelling in its intensity and hardness, and for this reason it is called swelling.
And it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the eyelids below and above.
Therefore, the operation on them is that you should consider whether the swelling is caused by something coming out of the eyelid and spreading everywhere; and the cause of this is slight.
Therefore, make an incision in it with a knife along the length, and then remove all of that with ease until it is empty, and then suspend that with a hook and cut it out.
And if the swelling is large, then you should adjust it with stitches; and treat that until it is healed.
And if it is small, then no harm will come to you because the moisture from it will restore that and heal it.
And if the swelling is leaning towards the inner parts of the eyelid, you should examine the inner surface, then empty the eyelid and suspend the swelling with a hook, or make another incision as needed, and press it all around. And if the eyelid is lengthened by the incision, this will not cause any harm.
And at the beginning, wash the wound with salt water; and treat the area with oil that has been infused until it is healed.
Chapter .10
On the care of eyelids above the wound.
Eyelids are the membranes that are formed in the tissues of the upper eyelid, and they mostly affect children, worsening their eyesight and causing major cataracts; and they cannot look at the light of the sun because tears gather in them.
And because of this you see these people squinting all the time, and they sleep with their eyes closed; and their eyelids are swollen, which is already covered by inflammation, and there is an appearance of incipient blindness in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel incipient blindness within them.
And in some way of operation, the patient places his head on your hands, and then you place a cloth on him and around his head you make a ring according to the quantity which contains arthritis from all parts, and then you place that over it and press with your fingers all around so that there is blindness in the middle of the ring, and then make an incision in the middle of that humidity with a spatula with a slit through the length, and the slit should not be larger than the slit made in phlebotomy.
"However, in the case of a pregnant woman, you should cut the cord completely until you reach the uterus, because during more advanced stages of pregnancy, the uterus can rupture through a tear, following the shape of white fat.
"Therefore, extract it with the cloth you have wrapped between your aforementioned parts outside and roll between your right and left hands until it is emptied.
"And be careful not to push into the tear, so that with the spatula you do not reach the bone and damage it.
"However, if the afterbirth does not appear at the beginning of the tear, but you find it in the tear with ease, push gently until it appears; and then extract it as we have said; and then soak cloths in water and vinegar and place them on the area and secure them with powders.
"And then apply salt to it and place it in the cavity of the tear so that any remaining moisture is absorbed.
"And then care for it until it is healed.
"However, if a hot abscess forms in that area, then treat it with cold compresses until it is healed.
Sure! Please provide me with the first line from "Capitolo .xi." so I can translate it for you.
Here's the translation of the first line of "Capitolo .xi.":
When pustules appear on the eyelids of the eyes, beneath the natural hairs and they become old, then these cause damage to the eye and lead to various ailments such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids, and even blindness, which is known as "tactinir del huel". The cure for this can be done in four ways: either by cauterization with fire; or with sharp medicine as mentioned earlier in the chapter on cautery; or by performing tactinir through incision and suture; or with reeds as I will describe.
Therefore, you should place the head of the patient in your lap; then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand. If it is turned, that's good; if not, insert a needle into that part from which the pustule came out beneath the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with thread above, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs come out — near the hairs, and pull the thread to the parts above with the eyelid, and turn it with a ray.
Then open the pustule inside the eyelid beneath the hairs with a small incisional spatula into the lacrimal major and then into the lacrimal minor; then extract the thread and place beneath the eyelid small pieces of cotton or cloth, then apply over the eyelid a bandage, and let it be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sure, here is the line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And now, open with the spatula over the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the larger tear duct towards the smaller one. And if your split is near the natural hairs, as in the case of a king's size.
And then place the scalpel in one of the two angles of the anus, and then excise that entire area, and then join together the two lips with silk or fine wool thread, and cleanse the blood, and make adhere what exceeds of the threads on both eyebrows with some glue, if you wish to do so; otherwise, do not cure.
And then remove the stitches after three or four days, and then cure it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without stitches and cure it with something that dries and constricts, for the eyelid is raised due to the closure of the wound and its adhesion; but stitching is better and thus the ancients have said so about healing.
But nevertheless, be concerned about the patient, and it is a good operation, and there should not be any fear.
And there is another way to heal, and it is that you mark on the eyelid the shape of a myrtle leaf, and then raise the eyelid with three separate but connected stitches in this form:
If it is not possible to hold the eyelids open, and if this does not work, then take a needle with thread and insert it into the middle of the eyebrow, and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and the second thread near the smaller tear duct, and adjust the threads equally between these mentioned points, and then with those elevate your hand in a balanced manner, elevating the entire eyelid in this way as we have described.
Then adjust the two lips of the wound with stitches and heal it inside so that it is healed.
But if an abscess occurs, you must make an incision or a puncture, and heal that abscess with a plaster and similar materials, and with ointment.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid that its hair is turned around, so it is necessary for you to use on it what we have said about incision; but stitches on each one are more artificial.
To treat with canes in this manner: you must turn the eyelid and cut the figure that is inside, as I have described; and then by art make two canes or two thin rods whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width is less than the width of a spoon. And you have already cut into the ends of each divided section where you have the threads.
Then add with delicacy on that which overflows from the eyelid of the eye, and tighten the strings of each section with strong tension, and leave it for some days, because the thread through the tightening will die and fall off by itself.
But if it is delayed, then break it with tweezers, and then cure the wound until it heals.
Therefore when it is healed, the eyelid is lifted and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the way to make two strings according to this method: and let there be an amount equal in length and width, no more or less.
Chapter XII
About lifting pricking hairs from the eye with a needle when the hair is hard.
When the hairs are unnatural, hard and rough and prick the eyes, then the operation for this is that you take a fine needle and place it in a thin thread of silk or linen, and then adjust the ends of it and tie each one very finely. And let the length of the threads be about one palm in quantity.
And then you compose another thin thread under him quickly, and trim the ends of that if you wish.
And then place the patient's head on your shoulder, and let it be near the sunlight so that your work may be visible, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
And then insert the needle into the edge of the eyelid that needs repair, and make it penetrate quickly through the skin until you draw it out over the natural fold of the eyelid.
And then pull the skin taut and insert that into the needles, and let there be one or two or three stitches, but no more.
And then pull your hand along with it so that the skin is stretched tightly and sewn along the natural fold of the eyelid.
However, if the stitch is tight and the skin is not stretched, you should pull the thread to the sides with your hand along with that one until it stretches along the entire length of the wound.
And examine it with the eye of a professional, because when you have stretched and tied the thread and closed each stitch tightly, leave the knots for two or three days until the skin adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is too short, then adjust a long hair from the natural ones, and it is lifted with that, or let it be until it has lengthened to some extent, and then you lift it.
Chapter XIII
Of the care for excising what appears on the upper eyelid.
When it appears in the eye and is a contraction of the eyelid when it contracts upwards or to the right or left side, due to poor healing from a wound, incision, or cautery, and it is called leporine, this excision is either natural or accidental, and it occurs due to poor healing from wounds, incisions, or cauteries, or similar to their misfortune.
The manner of the operation is to split that scar and separate its lips, and place between them a piece of linen cloth, and bind them together until they are healed.
And it is not necessary to use any treatment for the causes that dry out or constrain, because if you do this, the excision returns worse than ever before.
Use in this case causes that soften, such as fenugreek, and boil it with hot water and flax seeds or linen oil, and soak the piece of cloth in it, and treat with it.
The text appears to be a medieval medical treatise, possibly written in Occitan or another similar language of that time period. Let's translate the provided sentence line by line:
And this operation which we have mentioned is not anything other than the rectification of a fracture that does not restore the form of the place as it was before.
Chapter XIV.
Of the care for a fracture which is made in the lower eyelid.
This fracture which is made in the lower eyelid, which is truly called a fracture; and it may be either natural or accidental.
However, an accidental one is made by a blow, or by a cut, or by cautery, or by other similar means.
And the way of operating it is that you take a needle with which there is threaded double thread, and you insert that into the flesh, and make it pass from the tear duct on the left side to the tear duct on the right side, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then extend the skin on both sides with the needle and sew it with the needle, and incise widely with a spatula. And thus if the shape of the eyelid returns as it should be, that is good; and if not, take the reed and place it in the split figure, and with that turn the eyelid, and make two slits on the side of the lower eyelid.
Based on the provided lines and the pattern of language used, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
"And this figure is Greek letters: the lance.
And then cut away that flesh to the extent that it is the length of his sharp edge under him, which should be the eyelid.
And then adjust the separated parts and suture them with wool thread; and then treat those [parts] with the water we mentioned of the emollient medicines and of the poultices until it is healed.
And if there is a need to raise [the skin] by incision or suture or cautery, then you should make an incision with a flat knife on the hairs of the eyelid as previously described. And then separate [the skin] with the poultice between the two lips as we have said.
In the summary of the treatment for raising [the skin] whether it is above or below, let the operation proceed in it, according to the preparation of the form of raising [the skin], and that is in the form of various spots.
And the skillful artisans always prepare an engine in every way that is possible for him until he returns the figure to its natural form, or as close to it as possible, and that patient according to his need of the operation and of the instruments in the best arrangements.
This line appears to be indicating a section or chapter title in the medieval medical treatise. Translating it directly into English, we get:
From the adhesion of the eyelid with the conjunctiva or the cornea.
When this consolidation occurs in many men so that the eyelid is stuck to the white of the eye and its movement and natural functions are hindered, it is necessary for you to insert the tip of a ray below the eyelid and lift it up with it, or extend it with an ointment.
Then you should cut the adhesion with a sharp, thin blade that is not too pointed to avoid discomforting the patient during the operation. And make sure the blade does not scratch the eye with its sharpness.
And let your cut be such that it easily removes the adhesion until the eyelid is returned to its natural shape and all of the adhesion is healed.
Then you should put salt water in the eye with which to wash it; or you can instill some dissolved hyacinth in water into it.
Then separate the eyelid from the eye with oil of lily, and place over the eye a compress soaked in white of egg, and on the third day use consolidative poultices until it is healed.
"Chapter XVI.
"Of the onset of a nail and the prominence of flesh in the tear ducts.
"Know that there are two types of nails: one is nervosa, resembling fine and subtle bone; the other is non-nervosa, similar to congealed white humidity. When it touches flesh, it is necessary to take it off with pincers, and after cutting it off, do not put pincers into it.
"And both species begin only from the larger tear duct, which gradually covers the eye and prevents it from seeing and moving.
"However, the way to proceed in removing it is for the patient to place his head against your chest, then open his eyes, and with your hand lift the eyelid. Then collect the nail with small, double-pronged pincers and remove it from the parts. "And then take a needle and insert into it a horsehair or cow hair or sheep hair, or something similar, or strong thread. Or double the end of the needle little by little and place it in the middle of the nail, and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with thread; and remove it from the parts, and scrape off the attachment of the nail which is the pupil with the hair. "And thus you should follow that [procedure] by entering the pelvis from behind.
"And then you should insert the remaining [instrument] into the root of the tear duct with a thin spatula or small scissors, and clear the tissue of the natural tear duct so that continuous tearing does not occur from the incision.
"And sometimes the nail with the long end extended or with a file, as we have said, and then it should be cleaned with a thin spatula of this form:
"And be careful that with the spatula you do not touch the corneal layer and cause a tear, and that the pupil is not perforated.
"Then insert into the eye a little bit of finely ground salt or a similar preparation made from ashes, and leave it there overnight; and then clean it with water until it is healed.
"And if the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert the needle into it, or if it is fixed to the bone, then many times this type of nail is treated with medications and healed as I have mentioned in the division.
"And if you wish to incise it, then you should open the eye of the patient and take a thin, sharp spatula with this form: "I am subtlety. "And if you see that it is rarified and hidden within that vessel, then distill from your hour in the vessel of glass made from sand or with a glass tube, and collect the liquid into another container until the next day.
"And then repeat the operation on it until all of its liquid has been removed, except if there is a counter-abscess in the vessel, because then you leave it, and treat the abscess at first until it heals.
"And then repeat your operation on it with reason until it is healed.
"The prominence of the tear-bearing flesh, if it is noticed in the vessel for great harm, should be suspended with a hook; and incise that part of it, but do not complete the incision so that tears do not flow.
"And then distill into the tear-bearing glass tube or sand vessel until it is healed.
Chapter XVII.
"About the incision of algae-removal and about the water that is born from firm flesh in the vessel.
"Sometimes in the vessels of some people, flesh-like growths are born, and they spread until they cover the pupil, or they approach and press strongly on the eyelids, compressing them to the outer parts, and it resembles the roughness of a balustrade.
Sure, I'll provide a line-by-line translation of the given text:

Here's the translation of your sentence:
This is a challenging translation as the text seems to be written in a hybrid language, possibly an early form of Romance language with Latin influences. I'll attempt to translate it line by line:
Here's my translation of the sentence:
"Chapter 18.
"About collecting pus in the wound.
"Pus consists of veins that are closed over the wound and prevent the bandage from working properly, causing the wound to linger for days.
"Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning to consider if the wound in which there is pus is strong and there is no other ailment besides pus, then you should collect that pus.
"And you must instruct the patient to rest their head on your lap, and then suspend those veins with an ounce or two, according to your judgment; and let that ounce be of fine double-folded material, in this manner:
"or have two onces gradually in one piece like this:
"And then those veins should be collected with thin forces, carefully, and clean the blood little by little until you see that the veins are removed from the wound and they are turned.
"And be careful not to injure the wound with the edges of the spatula; and if your operation is at noon before the sun, and you are very steady in your operation so that you do not cut anything except those veins.
And when you have completed [the task], then you distill into the head a clear oil or vinegar so that with its sharpness it may dissolve what is removed from the liver.
But if it is not possible to collect everything at that time, then you should bandage the entire area with a substance that alleviates pain from him, and leave him for several days until his pain subsides and he is assured of avoiding infection.
Then you should repeat the process on him in the same manner until he is cured.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter Nineteen
On the Reduction of Dislocated Nasal Bones
When you treat a nasal dislocation with a cautery or sharp medicine as described previously and it does not heal, then do not cut into it, but rather make incisions over the abscess until it matures, and extract all the moisture within it and the pus until the bone is exposed.
And once the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackening, then you should scrape it with an instrument of this form:
And it is called a sharp-headed instrument, made of iron, with a rounded head like an awl, which should be punctured by a file or sharpened with fine points (as shown in the following diagram).
And place [something] on the rotten part of the bone, and then rotate it between your teeth, and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped off.
And this should be done several times, and then restore the area with desiccating and styptic substances.
Therefore, if the area is healed and good flesh has grown there, and the body is free of pus for forty days, and it does not recur or become inflamed or experience any setbacks, then you know that it is healed.
And if not, then it is not wise to do anything but reduce the slit to the shape of the nose, and in this way: you should expose the bone with a file or sharp medicine, and when the bone is exposed, then take a file of this form:
Let the end of the file be triangular, and let its shaft be first tapered to the point like this: as you see it done here.
Then place it on the bone, and let it be near the lacrimal; and extend your hand a little into the cheek, and then rotate your hand with the file until it penetrates all the way through the bone, and the patient will feel relief as they see blood coming out from their own hand.
Therefore, at that point, restore the area with astringent medicines, drying it as you have been taught.
Therefore, when the flesh and the area have hardened, at that point the matter that was flowing to the outside parts returns to the nose, so it is easier on the patient.
Chapter XX
On the reduction of a nasal polyp.
When the nose protrudes in its entirety and does not cause injury or diminishment in vision, then you should allow the patient to relax, and follow them closely, and place cupping glasses on the neck without scarification for good suction; and then apply a liniment on the nose that is made from acacia, aloe, lentil, and sarcocolla, and then strengthen the plaster on the nose with many powders.
And the manner of the powders is to take many strips of fine linen cloth, and each strip should be folded into four layers; make many [of these].
And then place them one on top of the other according to the amount that the nose needs. And then strengthen them with a hard cloth tied tightly; and reapply the cupping glasses with suction without scarification; and then remove the cupping glasses and leave the nose bandaged day and night.
If during this time the ligament has become softened, then it should be very tight.
And then remove the ligament both day and night as we have said.
And if you see that the wound has already healed, that is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster with the powders and the constriction and the cupping until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Of the incision of the eminence of the tunica uvea.
When there is a disruption in the tunica uvea, and it protrudes out of the eyelids like a grain of sand, and its shape resembles that of a human face, and you wish to incise this, then the operation on it will be as we have recommended: you insert the needle into the root of the uvea from below towards above, and then insert another needle from the lacrimal part, which should be double-threaded, and make that one penetrate and leave the first needle according to its position; then incise the place of the double thread and lift with it the part of the uvea around the needle, and strengthen this very much.
And then remove the needle and place wool soaked in egg white over the wound, allowing it to heal naturally with the help of nature.
And then treat the wound with comforting water until the injury is healed.
And sometimes add a circular bandage around the entire wound to create a slight elevation. Then, carefully pierce the bandage with a thin spatula so that it reaches just below the skin, allowing any moisture to drain away, and then immediately close and cover the wound again.
And then strengthen until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of wounds.
This condition, which is called ulcer, is nothing more than an open wound that resembles descending water and it is not that.
But the way to treat it is to make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take their head in your hands on both sides and hold it until you see the wound begin to dry out from below, and prevent any moisture from descending, and let the patient observe the causes as they see them.
And if it does not descend downwards, know that it is water (i.e., the cause of the ulcer is due to fluid retention).
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
When it is forgotten, then you administer into the nostril hot water in which you have mixed honey or in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then he should be treated with other remedies until he is healed.
Chapter .22
About the treatment of water dripping from the nose.
We have already discussed the types of water in the division and which ones are suitable for making holes by declaring as much as is necessary according to health.
Then you should sit the patient between your hands on a stool and tie their nose tightly shut with a bandage.
And then place your left hand near the upper eyelid of the nose from which water is dripping; or with your right hand if it is the right nostril.
And then with your right hand take aloes if it is the left nostril; or with your left hand if it is the right nostril.
Then place the tip of aloes at the edge of the nostril near the corner of the eye, close to the smallest tear duct, and then peel off the aloes with skill and turn your hand with it.
And then penetrate into the mouth of the wound and feel that pus has already arrived due to the view.
And it should be that the measure of the path of pus to the foreskin is equal to the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the black, and it is the crown of the wound; for you will see with this pupil the vision of the wound through the clarity of the corneal tunica.
Then place the pus into the location where there is water, and then draw it down once, then again another time; and if the water descends quickly, then see the patient on which side his vision fails quickly, and the pus in its wound.
And then wait a little while; and if the water has descended, then pause that other time before the pus is ejected.
And then when it is dry and does not descend, you can easily extract the pus, and roll it a little at a time with your hand, and then dissolve in the water a small amount of clear salt from rock, and with that wash the inside of the wound; and then cover the outside of the wound with cotton or wool or linen soaked in rose oil and egg white, and bind the wound with water.
"But we and those of our time apply this remedy with an egg white mixture.
"And if your patient does not obey you in the application of the egg because of its harshness—for it is harsh for some people—then you should take the unguent which is called Albarid, and this is its formula:
"And so you should penetrate that joint with it, and do not leave your hand in the wound, lest you provide a path for the disease to spread.
"Then apply the remedy as we have said.
"And you must ensure that your work is completed; prepare a suitable bed for the patient to sleep on their back in a dark room, and they should be forbidden from all movements.
"And place upon him something to make his nature smooth, and do not move his head to the right or left at all.
"And let the patient rest according to their disposition for up to three days.
"Then release him in that dark chamber and try his sight, show him some objects, and then let him rest again for seven days.
"And it is not necessary to do this at the time of the bleeding or immediately after the infusion. "It is necessary that you remove it because the water can move lightly but with great and vigorous force.
"But if an abscess forms, then it is necessary to open the wound before seven days, and rectify it with water that can cause the abscess to dissolve.
"Then you should cover his face and place an oral mask over it to regulate his breathing for a few days, keeping him in the darkest place possible.
"And then he should be gradually removed from that darkness and returned to normal conditions.
"And know that in a cataract, the disciple is not exempt from vision sometimes, and then you should be bold in performing the operation.
"And it has come to our attention from some of those who are in the profession, and one said that he made fire in the great vein perforated with which the water was sucked out.
"But however, I have not seen anyone in our land who has perfected this, nor is it mentioned in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is a new method.
"And these are the forms of the species of veins, for which one should be aware of them if one is ignorant of them:
And they should be made of iron or steel properly, and their tips should have this subtlety: they are triangular in shape with an acute point.
### Chapter XXIV
From the treatment of flesh that has been affected in the nose.
When various growths appear in the nose, one of which is caused by a stinging insect bite or a polyp, this condition is called polypus because it resembles that type of growth. And if the flesh is cancerous, livid, and dark in color, it is called "carn leon" because of its darkness.
Therefore, in cases where these "carn leon" are not fraudulent or cancerous, it is necessary for the patient to sit between your hands and be exposed to the sun, with the nostrils of their nose open and you picking at those growths with a needle. Then extract that [growth] to the outer parts, and then cut what you have grasped from those [parts] with a sharp, thin spatula from one part until you know that all the flesh has been removed; if any of it remains, causing possible absorption, then you should scrape that away with one of the thin instruments until nothing remains. But if it bleeds or causes an abscess, then you should apply what is necessary; or if it is a malignant abscess, then you should incise and cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all the cavities are emptied.
And now pour into the nose near the opening vinegar and water or wine. But if the nose is open and moisture flows into the palate from it, then you know that he has already been cured.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside there is flesh rotting in the upper bones of the nose where the abscess has not reached.
Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a linen cloth of some thickness into him, and thread in the threads needles, and place between each needle the quantity of the said hand or month, and have the patient lean forward and insert one end of the cloth into the nose with a reed or with another instrument that is available to you.
And after doing this, let it soak in its own scent until it reaches the channels of the nose, and it is exited on its gullet, for many times children at schools do similar things, and it is an easy thing to do for someone who wants to do it.
And then place the two ends of the cloth, one end coming out of the nose and the other remaining inside the nose, and then administer a meat bandage with the needles that are in the cloth, and do this until you know that the flesh is already attached to the needles of the cloth.
And then remove the bile, and place near the nostril a cupping glass for bloodletting, and do this for three days or more until the ointment has dissolved everything that is rotten in the flesh.
And then at the end of this treatment, place a lead pipe in the nostril for several days until it is healed.
But if you prefer to use drying remedies, use them.
And this is the form of the instrument for making cap-purges with which oils and medicines are administered in the nose.
And make this of silver or brass, which should be similar to a small open lamp or a small cup, with an opening similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed cupping glass like a reed, and let the tube of the cap-purge instrument be flat and open; at the end of it there should be a handle by which you may hold it when you pour into it oil or water or whatever juices and suckable substances you desire.  (This passage describes how to make and use a closed cupping glass for administering oils, water, or other liquids through the nose.)
Capítulo .xxv. (Capítulo means "Chapter" in English.)
The hairs are born in the nostrils of the nose.
Many times it is said that hair grows in the nostrils of the nose, and it is magnified and remembered on certain days when something else is being considered.
And for that reason, you should write that at the beginning of its appearance and record all of it. Then place on the spot either a cautery or a burning medicine which was in its place.
But if the recording is delayed until it is magnified, then consider whether it has hardened, is hard, of dark color and with little feeling, then do not touch it with iron because it is a malignant abscess; for many times that which you record this abscess will bring great harm to the one on whom it was.
And if the abscess is of soft consistency and not dark in color, and it is possible to record it in all cases, then evacuate the patient and record it without fear, and treat the spot with something that dries and constricts until it is healed.
Chapter .xxvi.
On the stitching of the nose and lips and ears when their continuity is broken by wounds or similar things.
You should know that when there is a break in continuity of one of these cartilages, you will rarely perform this operation except on some men.
Therefore, when someone has one of these causes, consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood, and then join the two lips of the wound with stitches, and then cure him until he is healed.
And if the lips of the break in continuity are already separated and each is healed, then you should scrape off each divided part until blood appears. And then join the two lips with stitches and strengthen them, and sprinkle powdered dragon's blood and myrrh over them, and place on the powder a thin layer of emplastrum diaphonicus, or some other consolidative emplaster, and let it lie for two or three days, and then remove it and replace the emplaster, and let it lie until the sutures dissolve by themselves, and then cure with ointment until he is healed.
But the manner of suturing is that you bring together the break in continuity with needles as we have explained in the suturing of the abdomen, or join the break in continuity with thread as has been shown to you.
Chapter 27.
About the removal of that cause which appears in both lips on the inside.
Many physicians should see many men in the inner parts of their lips with hard swellings similar to pig fat, and some are smaller and some are larger.
Therefore, you should turn the lips and split each of these hard parts on all sides, then fill the place with finely sifted lard until the blood is drained, and then wash it with strong vinegar and treat the place with water that has been made astringent, until it is healed.
Chapter 28.
About the incision of flesh attached to the gums.
Many physicians should know about the flesh attached to the gum, which the ancients called albulus. Therefore, you should suspend it with a hook or with forceps, and you should cut that as deeply as possible, and let the pus or blood run out.
And then place over the area finely sifted lard or other astringent or drying powders.
And if that flesh returns, then cut it secondarily, and cauterize it, because after cautery it will not return.
Chapter 29
Concerning dental pain with a toothache.
When in the surface of the separated teeth, both front and back, and between the gums, sharp and rough scabs form, and sometimes they are blackened and become yellow or green until the gum appears to be corrupt, and the teeth loosen.
Therefore, you should have the patient sit between your hands and rest his head on your chest. Scrape the teeth where those scabs appear, causing them to crumble like sand until no cause remains, and this will remove the blackness, the yellowness, and the other discolorations until they are cleansed.
If this is not enough to relieve the initial cause of the pain, then you should repeat the treatment on those teeth for another day and a second and a third day until it finally reaches the desired outcome.
And know that teeth require many scrapers of various shapes and forms depending on what is prepared for your operation. And because the scraper for a separated tooth is different from the one used between teeth according to other shapes, and these shapes of scrapers must be prepared by you as you will see shortly:
It looks like you've provided only the chapter number without any text. To proceed with the translation, please provide a sentence or paragraph from Chapter 30 (Capitol .xxx) of the medieval medical treatise.
Of tooth extraction.
You should treat the tooth in its entirety and delay its extraction as long as possible, because there is no reason to hasten its removal once it has been extracted. This is because it is a noble substance that deserves respect during its removal.
However, when the patient is determined to have that tooth extracted, you must be certain which tooth is causing the pain, because often the pain deceives the patient and he believes it is coming from a healthy tooth. If you extract that tooth, the pain will not cease until the diseased and painful tooth has been removed, as we have seen happen due to the action of nerves.
Therefore, in order to be certain which tooth is causing the pain and you know it well, you should then scarify around the tooth with a spatula containing some virtuous substance, until it has dissolved the entire gum area surrounding the tooth. Then, make a small incision with your words or with fine forceps little by little, until you succeed in doing so.
This sentence seems to describe a procedure involving the use of tongs or forceps on the patient's head and teeth. Here's a line-by-line translation:
And therefore, if it is not forgotten, then take one of those instruments and place it under the patient in such a way that it is easy and efficient to move them as was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is shaky or decayed, then it is necessary that you fill that cavity with cloth and tighten it with the tip of a fine thread so that it does not break during your constriction with tweezers.
And it is necessary that you work precisely with scarification around the entire gum area and be careful not to break it or leave a piece of it, and return to the patient for the pain to be less than before.
And be careful not to do what some ignorant barbers do in their imprudence and audacity when extracting teeth, without administering what we have recommended; for many times they cause great evils to afflict men, which are more difficult than breaking the tooth, and all or some of its roots, or that you extract it with some bones from the jaw, as we have testified many times.
And immediately after removing the tooth, rinse the mouth with warm water or vinegar mixed with salt.
And if blood flow occurs in this manner, just like numerous times it should occur, then cut some quantity of silk and sprinkle it over the wound. If that silk does not help, cauterize.
The shape of the forceps and fine tweezers with which the tooth is initially grasped should be long at the end and short in the handle and thick, so that they are not bent when you have to work with them.
And so they should be thick in the handle until, when you tighten with them, they are not bent, and they should be short at the end.
And they should be made of Indian steel, straight at the end, and on those ends there should be teeth, some of which fit into others and tighten by strong constriction, and sometimes those ends are in the shape of a stork's beak, which is wide, and they are of very strong constriction.
Chapter 31.
Of the removal of teeth and the extraction of bones from clenched jaws.
When you need to remove a tooth that is clenched, there is some cause for this. Then you should place on the spot cotton with border for one day or two until the spot becomes soft; and then insert algesti or tweezers, the ends of which are similar to the beak of a bird called a stork or heron, in the shape of forceps:
"Their extremities should be made smooth inside, like with a file or pumice stone.
"And if you do not obey with these tweezers or tongs, then you must cut into the flesh and peel back all the skin and insert the instrument called 'atali,' which is a small lever whose shape is like this:
"And let it have a short, thick handle, and not be inserted too deeply so that it does not get stuck.
"Therefore, if the flesh is pierced in this way, it is good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments, whose shapes are as follows: The shape of the first instrument is a triangular tip with some thickness:
"The shape of the second instrument should be a more refined triangular tip.
"And you have been helped with this instrument, which has two handles. Its shape is approximately as follows: "and with other instruments that will be used for tooth extraction; because initially this instrument is made like a large thorn, and this is its shape:
"with a twisted or short triangular tip that has some thickness, and should not be inserted too deeply to avoid getting stuck.
And you should know that dental tools are similar and resemble other tools.
But skillful and discerning artisans in their craft find for themselves according to what the operation and various illnesses indicate; because there are illnesses for which the ancients did not specify or use a particular tool, due to the diverse forms of various species.
But if the bone of the jaw or other bones of the mouth is broken or fractured, then it should be treated in its place with whatever appropriate tools and forceps we have mentioned for the extraction of tooth roots. Assist yourself with this gesture, whose form is as follows:
And if there is any slight swelling, reduce it gradually and keep the mouth closed so that it does not swell or become inflamed until the bone has completely healed; then restore the area with appropriate medicines.
But if there is a small fracture in the bone, then remove that fractured part and its blackness, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter 32.
On the care of prominent teeth over others.
When the teeth are prominent not according to their natural form, which is unpleasant and especially when it occurs in women, particularly elderly ones; therefore, you should consider: if the tooth is near another tooth and it is not possible to remove or straighten it, then reduce that tooth; but if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument whose shape is as follows; it resembles a pig's snout, and is made of very sharp Indian iron.
And let your incision be with that which you have cut for many days due to the hardness of the tooth, and ensure that no other tooth is affected.
And if it is an exposed tooth to be filed down, then file it with an Indian iron file of this shape:
And let everything be of Indian iron, both the file and the points; and let them be very fine points like those used to make needles, with which you should gently file the tooth little by little over many days, so that no other tooth is affected or falls out. And then clean it at the end, and scrape it with sharp razors.
And if it is a tooth from which a piece has broken off and the tongue touches it, then you must file down that part until its roughness is removed and smoothed out, and filled in, so that the tongue does not get cut and speech is not impaired.
Chapter XXXIII.
On restoring broken teeth with a gold or silver filling.
When an accident occurs to the front teeth due to a blow or fall, causing them to be loosened or knocked out, and the patient cannot eat anything hard, and you have treated it with astringent medicines, but your treatment has not been effective, then in order for them not to fall out, put those that are strong with a gold filling, not silver. Because silver turns black after a few days and soon becomes loose, but gold never changes.
Here's the line-by-line translation of the given text: It appears that there was an issue with displaying the provided text in my response. Please provide the full sentence again so I can assist you better.
And with your thumb, which you have strengthened with the file, you should rub the gums of the teeth so that they do not decay.
And then cut the excess filings with the forceps or scissors, and add them to each place with care, and turn them over and hide them between the healthy tooth and the decayed tooth, so that they do not cause damage to the tongue. And then leave it as tight as a rope.
But if it is loose or broken, strengthen that one or those ones with another file in such a manner at all times.
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the extraction of two healthy teeth and two decayed teeth, as you see these tied together.
And when it is done that a tooth or two returns to its place, and they are cut back as we have advised, and they remain so.
And do not do this except with skilled and wise artisans.
And sometimes it is appropriate to use some cause of the bones of a cow, and they are made from them in the shape of a tooth, and they are placed in the place where the tooth fails, and they are strengthened as we have said, and they remain and serve with that for a long time.
Capítulo (Chapter) XXXIV
Prohibition of speech due to pain in the tongue.
This ligament that appears under the tongue at times is either natural with which one is born or it is accidental and occurs due to a wound that has already healed.
The operation is to open the mouth of the patient, with their head tilted back; raise their tongue, and then cut the nervous ligament until the tongue is released from its stiffness.
But if there is any hardness or knotting, and this is due to the consolidation of a wound, then apply oil and cut until you have cut through the ligament and dissolved the knotting.
And be careful not to make a split in the flesh, and that you cut only the ligament and avoid blood flow.
And then wash the traces of the incision with water or vinegar or cold water; and then place a bandage under the tongue. This is the measure that must keep the patient's tongue away from touching in any night so that it does not become stiff again.
Sure, let's translate this sentence line by line: And then that healer enters with the other causes until he is cured.
Chapter .xxxv.
Chapter XXXV: On the Extraction of a Salivary Cyst from the Tongue
Sometimes, an abscess resembling a small nipple appears beneath the tongue, preventing it from performing its natural function; and often this is greatly enlarged until it fills the mouth.
And the operation on it is that you open the mouth of the patient, seated before the sun and observe the abscess.
And if you see it of a dark or black color, hard, in which the patient feels no pain, then do not touch that one because it is cancerous.
And if it inclines towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then you place a knife in it and carefully cut into it with a thin spatula, and cut it from all sides; and if blood comes out during your operation, then you place upon it three times sewn sage, because it is vitriol, until the bleeding stops.
And then return to your work until you have removed it entirely, after washing it with vinegar and salt; and heal that with the other cure until he is cured.
Capítulo XXXVI
Acerca de la extracción de un absceso en ambas orejas, y de aquel que se forma en el cuello y de los otros abscesos.
Cuando se desarrolla un absceso en el cuello que parece algodón, y estos son llamados glándulas submandibulares que aparecen fuera del cuerpo, si las tratas con el agua mencionada en la división y no sanan, entonces considera si el absceso es duro, de color oscuro y con poca sensibilidad. En ese caso, no lo toques con hierro.
Y si es de color rojo y la raíz es grande, entonces no lo toques con hierro debido al flujo de sangre; antes déjalo que madure por sí mismo, y luego o bien drenarás el absceso o se romperá por sí solo.
Y si es de color blanco, redondo y con una raíz delgada, entonces ese es el tipo de absceso que debe ser inciso.
Y la operación en él debe considerarse antes de proceder con la operación. Debes observar si el absceso ha reposado con un reposo completo o si se ha reducido con alguna disminución; entonces haz que el paciente esté de pie ante el sol, y su cabeza esté inclinada hacia el suelo, abre la boca del paciente, y los asistentes, tomando entre sus manos la lengua del paciente, déjenlo con un instrumento muy noble cuya forma es la siguiente:
And let it be made of silver or iron, and let it be sharp like a knife.
Therefore, when you press down with that instrument and the abscess appears, and you cut over it, then take a pair of tongs and place that around the opening, and pull it out as much as possible. Another thing to keep in mind is that when pulling something out, you may cause damage to the tunic. Therefore, cut it with an instrument shaped like this:
Another thing to keep in mind is that when pulling something out, you may cause damage to the tunic. Therefore, cut it with an instrument shaped like this: and it resembles forceps, but the ends of them are curved in such a way that the opening of each is at the end of the other, very sharp, which should be made of iron.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then cut it with a spatula shaped like this: and let it be sharp on one side and blunt on the other side.
And since you have cut one opening, cut the other in the same manner, and then the patient will heal from cold water.
But if there is bleeding, let the patient heal with water from a decoction of pomegranate peels or myrtle leaves, similar to other hemostatic causes, until the blood flow stops, and then treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes it appears on the gullet or ulcers, and other times on both ears, and cut those according to what I have said about cutting two apples equally.
And I have healed a woman with an abscess that was located on her throat, which abscess had a dark color and little feeling, which had already closed off her throat, and the woman breathed with difficulty, and I had already forbidden her from eating and drinking water, and she would have reached death if it had lasted one or two more days.
And the abscess had grown so much that there were two hollows formed, and it burst through two openings.
Therefore, I carefully made an incision and inserted one of them into one of the openings, and drew it out, from which a large amount was expelled. And then I cut that part where I understood the other opening to be, and then I forced open her mouth, and pressed down her tongue, and then I inserted the reed into that abscess.
And then I drained a large amount from it, and nothing came out of it except for a little blood. Therefore, the woman's throat was completely healed, and she began to drink water immediately, and then she resumed eating food. However, I did not stop cutting from that abscess many times over a long period, and another abscess formed in its place, which I cut open until it was elongated.
"So I took the cautery and cauterized the patient's vein, then I added this; and then I walked around and did not know what God had done to me in that regard.
"Chapter 37.
"On the incision of a boil when it is ripe.
"When the boil descends to the boil and is ripe and long, it is called a perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part, large and round, then it is called a bubble.
"But when it is healed with the water that we have said in the division, and you do not complete your cure, and also if the boil has already burst and is subtle, then you should incise that which is added to it in a round shape; and if it is at that length, and it is bloody, of dark color or black, and it does not heal, then you must attempt the incision of it, because there is danger for the patient in this.
"And when you see that according to the manner that I have described for its whiteness and length, you should make the patient sit up and press their tongue with the instrument which processes its shape, and then place the scalpel in the new opening, and pull it down and incise it with one of two instruments which are mentioned in the incision of two mills.
And it is important that you do not inject more than what is necessary without addition, because if you inject too much, you will weaken their speech.
And for the injection, use the solution we recommended for injecting two almonds, and make sure it heals well.
But if the patient is frightened by the injection, it is necessary to use cunning in the cauterization without causing fear. The manner of cauterizing should only be with sharp water. Place the patient's head on your lap and then press their tongue with the instrument we mentioned, and then take some of the water we mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and make a living cause with it. Do not make it too thick or too thin, and with this fill the concavity of the instrument which has this form:
Let the end of the concavity where the medicine is placed be like the concavity of a teaspoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the tongue. The patient should lean back so that the saliva or mucus from his mouth runs out due to the intrinsic medicine, so that no cause descends into his throat and weakens him.
And then take your hand with the medicine and squeeze it over the uvula for about half an hour until you see it become darkened and soothed by the bite of the medicine.
And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of the ray, then submerge the cotton in the medicine, insert the ray with the cotton into a glass vessel until the cotton adheres to the vessel. Do this as many times as necessary until you achieve the desired cauterization of the uvula. Then leave it like that so that it dries and falls off after about three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the application of medicine, repeat it. Then cleanse the area around the uvula with cotton dipped in warm water, wash it with the water used for the medicine, then rinse with cold water, and treat it externally with an ointment, and internally with gargles until it heals.
And this type of treatment is safer than surgery and longer lasting.
Sometimes the uvula is cured with something more subtle than cautery and surgery, for it can be cured by sublimation in this manner: Take calamus, hyssop, oregano, rue, dried Arabic gum, chamomile, borage, and similar herbs. Mix all these ingredients, or some of them, into a solution; immerse them in strong wine vinegar and boil; ensure the container is well-sealed with wax, and there should be a small hole at the top of the container where an appropriately shaped silver or iron instrument is placed.  (This section might be describing a makeshift distillation apparatus for herbal remedies.)
And if the extremity (finger or other body part) has been inserted into the mouth of the patient until the vapor reaches the uvula and obscures it.
And then apply the moist cloth until it is dry, and be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of an abscess formation, because it would tighten the abscess too much, and you should only do this if you can clearly see the abscess on the skin.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed and attach an eggshell to its end, so that the patient's mouth is covered, because the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter .xxxviii
On the removal of splinters and water that sticks in the throat, and other causes.
Moist cloths stick to the throat or a splinter from a thorn or any other cause.
Therefore, you should remove the water that is visible from these, on which your sight falls, since you press the tongue with an instrument in front of it, so that what is in the throat becomes clear to you.
And that which is not apparent and is hidden in the throat, you should make the patient vomit before the food has digested in the stomach, because strongly linked to the throat is the cause of forked tongue, which is expelled through vomiting; or have the patient swallow a piece of bread or a radish of lettuce or a mouthful of dry bread; or take a piece of dried sea sponge on a leek, and tie it strongly with grease, and then have the patient swallow it, because when it reaches the place where thorns are located, they are extracted. And take an eel and bind it with grease, and place it inside the mouth, and through sucking it is extracted; or take a leek and place it in the mouth, and through sucking you draw it out.
But if they are not expelled with the causes we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument according to this form:
And let it be thicker than a little finger, and at the end of it there should be a cavity which you insert into their throat easily.
And let the patient have their head raised up, and be careful that the touch of their throat bone is such that it moves to one side or with which you peel off the bone or thorn, or what that physician does with his hand.
It seems the text is discussing a medical procedure or treatment for an "entrometa," which could be interpreted as an object lodged in the body or perhaps an internal issue like a hernia. Let's translate it step by step:
It seems like you've shared the chapter number rather than the actual text for translation. Please provide the full sentence or paragraph from the medieval medical treatise that you would like translated into English.
De la extracción de la sangre por medio de un sanguijuela adherida al cuello.
When the medicinal leech is applied with the water we mentioned in the division of treatments with medicines and not cuts, consider then on the neck of the patient to the left side, after you have compressed their tongue with the instrument that has been recommended to you.
Therefore, if you see blood in the leech, extract it gently with a small spoon or fine tweezers.
And if it is not possible to extract [the blood] with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's neck, and then place a heated iron in the concavity of the cannula, and do this as many times (until the leech is dead and detaches from the neck) and let the patient abstain from water for the entire day.
And immediately take a basin full of cold water and open the patient's mouth into it, and wash their mouth with it; and do not swallow any of that water and spit out the water after an hour or so, because the leech as soon as it feels the water, escapes.
Mays si no es foro-getada am aquo que havem recomtat, lahoras subfumigua le malaute am cimetz o am assafetida per le instrument le qual havem recomtat en la sufumiguacio de uvula.
Do this, so that it may fall.
And another way to perform this operation with the smoke is that you take a container filled with ignited charcoal, and cover the container with a lid that has a hole in its center; insert the end of the instrument into this hole, then place the container over the area to be fumigated. Have the patient put their mouth on the end of the cannula, and close their mouth so that the smoke is not exhaled until you know that the smoke has reached the leech, because the leech will fall immediately.
If it does not fall, then you must repeat the fumigation many times, and prevent the patient from drinking; they should eat only salted foods and avoid water, and with this treatment it is necessary that it be expelled.
And this is the form of the instrument with which a leech is removed from the throat when it is seen; and it resembles forceps in this way, except that it has some curvature. which is placed in the throat, and its tip resembles the beak of a stork, which is blunt, on which there are serrations made by a file, so that when you press against some part, it does not slip.
It seems that this text is written in an Old Occitan or Catalan dialect, often used in medieval medical treatises. Let's break down the sentence:
In which is the summary of the speech in the opening of abscesses and in their section.
The abscesses are many kinds, in many ways, according to the memory of them, each one in this book.
And they are different in their piercing and section, by two methods: one according to the kind of abscess in itself, and the other depending on the moisture content.
And the second method is according to the places in which they occur in the body, because an abscess occurring in the head is different from one occurring in the buttocks; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from one occurring in a joint; and each of them has its own judgment for operation.
Moreover, there are some abscesses that should not be pierced except close to the maturation of the pus in them or their completion.
There are other abscesses that should be pierced when they are green and not mature according to their development, such as those near the joints, because when an abscess is near a joint, its being prolonged until it can be emptied of what is around it, and easily the ligaments or nerves of that joint become corrupted, causing contraction of that limb; or it is an abscess near the main limb, and if you delay piercing it until it has matured in the main limb; or it is near the buttocks, then pierce it while not mature; but do not pierce it when green, immaturely digested, except that which is near the buttocks, so that its pus does not increase and is lengthened into the inner parts of the buttocks, and a fistula is formed, or what is done on its border so that it does not heal. "But I want you to know the time of the lancing of the abscess, and that is when it has matured.
"And know that it is mature when there is the cessation of pain and fever, as well as the reduction of redness and pulse, and the sharpness of the abscess head, and other signs.
"And why it is important to know that the incision should be made in the place lower than the abscess and from which pus is coming out for the healing of the prominence.
"And the incision should always be made along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and in the places of the arms, of the cords of the nerves, of the armpits; and, finally, in all places equal in which there is no reflection; because in those that are reflected, use incision according to that member.
"But when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better to leave the incision of it until its digestion is confirmed according to the time we have mentioned; because if you make the incision before that, the body of the pus and much filth will be prolonged, and the lips of it will be hardened and the depth of it increased.
But some abscesses need to be pierced according to the thickness of the flesh or the body part, depending on what that particular member requires.
And it is necessary to administer a small puncture for small abscesses and a large, wide puncture or multiple incisions for larger abscesses, depending on the size of the abscess.
And there are other abscesses in which it is necessary to curve the blade and make an incision when done this way, like bread, and when it is made it should be at a time that it stings, as happens with cases of double chin and buboes.
And of those [abscesses] are those that are incised with a triangular section; and among them is the one that is incised like a myrtle leaf, such as the abscesses of the ankles.
And among them are those in which a round or crescent-shaped incision is made, and similar to these.
But for those [abscesses] that do not have a head, such as superficial lion abscesses, it is necessary to pierce them with a shallow or flat puncture only.
And when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, you should pierce it but be careful not to draw out all the matter at once; having extracted some of it, close the abscess again until the next day, then extract a larger amount, and repeat this process several times according to the degree [of severity] until it is completely drained.
And especially if the patient is a young child, or a pregnant woman, or an elderly person in decline, because the vital spirit often departs with the discharge of blood, and the patient dies quickly, and you open them (the veins).
But be very careful with this chapter, and especially when you make a perforation in which you open these abscesses, it is necessary to clean the wounds and consider whether the wound of the abscess is small or a flat section, then administer the ointments of lily or cotton; but if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then it is necessary that you place a cloth in each opening until they come together.
And if in the abscess a part of the intestine is cut or has been brought to the surface, then it is necessary that you fill it with old cotton or a thread made from linen cloth, just as when you have pieces or roots without moisture; and strengthen that (the abscess) until the third day; and then process it and treat it with water from the ointments until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar in which you have soaked a piece of linen cloth, and place it on the area of the bleeding many times.
Based on the pattern you've provided and the similarities to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here is my line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
If it is in the winter season and the location of the abscess is near many nerves, then you should infuse powder in wine and oil, and place them on the affected areas.
But if it is in the summer and the areas are fleshy, then you should place powder soaked in water and oil or wine and oil on them, and let this be rubbed until the third day, as we have said, and then you should open the abscess and clean it, and administer to its care what is suitable for it until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary for the knowledge of the universal care of abscesses, but according to the way of distinction, I have already said how to cure each type of abscess specifically by individual chapters.
Chapter 41.
On the incision of abscesses that occur in the nape of the neck.
In the nape of the neck, small abscesses occur, and these are of the species of nodes that contain tunics on their faces; and the species of theirs are many.
And they are pimples, and among them are those that contain moisture similar to linseed. Based on the given text and your instructions, here's my best attempt at translating the sentence:
And in cutting all, and in extracting those there is no fear, as you should cut without causing a reaction of the bowels.
And the operation in cutting those is that you probe them with an instrument whose shape appears as follows, which is called an entromes, until you know what it contains.
Because if what it contains is humidity, then cut that with a section according to the length of a superficial section as follows:
And begin the section from the line of .B. to the line of .G. Once the humidity has been evacuated, then you should scrape that area where it contained the humidity, and leave nothing of that at all, because if too much is left behind, it will return if any cause remains.
And then submerge the wound in Egyptian ointment if it is available; otherwise, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it and leave it until another day, for with water you will corrode everything that remains of that membrane.
And then repeat the treatment on that wound with Egyptian ointment as needed and thoroughly if necessary, until you are confident that nothing remains of that membrane; then heal the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if an abscess has formed fatty nodes, then you should incise it as follows: And make a cross-shaped incision, and insert your fingers between the two lips of the incision, and push it out from all sides, and exert your strength in extracting the membrane that contains it.
But if your archery causes difficulties, then do as I have previously advised you.
And similarly, perform the incision and treatment of a calcified abscess as we have told you; and the incision on a calcified abscess is lighter, because it has little blood and little moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are in the head of certain men with whom there is no moisture; and the reason for this is that I once incised an abscess in the head of an old woman and found the abscess to be like a hard, rough, white stone, which could not be cut or broken, and if anyone were to strike it, they would be harmed. ︎
But in other abscesses that occur in the head, this is not the case, such as the abscesses that come to the heads of children and cause the reasons for earaches; but the incision of these should all be a superficial incision.
"And stop the bleeding of those from the lowest parts, so that the body is relieved of the illness in the lowest parts.
And promptly care for them with water that suits the one being treated.
"Chapter 42
"About the incision of scrofula occurring in the neck.
"Sometimes these tumors appear in the neck and armpits, and sometimes in the groin; and at times they occur in other parts of the body.
"And those that occur in the neck, and many of which are generated between them, all scrofula of these is within its own proper tunic, just as with nodes and tumors of the head, as we have mentioned.
"And the species of these scrofula are many, for some are lapidary, and some contain moisture, and some are malignant and do not obey treatment.
"Therefore, in the one which you see with good disposition upon touch, whose color of water that is evident is close to the color of bile, and it is increased in all parts, and it is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and it is not preceded, you should incise it with a superficial cut from above to below the body along the line of G, within the line of B. And cut that off from all parts, and extend two lips of the bile with an ounce, or with many ounces if you have need of them, as we have said in the tumors of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is of greater caution that the vein or nerve is not cut.
And let the probe not be too sharp, so that it does not cut your hand during incision, or disturb the patient, and do not cut what is not necessary to cut; for if you were to cut a vein or artery and prevent yourself from performing the operation, then press down on the wound with vitriol powder or other powders that stop blood flow, tighten the wound, and let it remain until the sharpness of the abscess subsides and the wound becomes softened and begins to heal. When the blood has been released.
Therefore, return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then inquire with your finger to see if there are any other causes of the scrofulous glands, so cut and clean them as well.
And if there is a large vein near the scrofulous gland, then it is advisable not to cut that gland from its root. Before that, it is advisable to bind it with a strong bandage and let it remain until it falls off by itself without harm.
And then fill the wound with clean old cloth that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
And if you cut away the entire scirrhous growth, then you should sew together both lips of the wound and cauterize it immediately to ensure there is no remaining excess tissue.
But if you see that there is still excess tissue due to the size of the scirrhous growth, you should understand that it is necessary to cut away its root, and then you will draw it out, administer a stitch, and do as it is said.
And for those scirrhous growths that contain moisture, perforate them with a superficial perforation here where you see the matured area of it, and place the perforation so that the pus comes out from below the body, as we have said.
And then administer another perforation, similar to the first one in size and shape, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And then when you see that the wound is already clean, at that point you should treat it with regenerative flesh ointment until it is healed.
Chapter .43
"From the incision of the pustule of an abscess within the throat.
"The ancients said this incision should be made in the pustule, and we have not seen anyone in our land who has done it.
And this is the transcription of their discussion.
But in patients with sensitivity, the extraction of the pustule should be avoided, because by doing this, all the veins and major blood vessels of the patient are here.
But in those who have abscesses cauterized in the mouth, throat or both ears, when the illness is not in the jaw, it is necessary to use the incision of the pustule to avoid loss that is caused by puncturing.
Therefore, when we want to do this, we should incise the pustule leaving three circles of the pustule's circles, or four with a small incision in that which is between two circles by quantity, so that the incision be on the cartilage, not on the bone. And this place is suitable for incision because it is devoid of flesh and its blood vessels are thin.
And if the physician is timid, he should then extend the skin of the throat with a hook, and then split the skin until it reaches the channel, but avoid the blood vessels if you see any of them.
And immediately incise the kidney according to what we have recommended; it is indicated over the section of the duct for fire, which is from that exit with water that comes from it and by the absence of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the hour has passed that was feared for the puncture, add two lips of the wound, and suture it alone without the skin.
And then administer medications that promote flesh growth until it is healed.
And Ibn al-Qaysi says that the summary of the speech which we have reported is only this: see that some of these apostemas have already taken the voice of the patient, and the patient has come close to death, and his breath is dried up, and some go to incise the epiglottis so that the patient can breathe over the place of the wound for some breathing, and be saved from death.
Therefore, he commanded to leave the wound open until the evil of the illness is consumed; and the evil lasts for three days; therefore, then command to suture the wound, and cure it until it is healed.
And this is what I have seen with my own eyes: a servant took a knife and put it in his throat and cut off a part of the lung's cane, and I was called to care for him, and I found the woman as if she were dying, and I discovered the wound and found the blood that was coming out of the small wound.

Chapter 44
When an incision is made on the swelling that occurs outside in the groin area, it is called a hernia of the groin.
This swelling named hernia of the groin is a large swelling according to the color of the body and it is very common in women.
And it occurs in two ways: either naturally or accidentally.
In the natural case, there is no need for a cure.
And the accidental kind occurs in two ways: one is similar to large knots, and the other way is similar to a swelling caused by the obstruction of an artery, which is dangerous. And it is not advisable to assume that it is harmless unless it is small. And you should examine that and investigate it with the aforementioned methods. If you find it similar to large knots, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then you should incise it as you would with knots, and extract it with water that contains pell and bursilcam; otherwise, its entire being must be thoroughly examined, and then cure the place with healing water until it is healed.
Chapter 45
About the cutting of lymph node tissues.
Of nodes, there are many types and I have already mentioned all their kinds in the division.
And it is fitting that I recount here the difference between a node and an excrescence, as there may be doubt.
Therefore, I say that with an excrescence there is heat and fever and severe pain until the swelling of the excess is relieved; and it is a complete putrefaction when at that time the fever, the pain and the heat cease.
But with a node there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and I relate to you that certain type of lion which is in its own proper place.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a seed and it is made in this way, whether larger or smaller, and they are of two types: either they are fatty and contain moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many, as I have said in the division.
Therefore, when you arrive at the cure of the node, you must examine it and inquire about its beginning with an instrument called the probe, as will be explained in the following chapter.
And this is the method of inquiry for abscesses and all nodes: you take this instrument and insert it into the moistest part of the abscess, and you turn the instrument little by little until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
And then close your hand according to the size of the abscess, and then extract the pus and observe what comes out with it.
And if the discharge is watery, of whatever color it may be, then you should make a shallow incision as described for other abscesses.
And if there is no discharge from the pus, then know that it is dry.
Make an incision on it in the shape of a cross like this: As you have been taught, and hang it upside down, and scrape the skin from all sides carefully, and preserve the skin or bag, if possible, over that area, and extract the pus with a probe.
But if it bursts during the operation, it is not possible to extract all the pus, and you should observe this carefully, and then extract it little by little until nothing remains inside.
Because if any pus remains, whether a little or a lot, the probe will return according to the most.
And if you see that any small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp and strong corrosive powders, strengthen the wound, place a hot cautery on it, and treat it with another treatment until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, then you should sew together both lips of it and cure it with a medicine that heals flesh.
But if the vein is pulsatile and opposing, or non-pulsatile, then you should tie off and fill the site with dry trixate of vitriol and let that stay for two days or three until the wound improves and the ebullition of the blood subsides; and then return to cauterize what remains of the node.
Chapter XLVI
Of the forms of the instruments necessary for incision and perforation.
These are the forms of the instruments, which are of three types: one is large, one is medium, and one is small.
The form of the large instrument is as follows:
The form of the small instrument is this:
They should be made of iron, with polished edges and points, so that they fit neatly into the openings.
And these are the forms of the probes, which are called albard and one of them is called bistoury.
And they come in three sizes: large, medium, and small.
The form of great experience, the form of him.
The form of medium-sized experience, the form of him.
The form of little experience, the form of him.
Thus it is appropriate to be for those apostemas and exits and fistulas and bubos, so that among these are of the bones and of other causes.
And thus are made rounded, large, and long, like great needles with which the sails are sewn, and they are made of copper or iron or silver, and the best ones are when they are made of copper.
And they are made the experiences with black feathers, which they agree that through these the fistulas should be opened in the cavity of which they are reflected, that they should be reflected with their lightness into those reflections.
And they come in three types, some of which are long, and others medium-sized, and others short, according to the width of the fistula and its narrowness.
The form of the great experience with lead.
The form of the medium-sized experience with lead.
The form of the small experience with lead.
The forms of the hooks are of many types, for some of them are simple, having only one curve, and they come in three sizes: large, small, and medium-sized.
And from them are cut herbs, and of three spices.
And from those that have two curves are cut, and of three spices.
And from them that have three curves are cut, and of three spices.
And all these are necessary in their place.
Shape of a small single incision, shape of it:
Shape of a large incision with two curves: Shape of a mid-sized incision with two curves. Shape of a small incision with two curves.
Shape of a large incision with three curves.
Shape of a mid-sized incision with three curves. ️
And these are the shapes of the scalpels with which nodules and warts are cut and scraped, and they are of three types: large, mid-sized, and small.
"Grand scalpel":
"Form of a smaller scalpel
"Form of a small scalpel.
"The extremities of those [scalpels] with which sections are made are sharp, and the other extremities are blunt, and they are not placed in such a way that there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve during the skinning of the nodes, so that the patient may be healed and find a little comfort from the heat caused by the excoriation of the abscess.
"And these are the forms of cauteries, and there are three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
"They are made of iron and resemble a ray [fish] with which alcohol is applied.
"And at the end of the pointed extremity there is a hidden spatula, and in this way it cuts both inside and outside, as you wish.
"The forms of spatulas, which are hidden between the aforementioned [cauteries] and are used for the perforation of abscesses without the patients noticing, come in three sizes: large, medium, and small. And these are the forms of those.
The forms of ulcers through which blood flow is blocked, and there are three types: large, medium, and small. The forms of these are:
They are made of copper or brass, round with some length, and they are subtle.
And you should have these types of ulcers in large, medium and small quantities, so that through those you can quickly block the blood flow when necessary, and then it will not be medicine at first.
However, do not use them to block blood flow in all parts of the body, and use them only in fleshy places, such as on the skin of the thighs and buttocks, and on the skin of the arms, and the breasts and belly and shins, and similar to their fleshy counterparts.
And sometimes these instruments are made in smaller sizes similar to needles used for phlebotomy or incision of veins or arteries.
And sometimes they are made round like this:
Chapter XLVII
"Of the care for the nipples of men that are similar to those of women.
"Sometimes the nipples of some men swell as they begin to sleep, and then the nipples swell and resemble the nipples of women, and they are reddish.
"And for that person who has this condition, it is necessary to incise that area with lunar section in this manner, from the line of .B. into the line of .G., and then scrape off all the redness, and then fill the wound with a carminative medicine, and then close the two lips of the wound with stitching, and care for it until it is healed.
"But if the nipple turns downwards and softens due to its size as it should for women, then it should be cut into two halves above, with two incisions similar to a lunar shape. Each of these should be contained within the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller one according to this form from the line of .B. to the line of .G. And then scrape off the cord that is between the two lips of the wound, remove the pus, and administer what we have said about the stitching and powders necessary for the cure until it is healed.
E si tu non conpleysses la inscizio de aquo que cove inscidir per la inquietut del malaute, e per flux de sanc,
Based on the provided context and the similarity of the language to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation attempt for "Capitol .xlviii.":
"About the bursting of abscesses that come after tickling.
These abscesses that occur after tickling are of the species of scrofula, hard, and contain a core that is removed.
And of these [abscesses], some contain moisture; and those that contain moisture should be incised with a lunar section according to this figure: from the line of G to the line of B. And when all is evacuated from the abscess, i.e., the pus, then you fill it with cotton wool and leave it for another day.
And then the cotton should be removed and the area treated with appropriate ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the species of nodes or scrofula, then you should incise it in the same way as we said in the section on scrofula.
But if the wound is extended so that it may become gangrenous, then administer to him a cautery as we have said before.
Chapter 49
"On the incision of abscesses that occur from shooting or a vein.
When a bowstring is broken and the tendon above it is consolidated, then many times an abscess occurs. And the signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are from artery or vein: for when the abscess is from a bowstring, it is long in the body; and when you impinge on the abscess with the fingers mentioned, you feel within it something like stridor.
And that which is due to a vein condition should be returned to the surface of the body.
And cutting into this abscess is a mistake, especially in the areas below the armpits, the groin, the neck, and many other parts of the body; and it is very large, so its treatment with iron should be avoided, and that which is in the extremities or the head should be avoided.
However, when it comes to those caused by the swelling of the opening of the anus, make a longitudinal incision in the coccyx; and then widen the incision with hooks near the anus, and free the membranes until it is exposed.
Then place a needle over it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tighten the anus with double thread in two places – which method I have seen used for the extraction of two anuses in the temples.
Then press the area that is between the two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood in it comes out and the abscess is dissolved.
Then administer treatment consisting of powder until the ligaments fall off, and then cure it with suitable ointments until it is healed.
Based on the provided context and language similarities to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
"However, if you fear that the thread might come out, then insert the needle with a little oil on its point into the entire area of the boil, and strengthen your threads in four places.
"Then dry the boil in the middle of it until when it comes out, you will incise the excess of the string and leave what is attached to it.
"Then place over the boil a poultice that you have soaked in wine and oil, and then administer the treatment which is made with clay and ointments until it is healed.
"Chapter on the boil caused by a twisting of the nerves.
"So it happens that a boil occurs in the artery and in the vein, and similarly a boil occurs in the nerves when there is a blow to them or an excessive effort, and likewise.
"And it affects the most in places of the joints or heel, or in any place where the joints are swollen.
"And it is a severe boil, and it resembles the color of other parts of the body, and it is in its most disposed places without them, and when it is narrow with intensity, the patient feels something similar to numbness.
And if there is not an abscess formed in the chest, and therefore the intestine is left, and he is taken away completely without going to the anterior or posterior parts of the body.
Therefore, in cases involving joints, it is not advisable to be treated with iron, because it will cause great contraction quickly.
But those that are in the head or forehead should be removed with a spatula. However, if the abscess is small, then take it with scissors and incise it according to reason.
And if it is large, then suspend it with hooks, and evacuate it, and then remove it; and then close the wound with stitches, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter 2.
On the incision of an abscess that occurs in the stomach.
Indeed, many people are seen with those [abscesses] in their stomachs and other parts of the body of these people, which are called fungals due to their similarity to mushrooms, whose cause is subtle and the head of it is large; and already its lips have turned black, and it is small, and it is very prominent.
Here's my attempt at translating and interpreting this sentence:
And already the lips of those were swollen and split, and moisture ran from them constantly.
Therefore, I cut into them and found that one contained eighteen ounces of pus, while the other contained six ounces.
And the operation for cutting into them is as follows: consider if the patient is moist and the pus color is white and thin, of subtle texture; then you should cut with a broad lancet spatula, and there must be in your presence cauteries on fire, because many times you must remove much blood from it; and if blood comes out, cauterize that.
And if you see that the patient is very afraid and fearful, beware of cutting with iron; rather take freshly made lead plaster, and apply it strongly with that pus, in the manner that we have mentioned; and leave it for two days.
And then tighten the lead wire in the stricture; therefore, do not stop strengthening the large lead on the pus, until it is cut and falls out by itself without effort.
But if the pus is of coarse texture, then in cutting it there is some cause for fear and dread, especially in that which is in the abdomen.
"However, it is possible that you will incise the majority of it, and then immediately cauterize to prevent its return.
"Then care for him until the wound is healed.
"And be careful not to incise that which is of dark color, with little sensation, and irregular edges, for that is also cancerous.
"And I will come back shortly to remind you about this.
"Chapter 52." (Assuming the text uses Roman numerals for chapter numbers)
"On the treatment of swelling of the navel.
"Swelling of the navel is caused by various factors: either by fissures of the intestine that lies over the stomach, and out comes the membrane or bowel as in other ruptures; or by blood that flows from a vein or artery as mentioned before, or by trapped wind.
"However, if it is due to fissure of the intestine and protrusion of the membrane, then the color of the swelling resembles that of the body; it is painless, and it appears in various positions. "And if it is due to the emergence of the bowel, then its position with respect to that which we have described is of even greater diversity, and when you press on it as described above, it disappears, and then returns; and it is very light and easily moved by the touch of a bath or intense labor.
"But if due to moisture, it is soft and not hidden when you press with your hand, nor is it tightened or swollen.
"And if it is due to blood, then with these signs the abscess will appear in dark color.
"But if it is due to flesh, then the abscess is severe, large and hard, and it feels like a certain mass.
"But if it is due to windiness, then touching it feels soft.
"And the treatment for it is that you should consider whether the swelling of the umbilicus is due to blood from an arrow or vein, or windiness; in which case you must be prohibited from treating it, because there is fear and danger as I have taught you in the chapter where I spoke about abscesses caused by arrows and veins.
"And if the swelling of the umbilicus is due to the intestine or hernia, then you should command the patient to hold their breath and remain motionless; and then mark with your finger around the entire umbilicus, and then command them to lie on their back between your hands on their shoulders, and then surround the umbilicus with a cloth soaked in oil on the spot that you have marked with your finger; and then extend the majority of the abscess towards above with a large bandage; and then bind around it tightly with a strong thread or rope, using the appropriate method for binding.
And then lift the middle of the swollen area over the bandage and insert your finger into that hole; and if you have found and secured it with the bandage, then extract carefully and push the intestine back inside the abdomen.
And if you have found the intestine, then take it with tweezers; and remove its excess parts.
But if it is against your bowel or vein, then go around that area and return to your operation; and take two needles and put strong thread in them, and insert the needles into the circle you have made around the swelling in a cross-shaped manner, making them penetrate; and then strengthen the swelling in four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place open so that the stretched flesh may swell and fall by itself; or cut that part when it is softened and drained, and then cure it with water from the appropriate ointments until it heals.
And if the swelling of the navel is due to nothing but flesh or moisture, then you should extract the pustule as we have said and remove the blood or moisture found in it, and then cure that area with water that solidifies the place.
Chapter 3
About the treatment of crabs.
We have already mentioned, in the division of species, about the type of crab and how it is approached for treatment with medicines, and that surgery is recommended to prevent ulceration; we have also mentioned that crabs are generated in the mother's womb and the care required for treating them.
And the ancients said that sometimes crabs are in places where they can be eradicated, such as on the head which is on the breasts or in the cavity and resembles the members to extract all of it, especially when it begins small.
But when it is old and large, one should not approach it, because I have not been able to heal anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone else do so, nor has such a case come to my attention.
And the operation on it is when it is located as we have said, that you proceed by bleeding and purge with black hellebore some times, and then bleed him, if a clear swelling is found.
And then prepare the patient with the preparation in which he is located for surgery, and then prick into the wound with needles that are suitable for it; and then scrape cleanly from all sides with a good sharp knife until there is no cause left for its roots. And let the blood flow, do not absorb it quickly, and press on the wounds, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand or an instrument available to you among the instruments.
But if you face difficulty with the flow of thick blood from a vein or artery, then cauterize it until the blood flow stops, and afterward treat it with another treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 40
On the care of diabetics.
We have already counted, in the division, the types of diabetes from water, and the signs of each type, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the type of altitude alone, and it is not suitable to apply iron to the type of tympanites or the type of hypothermia, because that is fatal.
And when you have treated this type of tympanites diabetic with medicines and your medicine does not work, then consider that if the patient has already been weakened, or has another diabetes or ailment such as cough or abdominal pain similar to those, then beware not to treat them with iron, for there is fear concerning that.
"But if you see that the patient is overflowing with vitality, and with him there is no other illness except for dropsy alone, and he is neither a child nor an old man, then the manner of operating on him is to lift the patient between your hands, and to minister to him you should press his belly with your hand, and peel off the water from beneath the navel, and then take a thistle spatula according to this form:
"It should have two long pointed ends, like a spatula; however, there should be some small narrowing gradually along its length, so that during the operation you do not enter into the intestine and harm it.
"And then consider if the generation of dropsy is from the intestines, for then you should make an incision away from the navel on the right side under the bellybutton.
"But if the generation of dropsy is due to a liver illness, then your incision should be on the left side of the navel for three fingers' width.
"And if the generation of it is due to the spleen, then your incision should be on the left side.
"And it is not necessary that your incision be on the side where the patient wishes to lie, so that the excess fluids do not flow freely to that place.
And then perforate the entire spine with the instrument, and then insert it into that section, and raise your hand with the spatula between the spine and the bladder, and you extract it; and if the quantity is of a nail or its surroundings.
And then perforate the bladder until the spatula reaches the empty space, which is where the water is located. And then extract that and insert an instrument of this shape: And it resembles a subtle silver cannula; it is made of silver or iron or bronze. At its lowest point there is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes: two on one side and one on the other side. The end of it is sharpened like a feather, as you see:
And at the uppermost end of it there is an armilla, because when the instrument reaches the water, then that immediately falls onto the instrument, and thus it evacuates the most precise quantity of water in the hour, for if you evacuate more than necessary in the hour, you will cause the patient to die from a loss of their vital spirit, or you may cause them to enter into a state known as five fingers, which is close to death.
"But evacuate him according to the strength of his virtue, and based on what the disposition of the patient's pulse and his goodness indicate to you.
"Then remove the instrument, and hold the water which causes it so that it is immediately retained by the chain which draws the track that is on the hip of which you are told to pierce in that manner.
"Then repeat the procedure with the instrument on another day if the patient tolerates it, and extract a small amount of water each time, doing this for several days as a precaution. Be careful to ensure that only a little water remains.
"But if you fear for the patient and leave a large amount of water, then treat that with a burial in hot sand, and immerse it in a bath, and expose it to the sun for a long time; and treat it with drying medicines until it is healed.
"And cauterize the stomach and the spleen near the area where the water is extracted, as I have previously mentioned.
"Chapter LV
"On the treatment of infants whose urethral openings are not perforated.
Some times, one of the infants is born from its mother's womb and its head is not fully formed (or it is narrowly or not in its proper place).
Therefore, it is necessary to pierce the infant with a needle as soon as it is born, using a very thin spatula in this manner:
And then place a thin lead needle into the hole and tie it off, and leave it there for three days or four.
When the infant wants to urinate, it should be raised up to urinate; then return the needle (into the hole).
And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine which goes over the area will not leave this hole (or will block it).
But that one whose hole is narrow should be treated with a lead needle as we said, for several days until it becomes enlarged.
However, those in whom the hole is not in its proper place are called hypospadias, because in these cases, that which is born, the hole is at the end of the penis, so that he cannot urinate in the normal manner until he raises his penis with his hand above; and it is not a generative organ, because semen cannot reach the mother properly, and it is a very serious illness.
And the manner of the operation on him is that the patient be placed face down, and then extend his penis with your left hand with strong extraction, and incise the head of the penis at the location of the pubic hair with a sharp spatula, in such a way as if cutting a quill, or that you leave no part intact, so that the middle of it comes out resembling the head of the penis and that the skin falls into the middle place as needed.
And be careful in your operation of bleeding, for it often happens; and apply something to him that stops the bleeding, and care for the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56
Of the swelling that occurs in the foreskin on the head of the penis, and of the rotting, darkening, and sticking of the foreskin to the head of the penis.
This swelling in the penis often occurs as an excess growth of flesh.
And of these, one is malignant and the other is benign.
Benign, it is necessary that you suspend [the affected part] with a subtle hook and cut away until it becomes entirely bare; and then place a cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment on it; and then treat it with diachylon ointment until it is healed.
And if the ulcer is malignant and of dark color, then it is necessary that you administer a cautery near its edge and its cause.
And if the ulcer is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised penis, and one part of the ulcer is inside the foreskin while the other part is outside, then it is necessary that you remove the ulcer which is inside first until it heals; and then you treat the one outside. Because when you treat them together, it is not certain that the foreskin will not be damaged.
And if this happens in the genitals and on the foreskin with blackening and corruption, then it is necessary that you scrape off all that has turned black and will become corrupted or has already become corrupted; and then line the affected area with a mixture of honey, flour made from grated and sifted pomegranate rind.
And then treat it with another remedy until it is healed.
But if there is bleeding, then administer a lunar cautery in this manner:
because the healing cautery serves two purposes at once, which are to stop bleeding and to heal the wound when it is corrupting.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed at that moment, then you must insert a lead tube into the meat of the foreskin so that the patient can urinate through it.
And in the case of adhesion of the foreskin with the head of the penis (and this adhesion does not occur except in those whose foreskin is intact, and for whom circumcision has not been performed; and when adhesion occurs due to a wound or an abscess) it is necessary that you gently separate it with a blunt spatula until the adhesion is dissolved and the head of the penis is completely freed.
And if it is difficult to separate them carefully, then you must gently scrape some part of the head of the penis and the foreskin with a spatula, and this is because the foreskin, when it is thin, is easily perforated due to its delicacy.
And then separate the foreskin from the head of the penis with a thread of silk, which has already been soaked in cold water to prevent them from sticking together again.
And then it should be treated with six styptic powders until it is healed.
Certainly! Please provide the text for Capitol .lvii that needs to be translated.
"On the purification of infants and on the care of those who have undergone circumcision.
"Circumcision is not a cure for the disease in the same way as other ailments: but because it concerns our actions and our will, and especially since those affected are mainly infants, it is necessary to assign to this operation the best method and the gentlest way possible to preserve health.
"Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because they do not use it in their laws. And it is only because we have acquired this knowledge through experimentation, which is why I have found most craftsmen and barbers practicing circumcision and purification with a razor and with scissors; and they use bandages with thread and incisions with the nail.
"And I have already tried all these methods and found no better way of purification with scissors, with bandages made from thread as in purification with the nail, because often the skin slips off too much, because the foreskin has two layers, and the lower layer remains, and it is very easy to cause another incision and sure pain. And with the cleansing which is done by means of alphecati, and is digital, that which cobblers use, the circumcision of the end of the male member is not guaranteed, for it quickly enters its opening.
But in an operation with a nail, be careful and avoid iron and do not let your operation become corrupt. And the foreskin of a child is naturally short, and many times there is no need for cleansing, and I have seen this.
But the cleansing that is done with scissors and ligatures with thread, I have found by experience to be good, because the scissors are of proportional incision, for this reason the sharpness on top is just like the sharpness on the bottom; and so when you press your hand in proportion to these two sharp edges, and you cut accordingly in one movement; and it is done with a compression of the thread in the form that contains the foreskin of the penis from all sides, with which there is no error at all.
And the manner of the first operation is that you make the child stay more if he is one of those who understand a little, so that you do not proceed further than to tie the thread on his penis alone, and leave him until the next day.
"And then proceed with joy in every possible way so that they may regain their consciousness. "And then position yourself between their legs, prepared and not hesitant; hide the scissors in your hand or under your foot so that the child does not see them or any other of the instruments.
"And then insert your hand into their penis and blow through the urethra, and pull it out so that the head of the penis is exposed; and then clean it from any accumulated filth.
The shape of the forceps for modification is as follows:
Let the outer fingers be not cutting and the inner ones be cutting, so that the end of the nail is not exposed; let the length of the two sharp edges be equal to the length of two equally sized handles.
But the mistake in modification is when you completely or partially remove the tendon from it, you must reinsert it.
Therefore, you should extend that of your finger with your nail in front of the lesion and insert it according to its size.
And if you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with tweezers and insert it.
But if three days have passed and there is still something inflamed under the lesion, then you should let that be until the swelling subsides carefully, and then remove it with ease, and insert it as you have prepared it.
And beware of the head of the nail, for it will not be like that.
Therefore, treat it with a mixture of powders that we have recommended in the section on powders.
And if the tendon has been inserted too much or too little, and it follows the above instructions, it will not matter.
"And take care of that patient with the method we have described until he is healed.
"Chapter .58
"On the treatment of retained urine in the bladder.
"Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction due to a stone or congealed blood clot, or by a polyp or tumor, and it resembles that which we have described about the methods of treatment in the division.
"And if it is not dissolved with the method mentioned and a strong cause is made on the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction of the stone with an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: It should be of silver and have a hollow cone-shaped body, similar to a goose quill with the thinness of a ray's wing about one and a half palms long, on the end of which there is a fine hole.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And make the patient sit on a saddle, and insert into his bladder and penis olive oil mixed with water.
And carefully insert the catheter until it reaches the tip of the penis; then bend the penis down towards the navel; and then push the catheter into that; and then push that until it reaches the bladder, and this should make the patient feel relief, and if it is not done in this order, it means that there is an obstruction in the channel through which it passes.
And then gradually extend the thread with wool little by little, because the urine wets the wool.
Then extract it and do this as a treatment for urine retention, using the catheter; keep doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter LIX.
On the method of enema for the bladder with a syringe and similar instruments that are suitable for this purpose.
When there is an ulcer or abscess in the bladder, or congealed blood, or tight constriction, and you wish to distill water and medicines into it, then use an instrument called a syringe, and this is what it looks like:
"Until it is closed at its extremity, then it is considered complete. And in that there are three holes: two from one side, as you see.
In the beginning there is a hollow space where something is deposited, and according to its quantity it is expelled without addition, until some cause draws the humors with it, and when it is expelled, it is drawn out again with that, and when it is expelled far, like the catapult which in naval battles throws naphtha.
Therefore, when you want to prevent humidity in the bladder, insert the extremity of the catapult into the humidity and draw out the water that is pushed towards the upper parts, because the humidity is drawn into the hollow of the catapult.
Then insert the extremity of the catapult into the penis as we have recommended in the surgery; then expel the humidity with what you expel, because that humidity goes to the bladder immediately, and the patient feels it.
The shape of the subtle crystal with which the bladder is crystallized, and this is its form:
And whether it is made of silver or brass, its head should be like a small feather, and then thread it inside gently.
And then take the urinary bladder of an animal, place in it the moisture that you want to crystallize within the bladder, and then tie it strongly between two [pieces] with double thread, and heat that moisture over a fire.
And then insert the end of the crystal into the penis.
And then press your hand over the bladder with the moisture until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; and pierce it all around its circumference; and then insert strong thread into those holes, so that they are turned over; and then add the circle in such a way that it is tied securely, because you place in it whatever you want of the moistures, oils, and waters.
And then tie that [parchment] to the instrument and do with it as you have done with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
"Capitulum LX" or "Chapter 60". This likely indicates that this is the 60th chapter in the medieval medical treatise.
"On the Extraction of Stones." This phrase suggests that the chapter deals with the process of removing stones from various parts of the body, possibly through surgical methods or other forms of treatment prevalent during medieval times.
"We have already mentioned in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, as well as the difference between stones generated in the kidneys and those generated in the bladder, along with the signs of these." This passage indicates that earlier sections of the treatise covered various types of stones found in the body and their respective treatments using medication. It also distinguishes between kidney stones and bladder stones, and mentions the specific signs associated with each type of stone.
"And we have mentioned the stone in which operation is performed with a hand, specifically using incision." This line indicates that there was a discussion about stones that require surgical intervention, where the surgeon uses their hands to perform an incision or cut.
"And the stone generated in the bladder specifically is the one that is placed in the bladder." This sentence clarifies that the stone referred to as being generated in the bladder is literally a stone inserted into the bladder, possibly indicating an intentional or experimental placement of stones for study purposes.  The term "ficada" implies that the stone was deliberately put there.
"And I will now describe this with a clear exposition and summary." This sentence signals the author's intention to proceed with a detailed yet concise explanation of the topic at hand, ensuring clarity and brevity in their description.
"Therefore, I say that the stone generated in the bladder is more commonly found in children; and one of its signs is that the urine coming from the bladder resembles water in its subtlety, and sand appears in it; and the patient feels pain in their penis, and they pass many small stones, and then it subsides; and with water they have washed their anus numerous times." This passage describes symptoms associated with bladder stones in children. The urine is described as being very watery and contains sand-like particles. The child experiences pain in the penis and passes many small stones before the condition resolves. Additionally, the child has frequently washed their anus with water.
And healing is easier in children up to the age of fourteen; it is difficult in the elderly. But in young people, it is more difficult because it lies between them.
And of that for which the stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, it is contrary to that.
Therefore, when we come to the cure of this, it is necessary at the beginning of the treatment to cleanse the patient with Christ's cross to extract all the fissure that is in their intestines; for this fissure sometimes prevents the passage of the stone due to its search.
And then the patient should be taken by the feet and shaken and moved around so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or moves from its place sometimes.
And then make that incision between your hands prepared, and his hands should be left under his parts, so that the entire bladder is made to incline towards the parts below.
And then seek it out and take it all out.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the open space, then quickly close it with a section over it.
And if you cannot reach the entire area with your touch, then it is necessary for you to anoint your index finger of your left hand with oil, whether the patient is a child or the middle finger if they are a young adult, and insert it into their anus. And search for a small stone that fits beneath your finger. And insert it little by little into the neck of the bladder.
And then press upon it with your finger, and expel it to the outside parts near the place where you made the incision.
And order the assistant to press the bladder with his hand; and order another assistant to extend the knees with his right hand, and with his left hand to elevate the scrotum that is beneath the penis, in the area where the incision is made.
And then insert a spatula shaped like this: And cut in it that which is between the anus and the penis, not in the middle place, but before the side of the left hip; and let the incision be on the stone, and your finger be in the anus, and let the incision be transverse, so that the external incision may be wide and internal narrow according to the amount of stone that is possible to remove, not more, for if you press too hard with your finger which is in the anus, the stone will be forgotten.
And know that there is a certain stone with angles and edges, which makes its exit from the body difficult.
And of this kind is a stone resembling a bean, and it is round, which makes its exit from the body easy.
Therefore, if it is the one with angles and edges, place it in the crack.
And if it is not so placed, then you should invent a tool for it or make a tool with a suitable handle, the tip of which should be like a file that you use on the stone, and do not waste time; or insert a thin curved instrument underneath it.
But if you cannot do so, then widen the hole a little bit, and if you see blood flowing out, cut it off strongly with powdered vitriol.
But if there are more than one stone, at the beginning press your hand against the mouth of the bladder and cut them out; then press a little bit further; and do the same if there are more than two small stones.
And if it is a large stone, it is unwise to cut it out with a large incision, for two reasons: either the patient will die or he will suffer from continuous urine distillation, because the area is not completely healed.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloes and dragon's blood, and strengthen it. Then place a cloth infused in oil and wine, or in hot oil and cold water, on it to help the abscess burst.
Then place the patient on their side and do not remove the bandage until the third day.
And when you have removed it, wash the area with water and some oil, then treat it with an ointment called deflux and another called diavolina until it is healed.
But if an abscess forms in the wound, hot and corrosive, and it appears as if the blood is frozen in the bladder, preventing urination (and this is known by the appearance of blood with urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, because if it remains, it will cause corruption of the bladder and putrefaction of the patient. ›
Then wash the wound with strong vinegar, water and salt, and with all sorts of opposing remedies that are suitable for the patient's healing until it is cured.
And it is necessary during all hours of the treatment that you lift both cushions and adjust the medicines placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and in the meat of the bladder, and it is placed within, and emptying urine is prohibited, then cure that with water as I have recommended before, lest by this treatment it causes excessive dryness; and I have experimented with this, and it is that you take an iron awl, the form of which is as follows:
With a triangular point, sharp, attached to a handle.
Then take some thread, and tie the bladder with it below the stone, so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the iron into the bladder, easily piercing until the awl reaches that stone. And turn the awl with your hand in that stone little by little, and you will pierce its hole until you make it come out on the other side; for the urine is immediately released.
Then press your hand over the area that is soft where the stone has exited from the bladder, because it is punctured and perforated with urine, and the patient is healed.
If this cure is not possible for you due to any reason that prevents it, then place a thread beneath the stone, and another thread on top of the stone. Then cut through the stone along the shaft between two ligaments. Then extract that (stone). Then untie the ligament and clean the coagulated blood from the wound.
And it is not necessary to tie the thread beneath the stone, but rather so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other thread above, because when the thread is untied near the edge of the stone, the chain returns to its place and covers the wound.
And for this reason it is necessary when you tie the thread above that you raise the chain to the divided parts above, or return to your starting point, and cover the wound as we have said.
Chapter 61.
On the extraction of stones from women.
Stones in women are rarely formed.
However, if a stone is seen in any of them, the cure for it is difficult and is forbidden by many methods.
One reason is that women are very weak. ‌
And the second (reason) is because you cannot find a woman who is skilled enough to assist the doctor when she is chaste or one of the married women.
And the third (reason) is because you cannot find a woman who knows this art well, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth (reason) is that in women the location of the incision on the stone is far from the location of the stone, so you need a precarious incision, and therein lies the fear.
However, if necessity forces you to do this, then it is necessary that you take a female doctor who is very skilled, and she is rarely found.
But if you are deprived of her (a skilled female doctor), then seek a cautious and subtle physician, or present a midwife who is well-versed in women's matters, or a woman who has some knowledge of this art.
Therefore, present her (the midwife or knowledgeable woman) and command her to do everything that you order her, from the examination of the stone at the beginning; the reason for this is that she should check if the woman is a virgin, in which case she should insert her finger into the woman's vagina and seek the stone. xspace The text appears to be discussing a medical procedure involving a stone (possibly a bladder stone) in a female patient. The reasons for using a female assistant are given, as well as instructions on what to do if a skilled female doctor is not available.
Therefore, if this is found, cut it off near its root, and then command him to urinate on it.
But if she is not a virgin, then command the midwife to insert her finger into the woman's vagina and press it against the stone, while placing your left hand on the bladder and pressing firmly.
Therefore, if this is found, it should be gradually drawn from the bladder's orifice to the outside with great care until it reaches the level of the hip joint.
Then urinate on that position at the top of the vagina so that it reaches the level of the hip joint from whatever side it is lodged in him, and place the stone in that location, and do not remove your finger from the stone until it is cut off underneath it.
And let the incision be small at first; then introduce the ray into that incision, and if you feel the stone, adjust the incision according to the size that you know will allow the stone to pass through it.
And you should know that the types of stones are many: for they can be small or large, smooth or rough, long or round, and have ridges.
So that you know how many spices are from him for what you indicate about what you want.
And if you see blood flow, place crushed vitriol on the area and leave it for an hour until the blood is absorbed, then return to your procedure until the stone has been expelled.
And make sure you have prepared with yourself the instruments that are mentioned in the removal of stones from men, so that you will be helped by those in your operation.
And if you see blood flow, and know that the bleeding is from an artery that has been cut, then place powder on the area and press it with poultices and a stricture, and do not move it; and let the stone be and do not remove it, for in this way the patient will soon die. Then heal the wound.
So when the bleeding has ceased after some days, and the area has healed, then you can return to your operation until the stone is expelled.
Chapter LXII
On cutting into a hernia sack.
A hydrocele is nothing more than an accumulation of moisture in the white bag that remains below the spermatic cord containing the testicle, and it is called a scrotum.
And sometimes it is in the fatty tissue that nature has prepared for it at the time of birth, until another egg is laid; and this is the tail of the genitalia between the white spot we mentioned earlier, and it is not so, but later.
And the cause of this hernia is weakness that occurs in the genitals, for which this material becomes infused into them, and sometimes it happens due to a blow struck against the genitals.
And this humidity has many colors, for its color may be inclined towards yellow, red, red, black and foul, or white and watery, and this is what is most common.
And the signs by which this accumulation of water is known are these: for if it is in the white spot we mentioned earlier, then the swelling will be round and slightly elongated, similar to the shape of an egg, and the genitals will appear, because the humidity presses against them from all sides.
And if the humidity is in the fatty tissue, then the swelling will be round like an egg, and thus it is believed to be another egg.
And if the humidity is between the tail of the genitals and the white spot, then it will be without sensation.
And when you wish to know the color of the humidity, then you test the color of the humidity in the abscess with a dark red cloth; and according to what appears on the surface of the cloth, judge what is inside it.
Therefore, when we come to the treatment of him with iron, it is necessary that we command the patient to be blood-let if possible for you, and empty his body of its contents.
And then he should be laid on his back on some high surface, and place thick cloths under him.
And then sit yourself on his left side, and command the assistant to be at his right, who will extend their finger to one of two sides at the corner of the groin and the beginning of the pubic region.
And then take a wide spatula, and split the corner of the groin from the middle place through the length to almost the pubic bone.
And the cut should be made equally straight and parallel to the line that divides the groin, until it reaches the white fibrous tissue.
And scrape it, and observe, and be careful not to cut through it; and your scraping with which you scrape should continue until it is suspended by the thinnest and most subtle tissue, and examine it thoroughly as much as possible.
And then pierce the bladder full of water with a large puncture, and extract all the water.
And then separate between the two lips of the section with scissors, and extend the bladder on the parts above; and do not touch the cord that holds the testicles, and cut the bladder in such a way as is possible for you. And cut it completely or in pieces, and especially its thin part, for if you do not examine the incision thoroughly, it is not certain that the water will not return.
But if the fluid proceeds from outside its cord during your operation, then when you have completed the section of the bladder, return it inside, and then adjust the two lips of the testicle cord with stitches, and then cure it as with other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the fluid corrupted by another illness, then it is necessary that you cut off the vessels that are above the suspensory ligament, and extract the fluid, and then cure it as we have said.
But if the water is gathered in two places at once, then know that there are two hernias; therefore cut that place as you have done in the other one likewise; and if it seems to you to be one operation, then perform it.
And next you should clean the blood, and insert between the sections wool soaked in oil or pure oil; place another piece of wool soaked in wine and oil outside; spread that over the groin area and the stomach; cover it with folded cloths and cushions, and tie them securely around with a bandage like this:
And then take two cloths and soak them with cotton in this manner; make the ends with which you press from the side or wet wool, and attach them securely around the crotch of the pants. Let one end go from the back to the buttocks, and the second from the beginning of the thigh, with two ends below and two other ends above, and all the bandages should be secured in the crotch of the pants.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with a cautery on the section instead of iron; and it is that you take a fine surgical cautery and incise with it the cord of the groin, and set fire to it according to what we have described until the white cicatrix containing the water appears. Then take the cautery in this manner: And it resembles Greek letters.
And then pierce with that lance, and wait until all the humidity has been expelled.
And then extend the lance with a hook, and scrape with a hook, and burn with a fine hot cautery; and cut as much as you can until you have removed everything; and be careful that the fire does not touch him.
And know that this operation is safer and longer-lasting against bleeding, and better than an operation with cutting.
However, if an abscess is found during the time of cutting or burning, or there is bleeding, then you should treat whatever opposition occurs to you for that, with the cure that is suitable for him, as it is said.
However, if the patient is weak and does not expect a second operation because of its horror, then administer a puncture as we recommend here; and it is when you are certain, based on what we have said about the signs, that this hernia is watery.
Then you should have the patient sit on a high stool, then pierce the abscess in its lowest part with a wide lancet, and keep the puncture according to the length of the body.
And it is an open wound through which all the water runs out.
Then place a cloth over the area and tie it securely to allow the remaining water to run out. And then treat it so that the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the release of water at that time, you should puncture it: and this is done only because the white film in the orifice of the wound prevents the exit of water. At this point, you must insert into the wound a pen or instrument with which water is drawn from wells, whose shape is described above; or place a small tube at the opening of the wound.  (Translated with assistance from DeepL)
Know that the water will return and should be collected again after about six months or a year; and when it is collected again, then it should be punctured in the same manner, because the patient will thus spend their days.
Chapter LXIII
Of incision upon a fleshy hernia and its cure
Know that in the incision of this hernia there is great danger of loss, especially in large subjects; for I have seen its dismissal and salvation by that method.
And I remember the operation in that case and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses are born in the bodies of those whose humors are disturbed, and this happens for several reasons: either due to acute, bitter superfluity which is infused into the humors, or due to a blow.
And its color matches that of the body, and pain is not found in it, and it is a serious abscess.
And if it is light, it is called "lapificada," of which the color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it is caused by the obstruction of the arteries, and by the inflammation of these so that its memory is already perceived, or by the inflammation of veins.
However, what is caused by the inflammation of the arteries is known by the dissipation of the abscess when you press it with your fingers; and it is not necessary that this one touches.
But that which is caused by the inflammation of a vein does not dissipate from it for any reason, even if you press with your fingers.
And it is possible that incision can be made on this type and on other flesh; and it is that you should cut the skin of the humors, and then extend the egg to the parts above, and extract what is in the white part, and deliver the suspenders of the vessels, and tie them off, and cut the suspenders after you have delivered everything from all parts of the egg.
Therefore, if the egg is already set with those cuts, then it is necessary for you to remove the egg and inject that [substance].
Therefore, if there is an adhesion between the intestines or between any of the abdominal organs, then you must cut away all that adhesion and insert a round probe.
But if there is a growth of flesh at the site of the adhesion behind it, then you must inject everything that belongs to it, and remove the egg as we have said.
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with lanolin-infused oil and wine; and then care for it with another dressing until it is healed.
Chapter .64.
Of the treatment of a hernia that comes from the bladder.
A hernia is a swelling wrapped in a similar membrane like a bud with the softening of the testicles, and it makes difficult movements and walking for the patient.  (Note: "vitz" can refer to either the bladder or the testicles, depending on context.)
And in the treatment of this illness, it is due to the fear that comes from what has been recalled before.
"However, it is necessary that we say operation in this way as the first did.
"And I say that it is necessary to place the patient on an elevated seat; then remove the suspenders of the testicles from their usual position; and then take the penis with your hands along with the scrotum; and let those other ministers, like you, extend them with a strong extension.
"Then cut through the right side of the vessels using a sharp spatula until the vessels are exposed.
"Then scrape off all parts in the same way as we have said for extracting arrows from the temples.
"Then place a needle with double thread in those [vessels], and tie it off at the first location where blood is seen, and tie it off again at the last of them. "Then cut through those [vessels] straight down the middle according to the length of the body, and extract what has accumulated from the foul and corrupt humors.
"Then treat the wound with a treatment for other wounds in which you want healing to occur, so that the vessels may fall out from which one of two testicles is darkened, for this is not harmful.
"But if all the veins are cut, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed or that the testicles be tied with the veins, so that the patient is deprived of all nourishment due to the cutting of the veins, and that they be embalmed, or that this be done so that he is not quickly reunited with them.
Chapter 65
About the care of intestinal hernias.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a section that happens in the thin membrane extended over the belly from the sides of the wonderful part of the belly, because some intestines exit through that opening and reach some of the intestines.
And this opening is either of the membrane or its thinning, and these two types occur for various reasons: by a blow, by a jump, by a loud noise, by lifting something heavy, or by similar causes.
And the sign of this, when it is by thinning of the membrane, is that it happens little by little over a long time, and does not happen suddenly, and it is an abscess inside the hernia because the membrane presses on the intestine.
And the sign of it is when it is by section of the membrane, for at first it causes intense pain suddenly; and it is an abscess that appears underneath the skin, and this is because the intestine has come out, and its body stays outside the membrane.
And sometimes the membrane comes out with the intestine, and this type of hernia is called "zirbal".
And sometimes it is caused by flatulence, and sometimes the intestine splits open, and here it is held back, and this is a great danger for the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of this condition with iron, there is fear because it is necessary to avoid castration in that case.
And the manner of operating on this is to command the patient to return the intestine with their hand to the inner parts of their cavity if they comply with its return, and then turn him over onto his side between your hands, and raise his legs.
And then stitch the cord, which is the cord of the testicles, on top, and cut the cord of the testicles entirely along its length; and then place in the two lips of the incision hooks according to how you need to open the incision with them.
And if the incision, according to the amount that is possible for you, allows the testicle to be expelled through it.
And then remove the remaining flesh that is left after the cord of the testicles, until the white hard skin of each part is revealed.
The text you provided appears to be describing a medical procedure related to testicles and hernias. Here's a line-by-line translation into English:
And then with the left hand take hold of the spermatic cord at the exit points, and with this, extend the white cloth in your left hand, and raise the testicle with the cloth to the section point; and command the assistant to extend the testicle further, and you dissolve the adhesion that is behind with a complete solution.
And instruct your assistants that there should be no cause for the intestines to be wrapped in the white cloth tightly. But if you find any such case, then you peel it off from the abdomen immediately.
And then cut into the area below the testicles so that blood and pus may flow out, as we have recommended in what we have said.
And then administer wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound; and apply the bandage as we have recommended (and sometimes a white cloth is cauterized, which we have said near the cutting of the testicles to prevent bleeding, because many times this happens). Leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
But if the fall is delayed, then dip in hot water and place it on top until it falls off as we have said.
And then treat the wound with the other remedy for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
On Hernia Ventosa (ventral hernia).
In this type of hernia, it has not been seen that anyone has been cured by iron.
And the first ones said that it is done in this way as we have recounted in hernia with six [parts]; which is that you lift the vessels near the section above that with ease for him; and then cut in the middle place around the aposteme with water that opens that, until the vessels fall.
And treat the wound according to what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the dislocation that occurs in the joints.
Sometimes there is a rupture in the joints as we have said, and you should immerse the area.
And do not give any cause for concern about the intestines in the groin area; and if there is, that is little; and it returns to its place at all hours.
But if the time is prolonged with water, it causes a narrow slit in the hip until the intestine descends into the hip; and this happens due to the extension of the hip, which is in the joints as we have said, because the hip is extended and then becomes softened and the area swells and protrudes.
And its treatment is with a pointed cautery, as was previously stated in the account of it.
And sometimes it is treated with iron according to this manner: and it is that the patient lies on his back between your hands, and then you dry the area of the rupture of the swollen protrusions with dryness through the length according to the quantity of three fingers.
And then strengthen the white cloth that is under the rope until it is revealed.
And then take the stick and place it on the prominent part of the cloth, and press it against the stomach.
And then kiss the two prominent places on the end of the stick of the cloth, and join one with the other using stitching.
And then remove the end of the stick, and do not cut the cloth completely, nor extend the hole, nor cause any other such as I will make you understand in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then treat it with the treatment for wounds, and when you cut the threads, clean it and restore the wound until it is healed; because the cloth is tightened and not properly adjusted to the prominence of the rupture.
And cauterization is better in this case, for it is closer to health.
Chapter 68.
On the softening of the spermatic cord of the testicles.
Many times the spermatic cord of the testicles in some men is softened because the flesh between it is softened, and its swelling is increased.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is prepared in its treatment to make the patient lie according to his side, and cut all of the softened cord above the natural cord; and then join the two lips with stitching.
And if you wish, in the beginning treat the excess of the softened codena with three or four cookings and a firm stitching.
And then incise between the sutures; and then treat with a cure for the other diseases until it is healed and the threads fall off.
Chapter 69.
About Castration.
You should know that castration is forbidden in our law, but I have been informed of it and will mention it in this book; the reminder is necessary only for two reasons: one, so that it be known to the physician when he is questioned about it, and that he knows how to treat the patient to whom it has happened; and the other reason is that we often need castration of other animals for our own benefit, such as with mules, oxen, pigs, and similar animals.
And so I say that castration is done in two ways: either by torsion or by incision and cutting.
However, in the case done by torsion, the way of operating is that we make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles are softened, lengthened, and hanging down. And then take those with your hand within so that they are resolved and do not appear beneath the touch.
And in the case of castration by incision and cutting, it is necessary that you hold the beast and press its spermatic cord with your left hand.
Then tie the suspending ligaments, and make an incision on each testicle with a single cut until two testicles are processed.
Then make an incision on those parts which you have already skinned. And do not leave any part of the intestines open except for the thin part which is over the veins.
And this method of castration is better when done by strangulation, because strangulation strongly prevents any cause of the testicles so that the beast does not desire to mate.
Then care for the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70
On the care of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men is according to two methods: one is that it appears where there is a space between the spermatic cord of the testicles, in which there is a figure like a woman's vulva with pubic hair.
And sometimes urine from that flow is in the duct of the testicles.
But in women it is different: the vulva of the woman on the perineum is like two men's testicles, a little smaller at the outer end, like a man's scrotum and two testicles.
And the treatment is of three kinds: two for men and one for women. And it is necessary that you insert those tightened meats to remove the pressure from them, and then treat those with the treatment for other diseases.
And in the second type of men, in which there is urine in the duct of the testicles, there is neither treatment nor operation for him.
Chapter XXI
Of swellings and protruding flesh due to causes in women.
A strong swelling is due to natural causes until it becomes stressed and is made with a bandage; and sometimes in some women, it grows so much that it spreads like in men and prevents intercourse.
Therefore, you should hold the excess swelling with your hand or a bandage and insert it.
And do not hesitate in incision, especially in the region of the vein, lest a flow of blood ensue.
Then care for it with remedies for wounds until it is healed.
But flesh born is flesh that does not leave the horrific appearance of the womb until it fills it, and is very light to exit towards the outer parts according to its resemblance (and for this reason some first called it “tail-borne malady”); therefore we must cut in this way as we cut lint, and care for it until it is healed.
Chapter 72
Of the treatment of arthritis.
Arthritis is when the woman's womb is not pierced or is only slightly opened. And it may be natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to a previous illness, which can occur from either improperly matched flesh or from subtle or thick vapors.
And it can occur in the region of the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or in its lower part, and it prevents sexual intercourse, pregnancy, and childbirth, and greatly hinders menstruation.
And the recognition of that is done by examining the abdomen. If there is distension, then it is promptly apparent; but if not, then you should search for it with your words or with the ray.
But if the distension is slight and close to both lips, then you should cut and disrupt it.
And you should place your fingers on both lips, and then place the index finger of each hand together.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs extended, and then spread both lips with force until that subtle distension is broken and the distention is opened.
And then take wool and dip it in oil and place it on the area, and have someone watch over it during the day to prevent the cut from healing.
But if the distension is large and thick, then it is necessary that you incise it with a lancet or with a myrtle leaf.
But if the distension is fleshy, then suspend it with hooks, and incise it.
And you should have with you the medicines that stop bleeding without biting, such as aloe, dragon's blood, and kermes oak, mixed with egg white.
And then administer a wide leaden tube so that the wound is not easily closed up.
Then hold it for several days and administer warm, dry cloths to it.
And then treat it with the other treatment for healing until it is healed.
And sometimes this occurs in the main birthplace of other flesh, and then it is necessary to proceed in this manner. However, if this is due to a cancerous abscess, do not make any incision in the main abscess in any way.
Chapter 73.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids and tail, and red pustules that occur in the vagina of women.
Hemorrhoids are appreciated from the openings of many veins, through which blood flows continuously; and when hemorrhoids are old and swollen.
And I have already said in the division the species of those and the signs of those, and I will say thus about those that receive treatment and those that do not receive treatment.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids and swellings, when they are in the main area and do not appear to be sensitive, then in those there should be no treatment with incision.
"However, those that are in the opening of the womb, upon which a cat senses something, are those that are cured.
"And it is advisable to place the woman in cold water and then thoroughly extend her with scissors or rough cloth, and cut those [growths] with the razor.
"And then sprinkle upon those [growths] the flow of blood from one of the caustic powders without biting, such as quicklime and similar ones.
"And then wrap her feet in cloth for an hour, and then place that [her foot] in cold water.
"And if the flow of blood persists, then make that person sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate peels and walnuts and similar things.
"And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice with water on the back of the patient.
"And if the blood is not stopped, it is good; and if not, apply two cupping glasses, and to the nipples without scarification.
"And then take wool and soak it in coriander juice or in hart's tongue juice or in sweet verbena juice with vinegar, and apply it to the area; and then heal the area with ointment until it is healed.
And ensure that he is healed.
Sure, I'd be happy to help translate more text. Please provide the next line or lines you would like me to translate.
And a perforation of the intestines occurs in the mother.
A multitude of species of boils occur in the mother, such as crabs and carbuncles, and leprous and ulcerous sores, and adhesive ones, and erysipelas, and fistulas with haemorrhoids, and gouty tumors, and buboes, and other types of boils. And I have already spoken of these diseases and their species and signs, and their cures in the division.
And I wish to speak in this treatise about the boil which comes in the mother when it is one of those that collects pus, and if you want to know in what manner its operation is performed with iron.
Therefore you should consider if the pain of the boil at its beginning is acute with throbbing and feverishness, and if it becomes red and if pressing on it causes pain, then do not cut it with perforation, and heal it with remedies that help in ripening until the sharpness of the symptoms ceases.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
Certainly! Let's break down the sentence and translate it step by step:
And it is necessary that when you want to administer this instrument, you insert it with the ray into the mother of the woman, and what enters the mother from the instrument should not be more than the ray of the mother, and leave the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the ray of the mother, then you should place poultices on the texture of the ray of the mother to prevent the entry of any instrument into the ray of the mother.
And it is necessary that you place the thread that runs along the instrument higher and that the one who administers holds the instrument and turns the thread until the orifices of the mother are open.
And when the excrement appears and is touched by hand and is hot and moist, then it is necessary that you dry it with the head of a broad spatula.
And when the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place on the wound a cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil, in which there should be some styptic; and place the bandage on the dry part in the ray of the mother.
And place outside the mother and on the pubic hair clean wool soaked in water, in which there should be boiled mallows.
And approximately it should be treated for about two days with an ointment that is suitable for this purpose until it heals.
And sometimes the mother (wound) and the sore are washed in such a way that they become crystallized with water and honey, and then with water in which there is boiled lily or long Aristolochia, and then it returns to the ointment.
And if the sore is deep within the mother (wound), then you must be prohibited from treating it with iron, having care for that person with water as we said in the division.
Chapter 75
To teach midwives how to treat pregnant women when they experience a miscarriage according to an unnatural shape or form.
It is necessary that the midwife knows in the beginning the natural shape or form of childbirth by its signs, and it is when you see the woman strain at the lower parts and desire to smell the air, and above that she is relieved because of what is coming out of her, and she hastens the expulsion of the fetus, then you know that this birth is according to a natural shape or form, and its emergence is with its head first, and secondly either hanging from it or suspended by the umbilicus.
When you see these signs, then it is necessary to press the abdomen of the woman so that the fetus descends slightly, and when they descend on their head, give them a second push, and remove those excesses with good cleaning.
But that which is other than this part is unnatural and not praiseworthy, because when the fetus exits feet first and its body comes out in front of its head and feet, or one hand at its foot, or the head comes out along with one hand, or at its belly, it quickly turns on its neck, and it resembles the figures of the unpraiseworthy.
It is necessary for the midwife to be wise and discerning in all these matters, and to guard against error and deception.
And I am showing all the figures of these, and which way is in them so that it may be signified by this and may have been done thus.
When the fetus comes out with its head first by natural progression, and that is strong in the woman and difficult for her, and sometimes her strength is weakened, then do this thing, or let the women have it, and evaporate its head with boiled fenugreek and moist oils.
And then insert the spoon between their teeth, with a small spatula and cut it with that, or dry it with your nail until all the moisture is gone from it. And press on the woman's belly until she gives birth.
But if she does not give birth, then it is necessary that the woman be anointed with a mixture of little chickpeas and fenugreek seeds.
Then command him to sneeze strongly with an onion held under his nose and mouth for an hour, because the baby will be born immediately afterwards.
And if both hands of the baby have already come out at the beginning, then it is necessary that you reduce them gradually with great care. But if it does not obey the treatment, then place the woman on a bench and lift her feet up, and then turn the bench upside down on the ground; and make sure the woman is held so that she does not fall due to the shaking.
And if the hands are not turned back inside and the baby dies, then cut them off and extract the remains of the baby or tie its body to its hand with cloth and pull it out evenly, because it will be born immediately afterwards.
When the child is born feet first, then you should gently push those (feet) upwards, and then turn the baby, and then guide it out, and then take one of its feet and gradually pull them out.
But as it has been born into the thighs, then you order it to be pressed, and make it cough with conditions, because it will surely come out if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled with what we have recommended, then you gradually return the baby until you place it according to its natural figure, because it will surely be expelled with easy delivery.
And if it is prevented by all that we have recommended, then take of aloe and dissolved gum, and crush it well in the mortar, and then anoint with water the woman's vulva, as low as her belly. And then make her sit in warm water until she reaches the hips.
And when you see that the parts separated from it are lubricated, then make him undergo fumigation of myrtle and place it underneath him. And when you have sub-fumigated him for an hour, then you let him sit on a chair, and then make him sneeze and expel the breath from his mouth, and remove that [substance], and press gently on the lower part of his abdomen with light compression, because this causes immediate evacuation.
"In this way, the patient is hanging by one of his hands. "Try to reduce the dislocation of their hand, but if you cannot reduce it, then raise the woman and make her go.
"And if she cannot go, then make her lie down on the bed, and shake her limbs vigorously, and then administer plasters which I have recommended made of poultices.
"And if the birth has occurred, then make her sit on a chair, and study how to reduce the hand, and return the fetus to its natural position, and make the woman sneeze and command her to bear down until she is delivered.
"And so the baby, with its hands spread open, lies face down on its mother's back. "Have the midwife take the baby's hand and then roll it over gently, little by little, until it comes out easily.
"And when it is all turned and pushed back in, then place on its wound what we have recommended of oil and poultices.
"And then command her to cough little by little, and when you have done that, then make her sit on a chair and command her to lean over her right side, and then command her to bear down; and make her sneeze with caution. The Latin phrase "Exitus foetus praeparati super latus" can be translated into English as follows:
When they start to feel horror from the mother according to this manner, consider [it], and then you should cut a little incision with your nail until it is drained of its moisture.
And if the fetus is suspended over the face and neck of the mother, then you should cut into the navel, so that it is not retained and can be born.
Then you should help the fetus to emerge by parts until you place it in the correct position, and tell the woman to push strongly, and the infant will come out easily with a slight effort, if God wishes it so.
Exit of twins or many fetuses. Know that twins are born with many efforts, and sometimes three or four [are born], but this is rare and late; but there are five causes of it, which are not alive.
And tell about them, whether they are multiplied or not, one incision is made, and they are separated by a small cut, distinguishing those [twins] between the ligament in the navel of each of them. And sometimes they come out as if it were a single fetus by natural easy effort, and sometimes they come out by unbearable effort as we have said.
And if some [problems] are difficult during childbirth and they reach the point we mentioned about unnatural figures, then you should treat them as we have described.
And if the midwife is skilled and performs this with ease and skill, slowly, and arranges it according to every figure as it has been prepared by the uterus, leading towards health.
Remembering that which forms in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
Sometimes a mother will form [fetuses] one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, even ten, and it has been verified to me that one woman aborted and delivered six, and another delivered ten all formed, which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise.
And all this should be in the knowledge of the midwife because she easily recognizes the appearance of these things, and therefore she arranges herself for it as is necessary.
Chapter LXXVI.
Of the extraction of the child when it is dead.
When you treat the dead child as we have mentioned in the division of treatment and it has not yet exited, and you are forced to use manual operation, then you should consider whether the woman is of sound health and not with any of the accidents by which loss is feared for her.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the sentence:
And let the assistant hold it [or be tied] in two parts or in the bed, so that his body does not extend beyond the extraction of the fetus.
Then you should moisten the mother's mouth with oils, mulled wine made from althaea, fenugreek, and linseed.
Then the midwife should anoint her hands with those oils and mulled wine, then gently insert her hand into the mother, and then search with her hand for the location where the fingers can grip the fetus.
In such cases: then consider if the fetus is positioned head-down, and in that case, place your fingers in its heels, or neck, or mouth, or palate, or under the chin, or in the notch of the sternum, or near the ribs, or below the hypochondrium.
But if it descends feet first, then in the heel, or in the middle of the chest.
And it is necessary that he holds the fingers with his right hand, and places the curvature of [the fetus] in that place which is between the said words of the left hand, and gently insert the hand until the fingers reach one of those places which we have mentioned, up to the point where it becomes loose.
And then place and secure in the position of the patient another pillow, or a third if necessary, so that it is drawn equally, and not stretched according to its correctness only.
And let it be adjusted at every turn, so that the extraction of it is eased as it is done in a tooth when removing it.
And it is necessary that something be placed between them so that the stretching is softened; and if any part of it is retained, then the midwife should anoint some of her fingers with oil and gently insert them and turn around with what is retained.
Therefore, if the part of the child is stuck, then the pillows should be changed to where it is most needed; and do this until all of the child is delivered.
However, if the hand is delivered before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it due to its narrowness, then a cloth should be wrapped around that; and then extract that until all of it is delivered, and place it either in the joint of the hand or in the elbow.
And do likewise with the other hand and both feet.
If the head of the fetus is large, or if there is a cramp during delivery, or if the head is stuck in the birth canal, then it is necessary to insert a spatula with spines between the mentioned parts and split open the head and extract the water, or use an instrument called "alundat" to do so. The shape of this instrument will be similar to that of other instruments described in the nearby chapter.
Similarly, if the fetus has a naturally large head: it is necessary to cut that with scissors or take it out with an instrument called "alundat" as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head has exited but is still contracted, you must cut the perineum until the fluid that is in the feet has been released.
But if it is not complicated or does not obstruct the birth, then cut the head as soon as possible.
And if the abdomen is swollen or edematous, then you must puncture it until the fluid is drained from it.
But if the child is breech, then its descent will be easier and its direction towards the mother's vagina will also be easier.
Certainly! Let's break down the text and translate it line by line:
Mays si les autres membres so ostatz e torna le cap, lahoras la metrona entrometa la ma senestra; mays si la boca de la mayre es huberta, lahoras intrometa la ma en le preon de layre, e cerque am aquela le cap, e atira aquel am les dits entro a la boca de la mayre, e aprop entrometa en lu un unci, o dos uncis, e atire lu am aquels.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted by an abscess that occurs in the uterus, then it is necessary not to prick over it; rather, it is necessary to administer an infusion of wet and greasy causes first. And apply plasters; and follow the patient with waters that soften and moisten.
And if the birth is on the side, then if it is possible, let it be hooked: and let the waters that we mentioned for the living child be administered.
And if this is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
And it is necessary not to leave any cause inside the uterus.
And when you have completed all your operations, then administer the water that we mentioned for the care of the abscesses that occur in the uterus.
And if there is a flow of blood, then let it be placed in styptic waters and administer the other cure.
And I have already seen a woman in whose womb was a dead child, and on top of that another living child was found, and also the other child was dead. There occurred in the uterus after a long time an abscess in the navel area; and it swelled until it burst open, and began to produce pus.
And I was called to his care and treated him for a long time, but the wound has not healed.
Then I placed on him strong attraction plasters for some reasons, and an bone came out of him, and after a few days another bone came out; and I was greatly amazed, since there are no bones in the abdomen.
And then I thought that they were the bones of a dead fetus.
Therefore I examined the wound and extracted from it many bones, the woman being in her thirties, and she had lived in such a way for a long time; then a small piece of arm came out of her.
And I did not consider this to be strange, but rather that it is a sign and aid in what the physician works with his hands for the administration of care.
Of the shapes of the instruments necessary to extract the fetus.
Shape of the uterus with which the womb is opened:
This is the shape of a stretcher on which the lips are cut, and at this cutting there should be two uteruses in the two ends of the feet. However, this uterus must be more subtle and narrower, and should be made either of olive wood or boxwood.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And these two additional elements should be inserted into the mouth of the mother so that she is opened with them when you rotate the two prescribed wheels.
Another form similar to it, but more subtle and lighter:
It should be made of ebony or boxwood according to the likeness of forceps. However, at its end there are two elements like this, and the length of those elements is about one palm, and the width of each is two digits.
And when you want to open the mother with them, then make the woman lie on her back with her legs hanging off, opening what is between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument in the same way as you do with forceps, according to the amount of the mother's vagina opening that you want until the midwife does what she wants.
The form of the wheel which they called the ancients:
A pushing form with which the child is pushed out.
A compressing form with which the large head is compressed.
And it resembles forceps, at the end of which are teeth like this, and sometimes it is made long like forceps according to this form, like this, with teeth like sawteeth with which it is cut and compressed. "Form of brief statement:
"Form for those who have a thorn:
"Form for those who have two thorns:
"Form of spoon with two ends, with which the head is severed.
"Form of two wide spoons:
"All these instruments are exercised, and the more the species of them are multiplied and prepared by the craftsmen, the easier it is for their operation and the more useful they are to men in their quantity.
"And you should not lack any of these instruments, wherever you may be, because the need for them cannot be excused.
"On the removal of the afterbirth.
"When the afterbirth is retained during childbirth, then you should command the woman to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze by conditions, and strengthen your hand over her mouth and nose, and if it comes out this way, it is good.
"And if not, then you take a cloth and pierce a hole in it and place on that [cloth] herbs that burn the mouth of the mother, such as calament, rue, anise, chamomile, dried grapes, cinnamon wood, and St. John's wort. Based on the context and similarity to other Romance languages, here's a line-by-line translation:
And then place a reed cannula in the mother's mouth and hold it there until the steam reaches the cavity of the womb.
And then make her sneeze as we've said, and the fetus will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment is continued and the fetus does not come out, then order the midwife to submerge her left hand in sesame oil or an althea mixture. And then introduce it into the vagina and search for the fetus with her hand. When you find the fetus, take hold of it and extract it slowly. But if it is attached to the mother's womb, then proceed as we have recommended, and when you find the fetus, extract it little by little straight out so that the mother does not suffer from a strong contraction. It is necessary that the right and left sides of the ribs be easily moved.
And if the mother's mouth is blocked, we have recommended treatment with sneezing and a mixture of herbs in olive oil.
Here's my attempt at translating the sentence:
When the patient is lifted, it causes a harmful force to be exerted on the head and stomach, which harms the patient; therefore, at that time, it is necessary to administer fumigations and appropriate remedies.
Moreover, some of the ancients have already experimented with fumigation using dried figs and myrtle.
The method for fumigating a woman to induce menstruation and second birth (miscarriage) is as follows:
It should be made of glass or iron.
The thin end should be placed in the woman's vagina and the wide end over the fire, with the fumigation material placed on the coals of the fire.
And hold it in place until that fumigation is consumed and then replace it with another.
Of the treatment for an infant's non-perforated anus.
Some infants are born with their anuses not yet perforated, which is a delicate and rare condition. Therefore, the midwife should pierce that opening with her finger; if not, she should use a sharp probe, taking care not to touch the sphincter muscle.
And then apply over that wool soaked in wine and oil; and then treat it with an ointment until it heals.
But if you fear that it might become inflamed, then place in the wound a tube for several days, and remove it when the child wants to eat.
And if inflammation of the anus occurs due to the consolidation of a wound or an abscess; then that consolidation must be cut open, and it should be treated with water as we have said for healing and for the lead [treatment].
About the treatment of the fistulas that occur below.
The fistulas that occur in the lower parts are more numerous and larger, those which occur near the anus outside or in the space between the buttocks.
And it is a fistula or many.
And when that swelling becomes chronic and exudes thin, white watery fluid or subtle pus, and sometimes from these fistulas some are penetrating.
And those penetrating ones are known by what comes out of them through discharge and flatulence; and sometimes the patient suffers from discharge, and often worms come out of these.
And some of those fistulas can be seen penetrating into the bladder and into the meat of the penis; and some of those penetrations enter the joint of the thigh and into the knot of the testicle.
And that which is recognized as a penetrating fistula into the anus and not penetrating is that you insert your finger inside the anus, and then introduce a subtle probe of iron or silver into the fistula when it is not twisted.
But if in that (fistula) there is a twist, then introduce into it a subtle probe of lead or horse hair until you feel the probe or the hair in your finger.
And if you do not feel it completely or there is no discharge of pus, worms, or wind, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and thus approach the treatment.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the meat of the penis, then its indication is the emission of urine from there and the restriction of it so that the place may be healed with medicine.
But if it penetrates into the joint of the thigh or into the bone and there is pain in the circumference, then its sign is that a probe can pass through it if there is no twist into the bone, and pain in the circumference of the affected part; and that from it there is always pus; and that in that place no medicine works, nor is it healed with ointment.
And in all those cases of fistula penetration, it is not a cure for everything, and the treatment of these is the labor and futility of foolish doctors who are determined to treat them.
But in cases where it is not penetrating and is not old, healing with iron is expected, as I will recount to you, and which I have already proven.
And have the patient lie between your hands on his back and lift his legs into his chest, so that the cushions are inclined towards his belly, and then carefully insert a lead or iron probe into the fistula, until you know the location where the probe comes out.
And if the patient feels pain around the anus, then you should insert your finger into the anus.
And if you feel the probe already penetrating through your finger, or something between your finger and it feels like bone or flesh, then you know for certain that it is penetrating; and in this case do not attempt to treat it, because there is no cure for it, as we have said.
But some say that it can be cured in some men late on.
And the treatment by which help is hoped for in this case is that you take a fine cautery iron according to the width of the fistula, as has been said before, and insert it into the fistula until it reaches the anus; and then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those flesh-like canals have been completely closed.
Here's the line-by-line translation of the provided sentence:
And if the probe enters and does not penetrate into your finger which is in the anus, and between that and the probe there is a thin layer of flesh or skin, and sometimes a fistula appears on this surface of the buttock, then dry the buttock from the beginning of the fistula, and you will see it dries with the probe, and let the probe be inside the fistula until the drying reaches the place where the end of the probe reaches, and through the probe it is freed and cured.
Then thoroughly clean those fistulated flesh parts that resemble a pen feather and make sure none of them are left behind for any reason.
However, if blood flows between you and your operation when cutting those flesh parts, then use milk or a light pus instrument to cauterize with fire or sharp medicine, because cauterizing with fire has two good effects: it adheres the flesh together, and it dries out the moisture.
Then cover that with gauze wrapped in cloth or linen until the wound heals, and then cure the wound with an ointment made of tough meat, which stimulates growth and hardens.
And those medicines in which there is astringency and dryness; when it has been restored, it is already healed and you do not fear recurrence.
But if the fistula has already entered into the region of the anus and is extended from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and investigate with it.
And therefore if you see the opening and between you and it there is only a thin veil of skin or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then do not operate on it, but rather trust and hope for a positive outcome.
This cause should be treated in one of three ways: either by cauterizing it as we have said; or by drying it until you reach the cavity, so that it is possible for you to insert the instruments and the appropriate cure; and do not proceed with dryness alone, lest you incise the ligament containing the colon, causing involuntary discharge of feces from the patient. Then cure it with water as we have said, because a light cure will heal quickly. Or extend that veil and clean out that pus by drying it up close to the anus, either with a probe or with another sharp instrument, and then cleanse those fistulated flesh in the section where you can with perforation; and then strive to restore the entire wound with dryness. And if the orifice above is not healed, and the fistula remains open at the exit of the anus, it will be easier for the patient to pass stool. Sure, let's translate the provided text into English:
Based on the provided text and the pattern of similarities to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's my line-by-line translation attempt:
Certainly! Let's break down the text and translate it line by line:
And then care for the wound until it is healed and cured.
But if the orifices of the fistula are not penetrated, then make them penetrate by any means available to you, so that there is an opening in the skin, for it is not your place to do this to prevent infection; and then continue treating until it is healed.
The shape of the spatula used to open the fistula is curved at one end and flat at the other, so that it does not cause unnecessary damage, as seen before.
About the suturing of hemorrhoids when there is bleeding during their incision.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: those that resemble coal within the rectum, or those that are like a cluster of grapes. And these can be small or large, and the bleeding from them is continuous and intense, and they protrude outside of the anus, at its edges.
However, those that are outside the anus are of two types: some have a little moisture, from which flows citrus-colored water or a little blood with continuous mucus, and they are distinguished by the color of the mucus.
And the treatment for that which is inside the colon is to command the patient to sit and to press until the colon comes out and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Therefore, you cut and suspend with tweezers what you have those with your nail, and then incise them according to their roots.
But if the tweezers cannot be held on them due to their moisture and softness, then take those with a rough cloth or a blanket or a piece of wool, and extract them with your fingers, and then incise them and sprinkle some warm powders near the incision so that they act as a cautery for them; or cauterize them according to what has been said in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with another treatment until they are healed.
And if the colon does not obey the expulsion, then anoint the patient with a mild purgative ointment, and wash them with that water which is in the colon and which causes easy expulsion when the patient presses.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the colon, then their cause is light, and it is that you take those with your nail, or take them with tweezers, and incise them, and then treat them with the water mentioned until they are healed.
Here's my attempt at translating the given sentence:
And do this for all of them, but leave one out and do not pierce it, so that the excess blood can flow from that one.
Then place over the wound a cloth soaked in oil or wax; place that over the wound and instruct the patient to rest. Then leave it until it closes; when it is closed, cure those with ointment or another treatment until it is healed.
And when they are old and not worth treating with medicine, then you must scrape them with the tip of a spatula or with your nail until they become moist, and put a poultice on them to draw out the pus, which prevents them from healing; and then cure them until they heal. xspace
Then you remove them with a strong purgative so that they bleed and are scraped clean first; and then cure them until they are healed.
Know that ameisamir is called "nail", and it is not so unless it is a round wart the color of the body, like the head of a nail, and it occurs throughout the body but especially in the parts under the feet and arms, and you should treat them because of the pain they cause.
And then it is necessary to cut off that which is around the nail, and hold it with tweezers or pliers, and remove it from its root; and then cure it.
And if you wish, cauterize the second one as was previously mentioned in this chapter.
But a wart is a small, rough, round protuberance on the surface of the body, and many are seen in children's hands.
And its cure is that you stretch and cut it, or constrict it with a thread or hair that fits inside. And if you wish, cauterize it, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine.
But a mole is a small, velvety or large, thick protuberance on the surface of the body, often found on the face, and when the cold encounters it, it feels like a mosquito bite, and it is formed around the body.
And its cure is to take a quill from the wing of a crow or a vulture's feather, and make it strong, and place it over the mole until the circle of the quill surrounds its edges; then turn your hand with the quill until you cut that which is around the mole, and press it into the flesh of the face, and remove the mole from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a bronze or iron needle according to this form:
And the part above the needle should be subtle and blunt (as it is not perforated), wrapped in such a way that the feeling on the said area is diminished and its rotation is reduced.
And if you wish, cauterize the ant according to what was previously stated in the chapter on cautery for athlete's foot.
Concerning the shape of the instruments used to give assistance.
Sometimes assistance is given with silver, brass, or cast/hammered bronze instruments; and sometimes these instruments are made small or large according to those for whom they are intended. For example, the instrument used in the care of small children should be small, and the instruments used on patients with thin or painful buttocks should also be small.
The shape of a large and few instruments:
The tip of the needle should be wide like this, and there should be a distinction where the bag is tied, as you see here.
And the end that goes into the rectum should be blunt (not open), thin and smooth; and on one side of the shaft there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays, a little thicker.
And let there be a bag in which are placed the medicines of bladder of animal or wool of sheep, and its size should be one palm.
And it should be pierced by three holes in this way as it is rolled; and if the space that is between the holes is the size of a finger.
And then insert in those holes a strong needle, which is of three needles or enclosed by them, and fasten it to the bag; and when the bag is placed on it, it should be tightened at the top of the cross between two distinct marks with a strong string, and then seal each hole: But the way to seal it is that you fill the bag with the medicine, which should be heated according to the patient's tolerance level; and be careful that it is not too hot or too cold.
Then the patient should be laid on their back, and lift their legs up high, and place under them a pillow on which one usually lies or a cushion; and then anoint the tip of the cautery with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage or something similar; and then gently insert it into the rectum, and then the assistant should take the bag and squeeze it with two hands and forcefully press until everything in the cross is evacuated into the intestine; and then remove the cross and let the patient raise their legs to the wall.
And if medicine causes the patient to vomit, hold them as long as needed; and if they sleep with you all night, it is more beneficial for healing.
And if you treat the patient for abdominal pain and vomiting, then you should continue using the cautery until they are healed.
And if in the anus there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses, then let it be treated with a very thin and delicate cautery, like those used to treat infants.
About the treatment of wounds.
I have already said in the division of wound treatment what is suitable for this book, and now I will explain how to treat them with both hands and medicines according to their nature.
Therefore, I say that wounds are classified according to how they were made and the location on which they fell.
And the causes for which many times wounds are made are similar to being hit by a stone, or cut by a sword or knife, or struck by a spear, staff, arrow, or something similar to these many causes.
But the wounds that are in specific locations on the body are such as a wound that falls on the head, neck, foot, abdomen, chest, and similar to those of the limbs.
And I am recommending the treatment of certain ailments, so that you can apply this reasoning and rule to other ailments as well.
And I will begin with the simple head ailments, for the memory of the compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore, I say that when a simple head injury occurs and it is not a fracture, consider: if it is due to the impact of a stone or similar object, and only the membrane has been broken, causing a severe injury, and you fear an abscess forming on the patient, then you should cautiously perform trepanation quickly and without delay; and extract as much blood from him according to his strength, unless some other factor prohibits trepanation, especially if little blood has come out of the wound.
And let the trepanation be on the opposite side of the injured area; and watch the patient for signs of vomiting, dizziness, and heavy food intake.
But if any cause prevents trepanation due to the patient's weakness, then reduce his food intake and do not approach meat or wine.
And place on the wound, if an abscess forms, cotton infused in warmed oil or wine that has been boiled down.
If you're certain that it's an abscess, then place something on the wound. If it's recent, use its own blood and prevent the powder which I will mention shortly from changing due to air.
And if the air has already changed it, then place some ointments on it until it is healed.
However, if the wound is large or appears to be gaping due to lack of skin and likeness, and its lips are not close enough for stitches, then you should close them with a suture as I will describe later regarding the suturing method.
But if the wound has already exposed bone and marrow, and there is no retention of it except for a small ligament, then cut that away and subsequently treat the wound with medicines and restore the flesh in its place, and command the patient to be fed with foods in which are fats: heads and marrow, and similar things, until it is healed.
And if you find putrefaction in the flesh and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away all that is rotten and remove it, and then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood may flow, and it has not been cut by medicines, then you should look for the artery, and if you find that it is not cut, then cut it with a scalpel, or tie it off; and if necessity compels you to do what we have said does not work, then you should cauterize until the blood is stopped.
And if these plagues are simple and small, then the cause is light; thus you should powder over them this powder, for when it solidifies before the air changes them.
And the manner of making the powder is this: take one part of sesame oil, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unslaked lime; all must be ground and sieved well, and with it fill the wound, and constrain it tightly until it adheres to it well and coagulates with the blood.
And then bandage it firmly with cloths and leave it, and do not uncover it until it is healed, for the medicine will not be taken away from it until it is cured.
And sometimes this alone is enough when you do not have sesame oil and dragon's blood on hand.
And perform this same operation on large wounds when it is necessary to place them over the wounds and bind them tightly, and recent wounds with their blood that the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, and especially in summer, then it is not advisable to use this powder. Instead, cure them with the water-based ointment we mentioned earlier, or cover them with a poultice of flour made from barley mixed with water and honey until they suppurate; and then continue to treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
If a wound with bone fracture occurs and it is small, then you should extract it with forceps.
And I will tell the cure for skull fractures, which are as follows:
Of neck wounds.
However, if the wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment compared to a simple head wound.
But if the nerves of the neck are cut or an artery is severed, then if it is a nerve, there is not much hope for recovery; rather, its cure should be avoided with something that causes strong astringency, such as ziniar and zegi, which are vitriol and similar to them because they harm the nerves and constrict them. And do not place anything on the wound that is entirely cold, because the substance of the nerves is cold and its continuation is with the brain, which is the most important of all members.
And if it is to be treated with light medicines, such as being washed with sweet water, sometimes infused with rose or non-rose oil, and touched when washed with sweet water and the other stones applied in this manner, and moistened ointments.
It seems like you've provided a partial sentence. However, based on the pattern and context from the previous sentences, here is an attempt to translate the given sentence:
Based on the provided context and similarities to Romance languages, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
But if in the wound an artery has already been cut and there is a flow of blood, then separate or dry that part, or tie it off, or cauterize it if necessary to stop the bleeding.
But if the windpipe has already been cut completely or in part and the veins of the neck are saved, then close the lips of the windpipe with a suture on the surface of the throat, and do not touch it; beforehand, equalize it and restore it to its natural shape, and strengthen it with a decent stricture, and leave it alone for some days; then treat it with ointments that have hemostatic and stimulating properties until it is healed.
But if the wound has already extended into the bone, then perforate it. And if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all that you can; and what is not apparent to you, leave it until the wound heals, separates, and the soreness subsides.
And if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle over it the powder that has been recommended to you. But if in the wound a fistula (i.e., an abnormal passage or opening) has been made, then treat it with water whose mention will come up shortly in its own chapter.
If it is a piercing by a spear or knife, and you check its depth, then consider more if there is ventosity from the wound when the patient exhales; then you know that the wound is mortal.
And if there is no depth to the wound and it is recent with its own blood, then you should apply powder on it in the first hour, and not constrict it so that the blood is not retained in its depth and does not return to the heart and makes the patient worse, but rather apply an attractive ointment, and change it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not at hand, then you should place in the opening of the wound a piece of old cloth to absorb moisture from the humors; and make sure the patient sleeps on the wound so that the moisture is drained away.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound occurred and the patient does not experience spasms, heart tremors, or difficulty breathing, and other good dispositions are present, then you know that the wound is safe; and therefore treat it with poultices and other care until it is healed.
"But if his healing is delayed and the opening remains all the time, then know that a fistula has already formed; cure it according to its nature.
"And if the wound is from a cut with a knife or sword and is simple on the surface of the foot or back, then cure it with water that has been used for washing before stitching, if it's large, or with powder, if it's small.
"But if the cut has already reached the bone and there are pieces of bone coming out, then you should turn the wound and try to extract those pieces, if they are separate. "But if they are not separate, then leave them inside so that the wound can heal, which will make their removal easier.
"And for other wounds that occur in other parts of the body, the treatment is the same as we have said.
"Of the wounds of the belly.
"The disorder that occurs in the belly is either great, or small, or medium-sized.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the provided sentence:
And thus the best approach is gentle, because in this way it's not difficult to reduce the intestine, unlike the two previously mentioned methods.
And know that stitching the abdomen is done in four ways, but two of these stitches are common and suitable for stitching other parts of the body as well.
And two other specific stitches are used for other wounds, but they are especially suitable for abdominal stitching.
And I will explain to you each one in detail and clearly.
So I say that when the wound is small and some of the intestine has come out through it, and it's difficult to push it back in, this happens in one of two ways: either because of the smallness of the opening as we have said, or when the intestine has swollen due to the cold air.
And so when this is the case, you should scrape it in such a way that you immerse a sponge or cloth in warm water alone, or boil it with vinegar, cumin, thyme, and cloves, until the swelling has subsided.
"And sometimes this is done in cases where there is constipation, and it is better than water alone for the resolution of swelling.
"And thus when you see the swelling has been resolved, then you wet the intestine with water in which althea and mallow are soaked, because by this means it is relieved with little discomfort.
"But if the intestine of the patient cannot be exposed, then make a small incision with an instrument used for cutting hemorrhoids.
"And the primary treatment is better when it is performed without incision, avoiding the need and weakness that comes with cutting.
Regarding the instrument, see its shape.
"One part of it is twisted and pointed, the other part is not pointed, and its tip is sharp but not as sharp as a spatula, rather it should be somewhat blunt.
"And thus when the wound has been opened and the intestine is exposed, it should be returned to its natural shape and proper place, if possible, over water, because that is best.
"But when the incision is large and is in the lower part of the abdomen, then you should make the patient lie on their back and raise their legs above their head; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then place the head and feet of the patient higher than the rest.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your intention and consideration always on this so that the part in which the wound is will be higher than the other.
And thus it is necessary for you to administer this for both large and small wounds.
And in the small wounds, place what you have prepared on them, and then have someone who is skilled between your hands, who will hold the entire wound with his hand and adjust its lips, and then uncover that which needs to be sewn for some other cause.
And this is the common method of suturing: take the needle or count the needles according to the width of the wound; then let it go from the tip of the ring finger, and strengthen the needle in one place, ensuring that you do not put thread on both ends of the thread, with two ends of the silk that is under the thread of the parts inside, until you make that penetrate that part; and having added two ends of the thread and two ends of the silk, thus making four stitches.
And then strengthen with double thread around the needle's circumference, and sometimes even from two parts together, and then approximate the two lips of the wound by decent approximation; and then let go of the thickness of the finger and place another needle there, and then tie that one with thread just as you did with the first needle; and do not stop doing this if necessary with the needles until you have completed all the constriction of the wound.
And let the needles be moderate between coarseness and delicateness, for delicate needles cut the flesh very lightly; and coarse ones are difficult to insert into the vein, and therefore it is necessary that they are moderate in both delicateness and coarseness.
And it is not necessary that the needle be placed at both ends of the vein nearby much, lest the flesh be cut lightly and the wound break before its consolidation.
And do not prolong the stitches so that the wound is not prevented from healing.
And then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not hurt the patient during sleep; and you will place on the suture soft padding from all sides, which should cover the ends of the needles; and leave those until you know that the wound has already healed.
"And these types of stitches with needles are most suitable for small wounds, because in their stitching one or two needles are used, or around that number.
"But the second type of stitch is common: it is done by bringing together the four extremities at once - two ends of the thread and two of the suture - with a needle whose thread is equally fine and thick.
"And then, after the needle has penetrated these four extremities, return the needle from that same point where it began, so that the thread can be pulled out from the higher part of the wound, ensuring that the stitch is like a stitch used to strengthen fabric.
"And place between each stitch the thickness of the little finger.
"And this stitch is known to men.
"And with this stitch, I sewed the wound that a man had in his belly, which he had been cut by a sword, and the opening of the wound was more than a palm, and it was about two palms from the middle part of the intestine and it was located in the middle of the member; and so I reduced what protruded after the intestine had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
And the wound was healed in the space of fifteen days or thereabouts, and he was cared for and healed; and then he lived for many years, and returned to his usual activities.
And the other physicians had judged that he would not be healed; and by miracle it happened, for I did not cure him with ointment, because it was in a place where no ointment or any medicine could be found, but I placed a cloth on the wound twice a day and washed it continuously with honey water until he was healed.
But I will describe two types of stitches, according to the account of Paulus.
And it is that you begin with the stitch called "codena," and insert the needle from outside to inside.
And thus, when the needle penetrates in the "codena" and enters that knot straight and along the entire length of the body, it leaves the end of the thread on which you have inserted the needle; then make the needle penetrate from inside to outside on the other end of the stitch.  (In other words: To perform a running stitch, insert the needle from outside to inside at one end of the wound, pull the thread through and leave the end sticking out. Then insert the needle from inside to outside at the other end of the wound, pulling the thread through again.)
Certainly! Let's break down the text into manageable parts and translate it line by line:
And make the penetration with that, your penetration tool, which you use to penetrate into the hip joint at its extreme edge, located in the inner part of the patient's thigh until it all penetrates.
And then begin from this same side and pass it with the extremity that is of the hip joint to the other side, and extract the needle from the cord which penetrated, and then return that in that cord and place the extremity of the hip joint that is on the other side at this extremity of the patient; and extract that from the cord which is on the part of him.
And do this once and then again, and do it one time after another time until you have extracted everything that is outside according to that example.
And the summary of this method of suturing is that you should sew with a subcutaneous suture, with which you sew the skin, so that you sew the hip joint once from the side of the cord's extremity, and leave it the other time until you have completed it.
But the second type of proper suture, which they call Gualia, and this is said about it and recommended by him, is that you sew it with half-thread stitches with which some doctors sew, so that they bring together all the divided parts to their corresponding part according to nature; and apply the extremity of one to the extremity of the other of the patient, and this is done as I recommend to you.
Here's the translation of your sentence:
And then return each of those, and make each one penetrate from the inner part to the outer part in two extremities of the mentioned organs, except for those that are in the opposite side.
And this manner of stitching is better than common light stitching, and it is the stitching of which the preceding reminder is given.
This is the treatise of Gaul
And some may say that stitching the belly is done with two needles, so that you insert a thread into each of these needles, and begin by inserting the needle on the side where you must start, and make it penetrate to the other side according to the stitching method used for those who have had their hearts cut equally.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then its stitching is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
But the judgment of treating a wound is the same as for other wounds.
Which cause is that when you obtain the fresh wound with its blood before the air alters it, and return the intestine and close it, and prepare it properly, then place over it a powder that promotes healing.
And if the air has already altered the wound, then place on that wound ointments which are at your disposal until they form hard skin and seal the edges, and are consolidated and cured; and then treat it in the same way as you would with other wounds until it is healed.
But if you do not have the ointments available, then apply immediately, as it begins to bleed, a clean cloth, and change that cloth two times a day, just as you have been taught, until it is healed, because you will not need any other treatment for simple wounds in most cases.
But if you fear that the wound may spread to the major limbs, then it is necessary for you to immerse wool in oil of good quality or in refined oil, and place that around the edges of the wound and under the armpits.
And if there is pain or putrefaction in the intestines, because this often happens, then cauterize that with black henbane juice, especially if the putrefaction has penetrated into the cavity of the intestine and formed a deep wound.
And know that the one which is of the large intestine is of easier healing than that which is in the thin intestines.
And it is of difficult healing because the intestine which is called "jejunum" does not heal from any wound that falls upon it; and this is due to the great number of veins in it and the size of those veins, and the subtlety of its body, and its proximity to the nature of nerves.
But if that which comes from the wound is cloth and you are able to get hold of it recently, reduce it according to your judgment with which you also reduce the intestines in the same way.
But if it has passed into the space and has already turned green or black, then you should strengthen it with oil on the spot that is discolored by it, so that blood flow comes out, for in the cloth there are veins and arteries.
And immediately cut out what is the other side of that bandage, and place two ends of the oil dangling from both sides of the wound, so that the attraction to you is relieved and the fall of the cloth and emission of the arm of the wound are prevented.
"Remembering the pains that occur in the intestine.
When a disruption occurs in the intestine and it is small, it may be possible to restore it in some men, as I saw one who had been wounded in his stomach with the blow of a lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound had become old and made a fistula, and thus from him there was an issue and gas.
Then I began to heal him since he was not cured in his healing, but rather continued to refine the inside until it was healed and the place was consolidated.
And I, seeing the place was already consolidated, advised the patient to guard against any bad accident in his stomach; and none of them happened due to this bad accident, and he remained in good condition eating and drinking, and then entered a bath and was trained in these words.
And some experienced ones said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be tied in this manner: and it is that you take large-headed ants; and then adjust the two lips of the wound and place one of these ants with its mouth open over the two lips of the wound; so that when it takes hold of those and closes its mouth, cut off its head, because it adheres and does not dissolve.
And then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing this with ants, placing one after another according to the size of the entire wound.
And then reduce that and close the wound; and let those attached heads remain in the intestine until the intestine is healed; and do not cause any harm to the patient.
And it is possible to tie the intestine with thin thread made from an attached animal's intestine, since it is more like a needle; and you should take the end of these intestinal threads, which should be very thin, and then tie the end to the thread of silk, wrapped around it, and then insert that thread through needles and sew with it, closing the intestine in the rupture.
And this method of stitching with ants is not without trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, for then it is only a cauterization and not a complete healing.
On the cure of ulcers and fistulas.
Know that every wound and abscess, when it becomes old and chronic, and turns into an ulcer, and is not consolidated or healed completely, but persists over time without being opened, in whatever member it may be, it is generally called a fistula, and we call it azukem.
Certainly! Here's the translation of the first source sentence:
"And in some men it is moist, which causes swelling; and quickly after, the moisture evaporates within a few hours. "And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and scarce, and thick, and subtle.
"I have already shown all those causes and the signs of them, as well as their treatment with medicines in the division.
And it is necessary that I teach you the treatment for a fistula, which is created through surgical intervention by hand.
And know that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body; for some are fistulas that pass through the large veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the bladder, or the intestines, or the bladder, or any of the ribs, or any of the vertebrae of the spine, or any of the joints composed as such as the hand and foot; and some of these are located near the main member and resemble it.
Therefore, the fistula of this kind is among the most difficult illnesses to heal, and it does not receive treatment, and dealing with it requires work and ignorance.
And if there is any fistula whose depth does not reach these places that have been mentioned, and you hope and wish for its treatment, and you want to gain knowledge of it, then take a probe of iron or lead, and if the fistula goes straight, explore it with it.
But if the fistula is twisted, then investigate it with a fine lead probe, for lead, due to its lightness, is easily bent and follows the twisting.
"And if the fistula has horrible words, it is not within your power to interpret for him.
"Then irrigate the orifices with an irrigation solution, because the moisture used for the irrigation will go to the other orifices and flow from them.
"Then inquire carefully, in whatever way is possible for you to know if there are bones or nerves here, and whether the cavity of the fistula is distant or near, or if it is a fistula with multiple orifices and this one is entirely under your skill, with your questioning, and the questions you ask the patient about the pain, and your pressing with your hand on the area, and similar to the meanings and accidental causes of the abscess.
"And when you have stood firm on all these causes with true understanding, then proceed to the treatment with confidence: and that is for you to consider whether it is an apparent fistula near or in a prominent place, distant from a joint, or of nerves, or of artery, or of vein, or of one of the places which I have told you.
"Then you dry the fistula according to what was said before about its treatment, and remove whatever is in that opening of rotten flesh, and anything born in the orifices of the flesh, or of membranes and similar things, and cure it until it is healed.
Here's the translation for the provided text:
And do this with some vinegar until the sharp medicine dissolves everything that is soft in the cavity of the fistula of corruption.
And then restore it with ointments that promote healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it does not heal from this, then you must cauterize it as we have recommended.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain of it, then you should inquire into this and dry it out as we have recommended, unless there is any cause related to a vein or nerve or main member as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed and there is any corruption or blackness on it, then you should scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then cure it with water that promotes flesh growth until it is healed.
And if it does not heal and continues to suppurate as before, then you should know that you have not completely removed all the corruption; therefore, you should carefully uncover it again and diligently scrape and cleanse it with the strongest vinegar you have, and then restore it.
And so if it is healed, it is good; and if not, then know that this corruption is in the deep recesses of the body, which has not been reached, and thus to you in that place there is no skill but to leave it alone.
And if the bone is slightly corrupted, and if it is within your power to remove it, then you should do so using delicate forceps suitable for this purpose.
And if there are many bones, then skillfully extract all of them, and leave none unaddressed with your strength.
But if you encounter any difficulty due to the moisture, and there is no fear or error in making an incision into them, then make an incision into those ligaments or flesh if they are here, and deliver the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at that moment, then place something over the wound that will soften it, and leave it until the flesh and ligaments around those bones have relaxed. Guard the wound so that it does not heal, and keep the section that you made in your operation constricted.
Hence, if you are afraid, place a cotton cloth soaked in oil or a cotton cloth soaked in Egyptian salve, or one of the other powerful ointments, for when those ligaments have softened and the bones are separated from them, extraction is easier.
This appears to be discussing the treatment of an infected bone or similar part where only the surface is affected. Let's break it down:
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And I recommend that you consider this as an example and aid for your operation.
A young man around 30 years of age experienced pain in his abdomen, and from the internal parts, a swelling occurred in the middle of the body until the matter reached the abdomen. It was a case of an abscess with a large abscess, and there was no external cause for it.
And so the time was extended with that due to the error of the physicians until the abscess burst, and matter flowed from it. His treatment was then stopped until his thigh was fistulated, and in him were made many orifices through which all the pus and humors of the body flowed out.
And then a multitude of physicians treated him for two years, and none among them knew more about the art than I did, until I was called upon.
And I saw his thigh and the matter flowing from it through those orifices, covering a large part of the body; and the body of that man was already completely emaciated, and his color was yellowish.
And then I inserted a probe into one of those orifices and the probe reached the bone.
"And then I thoroughly examined all the orifices and found that they originated from every part of the thigh.
"And then I cut and incised into one of the orifices that I discovered, finding a piece of bone, which was rotten and decayed; and already a part of the thigh inside where it had penetrated to the marrow was also corrupt.
"And then I sawed away what had been discovered and prepared from the exposed bone.
"And I thought that it was not in the bone itself but rather the corruption which I had cut away and sawed off, and already I had scraped it clean.
"And then I applied healing ointments to the wound for a long time, but it did not heal.
"And then I scraped and discovered on the bone further, following the initial discovery, and found continuous corruption within the bone.
"And I sawed away what appeared to me from that corruption, and then I was determined to make a cure for him and restore him, but he did not recover.
"And then I opened him up again and did not cease to cut away at the bone piece by piece, determined to restore him, but he did not recover until I had incised around a palm's width of him, from which I extracted his marrow, and then I restored that with medicines, and it healed slightly and became sound.
And it is not necessary to repeat the operation on him or perform an incision except due to the condition of his weakness and lack of tolerance for it, because he is afraid of death, as he is always in danger of sudden, severe fainting episodes.
Therefore, he is healed by complete healing, and nothing remains in the place of hard flesh; and the disposition of his body is made good, and his strength returns to him; and he is returned to his usual habits, not suffering any opposition during movement or any harm for any reason.
But if there is bone protruding in the place of the previously treated body part, then you should cut it in this manner: and that is to take a ligament and tightly bind it at the tip of the protruding bone; and command someone to stretch it out; and place the thicker woolen ligament over the remaining soft tissue; and then tie it onto the flesh beneath the bone, stretching the extremity so that you pull the skin towards the split areas, and expose the flesh in the location where you want to saw, so that the saw does not cut the flesh.
And place a stick or board under the bone properly, because when you do this, it is not allowed for the saw to cut the rotten flesh.
And it is necessary that the tourniquet be placed little by little on the affected area, because if it is in the concavity of the bone and does not appear in its appearance to the touch, then force another turn of the tourniquet.
And if the bone is not protruding and it seems that one part is continuous with another, and the corruption is in the middle or at a junction of them, then you should uncover the flesh from all parts completely; and then place a stick underneath, and then tighten that [tourniquet] from the first part until the corruption is contained within the tourniquet of the other part.
And let the tourniquet be a little according to the location of the corruption, as we have said.
And if the corruption is at a joint, cut that corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it is continuous with the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuity of two joints, then it is not reasonable but harmful.
And if the corruption is in the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot, it is very difficult; however, you should seek out how the corruption appears to you, and you should scrape it off, and cleanse it according to whatever method is possible for you, and with each instrument correct what needs correction as long as it does not hinder a vein or nerve.
And you should know which are the saws and knives to cut these bones, according to the position of the bones, their preparation, thickness, subtlety, size, hardness, and rarity. Therefore, it is necessary for you to prepare all kinds of instruments suitable for that operation.
And know that this operation requires from you the type of instrument you need; for you have great study, long experience, and knowledge in the ways of this art, and you are a witness to many diseases. Therefore, you already know what is suitable for each patient's instruments for every disease.
And I will present to you at the end of this chapter the list of instruments that you should use as essentials, with which you will proceed with your practice, which you will test on other patients. Type of saw:
Another type of saw:
Shape of another large saw:
Type of file: Its head is shaped like the head of a star-shaped key, and its teeth are sharp like awl points.
And it is not recommended that only with water are the heads of the joints rubbed when they are corrupt or the opening is very wide.
A form of smaller razor.
A flat razor blade.
Another well-made saw form: it should be made in the shape of an arch and have a blade of sharp iron, with handle parts decently made from wood. Shape of it:
A curved razor blade shape.
Another subtle razor blade shape.
Another form of a curved razor tip.
A small razor resembling a tentacle.
Another smaller form of an incisor.
The form of another incisor; this one resembles a ray, and its tip is like a saw, and it is used in many places in the bone.
The form of a ray that is suitable for cutting through bones.
And its tip is triangular and sharp.
And it is made of Indian iron, and it should be noted that all the reasons we have mentioned for razors, incisors, and saws apply to this as well.
From the extremities and from the locking of the bones.
The extremities may become worse due to internal or external causes. If you have treated that corruption with those medicines and the treatment does not succeed, sometimes the corruption goes away from the member without striking any cause, then it is necessary for you to incise that member until you reach where the corruption is, so that the patient escapes through this from death or a worse evil than the loss of the member.
And the sign of this happening is that the member turns black until it seems to you as if fire has burned it, or the blackness may worsen until the putrefaction reaches into that member and takes over the whole body; therefore beware with incision in that case.
Similarly, if the corruption is caused by the bite of some poisonous creatures such as a sea scorpion, viper, or basilisk, etc.
And if the corruption or bite is on the tip of the finger, then you should incise the finger and not give space to the corruption so that it does not enter the hand.
And similarly, if you approach the hand, then incise it from the base of the thumb, and do not leave any space for corruption until it is taken in the bracelet of the arm.
And if you approach that part, then incise the arm to the elbow at the joint.
And if the corruption passes and it reaches the elbow, then in that case it is the death of the patient; and to administer any other remedy for this condition is a matter of virtue.
And similarly, with the foot, when corruption reaches the sole of the foot, then incise it up to one of the toes.
And if it reaches the arch of the foot, then incise the entire foot. But if it goes up to the shin, then incise the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already spread over the shin, then in that case there is nothing to do but to abandon the patient to his death.
And the manner of incising or sawing a member is as follows: you must tighten a ligature above the place where you want to incise, and put another ligature on the spot; and the assistant extends a ligature below the part, and the assistant also extends another ligature above; and you separate the flesh which is between two ligatures with a linen thread until all the flesh is exposed; and then it should be incised or sawed.
And it is necessary that a cloth be placed over him from all parts so that the healthy place does not touch, and a tight bandage with a healing wound comes to the patient.
But if bleeding occurs while you work, then carefully cauterize the area or place some powder on it to restrain the blood flow; and then return to your treatment until it is complete.
And then bind the afflicted limb with a bandage in a suitable manner, and care for it until it is healed.
And I recommend to you that which happened to a man in his foot, this accident which I and you have just spoken about, which is that he experienced darkness in his foot with a burning that was similar to the burning of fire.
And this corruption first happened in his toe before spreading throughout his entire foot.
And then that man prepared for himself a pus which he applied to the limb with great vehemence because of the pain and burning, and he cut off that foot up to the joint, and it was healed.
For a long time this same corruption happened in his right hand's thumb.
And then he came to me, and I tried to draw out that excess moisture with water that I poured over his hand from the medicines of the body; but the excess was not drawn out and began to spread to the other fingers in the hand.
E el apelec me a inscidir la ma de lu,
Certainly! Here is the translation of the given sentence:
And I have not added this narrative except to serve as a guide on what is to be done about this illness, and it should be a sign by which it can be identified and according to which it should be treated.
The care of sinews and the method of cleansing with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in any of the fleshy members and the space of the abscess is prolonged to the point that it collects pus, and then it breaks open and is perforated, and the pus exits from it, and the place remains hollow as if it were a vessel, and the skin above it is thin like a fine cloth, and it has not yet reached final corruption, and it does not press upon the bone or nerve or ligament, it is called a sinew, and not a fistula.
However, if the space is prolonged to the point that corruption presses upon any member, then it is called a fistula and not an ulcer.
And the care of it is that you cut out all that skin as if it were rolled up, especially when it is thin and made like a cloth, and make sure that it does not adhere to the place due to its corruption.
"But if you expect that the intestine will adhere and that corruption has not been achieved through subsequent consequence, and there is a rupture in the intestine, then you cure this with an enema.
"And if you consider the armpit, and if it is large and the arm has an unpleasant odor, then administer an enema to this area with Egyptian medicine, which is made of oil, vinegar, and honey in equal parts, mixed in a vessel, and heated over the fire until the mixture becomes thick like honey.
"Then take from him the necessary amount of water and dissolve it with honey and water; and administer an enema to the armpit with that, strengthening his anus, and allow the medicine to remain in him for the duration of two hours.
"Then expel that with force; and do this for as many days as necessary until the armpit is cleansed and the odor is eliminated.
"And sometimes it is administered with ash water, when this medicine is not available to you; and it is that you take the ash of vines, and put water on it; and then strain it and administer an enema with it until you are sure that the armpit has healed.
And if the patient does not tolerate Egyptian medicine or ash water, then enema them with water and honey, and let it be mixed with a little bit of cinnamon powder, and enema them again with wine and honey mixed together. For by the property of honey, it cleanses and washes, and the wine makes the intestines adhere; especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and are certain that the intestine has been removed, then enema them with water that makes the flesh come out in them.
And take some of the ointment of diaphoretics and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or enema them with some medicines and other ointments that have the properties which I have already written about in the treatise on ointments.
And if the orifice of the intestine is narrow and does not receive the canula of the enema, then you should dilate it gradually with a small iron, and place in it a clove wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilic ointment until it is sufficiently dilated.
Similarly, if the orifice is wide, then you should approximate its lips with a stitch and leave as much of it as necessary for the enema to enter without difficulty.
And if the opening of the body from which the arm extends upwards is raised to the higher parts, then dry it in the best place possible for the arm to go inside, because when the arm is restricted by its thinness, the skin on it will be stretched.
And if it is not possible to dry the opening inside as much as you want, then prepare the member with a preparation that will allow the arm to pass through lightly and without any obstacle.
But that which is on the orifice of the sinus, you should constantly push it back, in order to prevent something from becoming stuck inside the arm. And so that you may know if what is running out of the arm is much or little, or if it is digested or undigested.
And thus you should also consider the location of that sinus, whether the patient feels pain there or not, and if there is an abscess in it.
And when your treatment is prolonged in this manner, and you see the matter that has been applied to the orifice of the sinus is already adhering, or is about to adhere, then on the second or third day, you should unbind it, and when you unbind the wound, change the cloth for another and renew the ointment.
But if from the sinus there comes out a thin substance, do not despair of its adhesion, for healing is approaching, because some men have slow flesh generation in their wounds, and others have the opposite.
And if from the sinus many days have passed and undigested arm material has exited, then know that the sinus is not adhering; and if the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and the cause is prolonged, then you should rely on the drying of the medicines. If the medicines are moist in their substance and in their power, they become dry like diaphonicon ointment when an excessive amount of egg has been added to it.
Based on the pattern of the previous translation, let's break down this sentence:
Sure, here is my attempt at translating the text into English:
And sometimes it is administered with a long and reasoned purgative of celestial lilies (and they are celestial lilies) and oat flour, centaury, and other such simple remedies. After preparing them, sift and powder them over the honey which has been prepared; and use it.
And if the sinus is prolonged and not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in his breath, and it has already spread to the bones or other hard members or ligaments; then you should treat him with a fistula cure, as mentioned above.
Of the treatment for panaris and ingrown nails, and additional cutting of fingers and sections.
Panaris is an abscess that arises under the nail of a finger or toe, and it appears rather quickly in other fingers as well. When it becomes prolonged and its treatment is less valued, or it becomes corrupted, it releases pus into the base of the nail, which soon corrupts the entire nail, and then its corruption reaches the bone, causing a foul odor, and the end of the finger becomes swollen, and its color turns black.
And thus, when you have the water that we mentioned in the division and do not perform your treatment with it, then it is necessary for you to cut off all the remaining superfluous flesh from the nail and then cauterize the wound immediately, because cautery is very beneficial in this case.
But if the bone is healthy and the nail has been removed, and the edges of the nail begin to compress the flesh into the depths and start to pierce it, then it is necessary for you to place a thin sheet under the edge of the nail that is piercing the flesh, push it up, cut the flesh with ease, and place on it the remaining flesh some corrosive burning medicines until everything is removed; and then heal it with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already entered the bone, then it is necessary for you to cut out that bone and extract it, because the time when the bone is corrupt will never heal.
And if you see the rot and corruption going into the finger, then cut it off at one of the joints according to the prescribed memory, and then heal it until it is healed.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the provided text:
"However, this condition, which is born in the hands of certain men, is very light and fleshy throughout, and it is also very light in their bones or very light in their fingernails.
"And some of them are born at the base of the joint, or it is the native condition of certain people mentioned earlier. "However, that which is born in some fingers does not hurt, but this which is born in the joints is very light and painful.
"And of those that are fleshy, the incision should be light, and you must insert a Latin blade into its root.
"However, the treatment of that which is born in the root of the joint is difficult; therefore, beware of its incision.
"However, in the case of that which is born in the fingers at the knuckles, you should make an incision at the beginning of its flesh with a round blade down to the bone, and then saw it off with one of those suitable saws, and then cure it until it is healed.
"However, if this condition occurs in the fingers between their visible bones due to the native constitution of a man born thus, or due to a wound scarring over or from fire burning, or for similar reasons, then it is necessary to incise that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape.
And you should place between their sheets some enfuses infused with rose oil so that they are not easily hardened, and separate or place between them a thin sheet of lead until it is consolidated as needed.
Similarly, if the same happens with consolidation in the palm of the hand, then you should dry that consolidation according to how it is prepared and suitable for the shape of the member.
Concerning incisions for varicose veins, there are various methods.
Varicose veins are swollen, large veins filled with melancholic superfluity that appear in the limbs of the body, and they most commonly occur in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers, workers, and porters.
Therefore, it is necessary to administer a purge of the body with black hellebore several times with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
However, the treatment for them with iron can be done in two ways: one is to make incisions and draw out that black blood, and the other way is to lift the vein and remove it entirely.
The section is done in this manner: first, soak the patient's leg with hot water until the thick blood, which is feculent from the leg, is dissolved. Then strengthen the patient's leg to the highest part of the thigh down to the lower part of the knee with a bandage. Next, make an incision in one, two, or three places on the vein with a wide cut, and then lift the black blood upwards from the lower part of the leg towards you, and from above downwards, until the desired amount of blood has been drawn out, which will restore the patient's health.
And then tie it up, and command him to abstain from eating black bile-producing foods.
And repeat the treatment with phlebotomy when the veins are filled and this is known to the patient.
But the elevation of them is according to this manner: you who raise the leg of the patient, if there are hairs on it, first shave it; then put the leg in a bath and soak it with hot water until it becomes red and the veins are prominent; or, if it is being exercised by strong exercise, bathe it if a bath is not present, until the member is scraped.
And then dry the ligature on the right side of the vein by puncturing it in the long part or at the end of it; or lower than that, below the ankle.
And then cut the ligature with scissors and completely strip the vein until it is felt, and it should be seen that what you see becomes black as night.
And so when you have evacuated and from the ligature you see that it is white, let it be a string.
And then place the string below so that it is raised and released from the ligature, and suspend it with a gold needle.
Here's my best attempt at translating the given sentence:
And then lift it up and cut it into the posterior section of the ankle, and then remove it and raise it until it exits through the second section, and then remove it from the section above it.
And do this until you have extracted it from the highest or most superior section of all, until it is completely out; and then cut it off.
And if you cannot extract and raise it, then insert a double-pointed needle with a strong thread, tie it off and remove it, or insert a probe underneath and move your hand around until it is expelled. And be careful not to cut it; because if it is broken, it will be difficult for you to raise that part and it may fall on the patient, causing harm.
And when you have completely expelled it, then place over the wound site wool soaked in wine and both rosemary oil and plain oil, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted with twists that it wraps around the parts, and it does not follow the straight path as we have said, then you must cut along it in all places of its twists and at the points where it wraps, and then suspend it with hooks until you lift out the entirety.
And you must be careful with your cut to ensure that you do not cut the vein and injure it, because it will be difficult for you to raise it; and exercise caution in this matter.
The shape of the wound that was cut on the body:
It is not sharp like hooks or pointed at the tip to avoid injuring the vein; it should be thick and flexible so that if it were thin, it would cut the vein due to its thinness; it should have an extra thickness just as we said.
On the extraction of the vein from the leg.
This vein originates in the thighs in hot, dry lands like those in Al-Andalus, the land of Arabs, and in the hot and dry lands of India where there is little moisture, and where neither grass nor trees grow.
And it is also generated in other parts of the body besides the thighs.
Its origin is putrefaction, which comes from the intestines like the poison of snakes and worms that generate between the intestines and the flesh in the body.
And the sign of its onset is that this vein causes a severe inflammation in the thigh, and then the area becomes swollen; and soon after, the vein begins to emerge from the site of the swelling, as if it were a root of a plant.
Certainly! Let's break down the sentence line by line and provide an English translation:
And if you notice any of his parts being separated from his body for some reason, wrap it in lead and seal it with that. And if it is prolonged, then you should cut off a part of him and wrap the rest; do not cut it from the root until it has been pushed out, because if you cut it from the root, it will draw back into the flesh and cause an abscess and putrefaction in that place and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be treated gently and removed gradually until it is completely expelled from him, and none of it remains in his body.
And from this vein, in some men it exits to the length of five palms and ten fingers, and I have heard of one that was twenty palms long.
And if it is cut during the time of its treatment, then insert the ray into its hole and pierce it with a long needle into the body until all that is in the matter is evacuated, and administer putrefaction to the place for several days with medicines; and then treat it as you would an abscess.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and comes to him with many openings, and exits from each opening as a branch.
And thus treat it as we have said in the division, and with that which has been mentioned above.
Of the treatment for worms generated under the skin, and this is called cattle sickness.
This illness is named in some places as the cattle illness because it resembles a cow's disease and consists of a worm, one or few, that is born between the skin and flesh, and travels throughout the body ascending and descending, and shows its movement from member to member until it breaks the skin and comes out.
And its origin is from the putrefaction of some humors, just as happens with worms, snakes, earthworms, and roundworms in the belly.
It is feared because of its malice, for when it goes into the body and rises to the head, and reaches the brain, then it quickly breaks through it and enters and destroys the brain, and this appears to be similar.
Therefore, when you want to treat and extract it, this is done only by following its movement and appearance as perceived, and then it is necessary that you hold tightly what is above it and what is below it with a strong ligature and constriction, and immediately dry over it and extract it.
And if the flesh is affected and you do not find it, then place a cautery with fire on the spot until it dies, and the main cause to be feared is corruption of that which corrupts the spot as we have said.
And if you see that condition approaching the eye, then strengthen the eyelid with a strong bandage, and dry it out, and remove that; and it is necessary for the patient to use purging of their body with medications that evacuate bad putrid humors, and they should avoid foods that cause putrefaction.
About cutting above pain in the nose.
This condition is called "nafir" in our land, and it is a pain that comes to certain members, and it is often transferred from one member to another.
And I have seen this as I will now tell you. I was called to tend to a sick woman in a village, and when I uncovered her arm, I saw a small swelling on the funis vein of the arm. And after it had been cut for an hour, I saw that swelling move like worms going upwards, but more slowly than if it were pus, as if it were live silver moving from place to place.
And then go away from that pain and place yourself in the muscle, and stay here for one hour.
Then run to the other body part until you reach the other arm.
Then tell me that you are turning all over the body, as I see; and I was greatly amazed at the change in him and the speed from member to member. And I had already seen this before in my visions in that manner, but I have not seen many cases where pain is transferred from one limb to another. But I did not see it with the eyes as in the woman.
And I did not think it was because of that, but rather because the woman was old, with dry bodies and exposed veins, and in her appeared to the touch that windiness transferred.
And it is necessary that this does not appear according to this retrograde treatment in those who are delicate and with moist bodies and veins covered.
And when you want to treat the patient and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to the eye as we have said, then you strengthen over that and let him lean slightly and gently on that until the constrained windiness has passed, and cauterize the spot.
Sure! Let's translate the given sentence line by line into English:
"On the removal of arrows.
"Arrows are varied according to the species, and according to the parts of the body they hit, because their variety is such that some have large points, small ones, concave ones, and blunt ones, which are solid; others have three angles, and there are those that have tongues; and there are those that have barbs.
"And the signs of danger are when an arrow strikes someone and passes through the bone and exits from the fontanel above the brain, because this causes severe headache, loss of vision, dizziness, redness in the eyes, inflammation and redness of the tongue, convulsions, confusion, vomiting of bile, and a weak voice that is difficult to understand. The wound also exudes white fluid resembling powder, and there is swelling similar to water under the skin.
E therefore if these signs appear to you, then you should abstain from the treatment and removal of the arrow, unless it is outside [the body].
And the signs of an arrow when it strikes the heart are that it is near the left nipple, and one feels with it as if it were stuck in a hard substance, not a soft one; and the movement of the arrow is similar to the pulse's movement, and black blood flows from the wound, and there is coldness in the extremities, and sweat, and fainting; and therefore you should know that death comes without warning.
And the signs when an arrow has struck the lung are foamy blood coming from the wound, and the veins near the neck are swollen, and the patient's color changes, and they exhale a great deal of breath, and they desperately seek cold air.
And if the arrow strikes the diaphragm which is in the feet [i.e., lower part of the body], then the pain is near the small ribs, and there is a great increase in pain with vehement dolor and sighing, and all the limbs are not good [i.e., weak or paralyzed].
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then it is certain that some undigested food will come out of the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly and is embedded in it, there may be some tear in the wound or tissue or intestine which has been ruptured, and there is no hope for his healing without removing the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder and causes urine to come out, and some part of it comes out due to some cause, and there is severe pain on the patient, then know that it is fatal.
But the other members, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulders and arms, ribs of the back, collarbone, hip, thigh and similar parts of the limbs, are saved according to the best dispositions if the arrow does not find a vein or artery and is not poisoned.
And I will tell you this because of my experience with these arrows, so that you may know about their treatment.
The reason is that in one man an arrow was shot into his tear duct of the eye at the root of the nose, and I extracted it from him from the other side, leaving only the hair of his ear behind, and he healed, and there was no harm to his eye.
And another arrow was extracted from a Jew, which had struck him in the gray of his eye, under the eyelid. The arrow was already hidden and only a small tip was obtained from it, to which it adhered with its shaft. It was a large arrow of the pointed arrows of the Turks, with a lion's head in which there were no aureoles.
And the Jew died, and he did not suffer from any other bad accident.
And another arrow was extracted from a Christian man, which had fallen into his throat. It was an Arabic arrow, and it was that one with the feathers; and then I made an incision over it between two veins, and it was already submerged in his throat. And then I carefully removed it, and afterwards I extracted it, and the Christian man was healed.
And another arrow was extracted from a man which had fallen into his belly, and it was thought that he would die from it; and then, after thirty days had passed and there had been no change in any of his conditions, I made an incision over the arrow and pulled it out, and he was healed, and no other bad accident happened to him.
And you see another man in whose back an arrow is lodged, and the wound has healed over it, and although seven years have passed, the arrowhead remains in the flesh.
And you see a woman in whom an arrow is lodged in her belly, and the wound has healed inside her, and she has not changed in any of her habits or activities, and the woman does not suffer any damage in any of her natural functions.
And you see another man in whom an arrow is lodged in his face, and the wound has healed, and the arrow has broken off, causing him no pain, and similar to these [other] cases.
And you extract the arrow from the man, one of the king's chief men, which was lodged in the middle of his nose and had inclined slightly towards the right side, and the entire arrow was hidden.
And I was called to treat him soon after the arrow entered [his body] within three days.
And then I found the arrow wound to be very narrow; and then I explored it with a fine probe, but did not feel [the arrow], but he felt a prick below his right ear, and then I suspected that this prick was due to the tip of the arrow.
And apply a plaster to the affected area, one that contains attractive and digestive virtues, made by me so that the place of the arrow can be detected by me, so that it can be dried over it.
And if the arrow had not reached that place; and I continued with the plaster on it for many days, and no accident occurred; and meanwhile the wound healed, and the patient was removed from extraction for some days until one day he felt the arrow in his nose and reported this to me.
And then I placed a sharp, corrosive medicine on the wound for many days until it opened up, and with the probe I searched for it, and found the tip of the subtle arrow which was attached to the shaft.
And then I adjusted in the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine until the tip of the arrow became clearly visible to me, and I spent time with it over the course of four months.
And when the wound had grown large enough for me to insert the forceps into it, and they remained there without obstruction, then I did not stop trying and devising ways to do so with various tricks until one day I began to use a set of forceps made for the purpose, as will be shown at the end of this chapter, until I extracted it; and then I healed that wound.
And some doctors judged that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored, and I have restored it and the wound has healed, and the patient is healed completely, and I did not cut anything in him for any reason.
And I will explain to you the technique of extracting certain arrows, so that you may follow this rule and meaning on what I have not said, because the foundations of this art and its definitions are not understood through narrative alone nor do they comprehend those who read books.
The wise craftsman compares the few with the many, and what is present with what is absent, and finds new operations and new tools through the understanding of foreign causes in the art when they occur.
Therefore, I say that arrows are not removed from the limbs in which they are stuck except by two methods: either by attracting the place where they enter or by the opposite of the other part.
And that which is thrown into the place where it entered, or is a projectile in a fleshy location, and is pulled out and removed.
And if it does not obey the extraction at the time of its capture, then you must leave it for some days until the flesh around it softens, and thus its removal will be easier.
And similarly, if a splinter is embedded in the bone and does not obey extraction, then leave it there for several days and repeat the procedure with attraction and moisture each day, until it is expelled.
And if it does not obey extraction, then wait several days until you can perforate around the circumference of the splinter in that bone from all directions with a fine trepan until the area is enlarged by the splinter, and then extract it.
"But if the arrow is already lodged in the body and hidden from sensation, then you will probe for it with a tentacle, and if you feel it, then remove it with suitable instruments for its extraction.
"And if you cannot reach it due to the constriction of the wound and the length of the shaft, and there are no bones, nerves or veins here, then you should make an incision in the wound until it is enlarged enough to extract the arrow.
"And if the arrow is in the ears, then you should cut away all the flesh around it with whatever means you can; and contrive on that, if you cannot remove the shaft of the arrow through the fracture of the ears and twisting them until they yield.
"And when you are performing the extraction of the arrow from any location, then use tweezers and your hand with forceps on all sides until it submits; and be careful with great care that the arrow is not broken during the difficult removal, both of it and its extraction.
"And if you cannot remove it at that time, then leave it for some days until the parts around it soften, and then attempt to remove it again when it has relaxed. If there is an opposing flow of blood, then administer what we have said about treatment in the relevant chapter.
And be careful of your virtue regarding the incision of a vein, nerve, or cord, and administer in every possible way to avoid injury from the arrow; do this with ease, calmness, slowness, and steadiness, as we have recommended to you.
And therefore do the opposite of what the arrow did to the patient, according to the figure and the way in which you must remove the arrow from him, for it is more beneficial. But if that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible according to the figures.
But arrows that are thrown from the opposite side of the other part, or if any part has already separated from its parts outside, or if the tip of the arrow is swollen by feeling more on top of the corresponding head, then cut it; and let the cut be according to the amount in which the forceps take hold; and then pull that out, because it is made easy for removal.
But if it is stuck in the bone, then twist the blade in the opposite direction until the arrow presses against the bone, and widen the hole, and then pull it out.
And if not, leave it for several days, and then repeat the process until it heals.
And if the shaft of the arrow is in it, then you extract it with that.
But if the shaft has broken off and you want to administer an impulse, then you insert that [tool], if it is blunt, into the concave instrument so that it enters the concavity of the arrowhead in the back of the arrow, and then extract it with that.
But if the arrow is barbed, then you extract it using a strong instrument entering into that [wound], because the arrow is relieved by that [instrument].
And if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you cut away all the flesh in which there is the venom, if it is possible for you to do so, and then cure it with what is appropriate.
And if the arrow strikes the foot, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side, and it is close enough that you can touch it with your finger, and it is possible to saw over it, then saw over it and beware of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it, and then close the wound if necessary, and cure it until it heals.
"Type of forceps with which arrows are drawn:
"Their tips are like the beak of a bird, made serrated when they take hold of the arrow so that it cannot escape.
"And from those are made many different types of them, large, few, and slender, according to the size of the arrow and its thinness, and the width of the wound, and the constriction thereof.
"like a ray so that its entry into the hollow arrow is facilitated and it is pushed with it.
"About bloodletting from the veins.
"The veins that are commonly used for bloodletting are xxx, of which there are sixteen in the head. There are two pulsating veins near the ears, called auriculars; two herbs on each of the two temples; and two veins in each lacrimal duct of the eyes, known as aspicientiae. There is also a vein located in the middle of the forehead, one at the tip of the nose; two jugulars at the neck; two veins above the lips; two below the lips — these are called angelic veins —; and there are two veins under the tongue. Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
Here is the translation of the provided sentence:
The treatment of the veins near the ears is for ancient headaches, migraines, head sores, and old ulcers on the head.
And the quality of bleeding those [veins] is as I advise you: that it be shaved on the patient's head, and that the patient's head be rubbed in the back of the skull where both veins are, with a wide cloth and good friction; then bind the patient's neck tightly with a bandage until both [veins] appear near their places at two prominent points on the head; and you will seek it with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those [veins] with your finger, here is the sign to attempt it.
Then take the scalpel, which is sharp, and then insert it under the vein into the tendon until the phlebotomist comes to the bone. Then raise your hand with the vein and tendon at the parted areas above, and cut the vein with a sharp incision. And let the length of the incision be the width of two fingers, or about that; and let as much blood flow out as you wish.
And then strengthen with bandages and leave it until it is healed.
And already at the beginning of this book, we have discussed these conditions and their treatment by cautery.
But the two arterial veins located in the temples, the aid of phlebotomy is for chronic and severe migraine, persistent headaches, and acute outpourings of superfluities in the eyes.
And the method of bloodletting these is as I have instructed you: hold the patient’s head firmly until the two veins can be felt clearly, and then demonstrate their pulse under your finger; at that point, you may proceed with the lancet.
Then you lift the skin above the vein with your index finger, and insert the lancet underneath, lifting the vein slightly; cut it as you did with the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to your need.
Then release the ligature from the patient, and place your finger over the vein for an hour; then cover that spot with cotton and bandages, and strengthen it with a firm constriction; leave it until it is healed.
Based on the given text and the pattern of translation you've provided, here's a line-by-line translation of the sentence:
And thus the bleeding of phlebotomy of the vein of the forehead is similar to the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for ancient ailments of the face and migraines, as well as for foul-smelling ulcers.
And the quality of this phlebotomy depends on what I have explained to you. Therefore, the patient should strengthen their neck with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument called a "fossor," which looks like this.
Place the point prominently at the top of the fossor on that vein, and strike it firmly or with another similar cause in this manner, allowing the blood to flow according to the desired amount; then release the perforation from the patient and bind it tightly until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide phlebotomy, however, it is not necessary that the phlebotomy be of an acute extremity as with other phlebotomies, but rather it should be of a broad extremity, and perform this across the transverse because the bone is nearby and strong, lest a subtle phlebotomy break on it.
But the treatment of the two veins located at the inner corners of the eyes is for scabies of the eyelids due to burning and oozing in the eyelids, as well as for ailments of the face.
And the nature of bloodletting is such that the patient should hold their neck with a bandage, and you should proceed to bleed them, while standing over their head.
And the bloodletting should be done lengthwise for a short distance with small incisions, because in this area there is no flesh; and if the incision is fine, it will easily break the extremity of it.
And then allow the blood to run as much as is necessary for you, and place a cloth over it, and bind it tightly for one night, and then unbind it.
However, bloodletting from the nose vein is suitable for acute fever and severe thirst, and for facial diseases and migraines and redness that occurs on the face, especially when it is chronic.
And the method of this bloodletting is that the patient should hold their neck and then take their nose with your left hand, and take a fine, long incision and place it in the middle of the tip of the nose lengthwise, because the vein is not felt here, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
Be careful that you end the incision little by little and allow the blood to flow according to your need; and then bind it for one night, because this area heals easily.
Certainly! Here's the line-by-line translation of the given text:
And the nature of those bloodletting procedures is such that the patient should be lying on their side with a pillow under them; and the practitioners should be positioned over the patient's head, while the patient lies on a stool.
And then perform the bloodletting by opening the vein with a small flebotomy knife gradually; and extract blood according to temperate quantity or as many times as necessary; and then do the same for the other vein.
And then loosen the bandage and bind both veins tightly to prevent the patient from being overwhelmed by blood loss, and leave it until morning when the wound has healed.
And the benefit of bloodletting from the large veins includes curing small boils and pustules in the mouth, corruption of the gums, bad ulcers, cracks, and bad ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
And the nature of those bloodletting procedures is that you should make the patient sit before you, and bind their neck with a bandage, then turn back their lips and look for two veins, one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left; and the indication of each is by its blackness, and this is because there are small black veins around them; and then incise each with an incising cut.  (This passage describes bloodletting from the labial veins)
If there is doubt about which of the two (conditions) it is, then you should proceed with an incision into the larger and more apparent of the two.
And make an incision similar to that of the two veins found on the lips above.
But of the two veins below the tongue, it is most appropriate to perform phlebotomy on the cephalic vein at the junction with the jugular, for diseases of the uvula and mouth diseases.
And the method of phlebotomizing those is to follow the patient between your hands in front of the sun, and lift their tongue, and look beneath the tongue, from one side of it you will see a vein, and on the other side another vein, and the color of each inclines towards blackness.
Then phlebotomize each one; and be careful not to slip your hand while phlebotomizing those, for below them are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are those which run customarily in all men, and their phlebotomy is done in two ways: either they use a myrtle or olive-colored lancet with a declining subtlety; or with a cutting lancet, and it is called a fleam.
It is necessary to open the veins in such a manner as many times as needed, and it is convenient to open the large and prominent convex veins, and those that contain thick and turbid blood.
And this bloodletting is of lesser intensity and more subtle, and it is suitable for bloodletting of subtle veins that contain delicate and clear blood.
However, the benefit of bloodletting from the basilic vein, which is one of three veins, is that it draws blood from illnesses located below the throat and the neck, as well as from what affects the feet and the belly.
It is necessary for the person performing the bloodletting, when doing this particular one, to be very careful and attentive, because below it there is an artery. And if he errs or strays in the puncture of the bloodletting, he will cut that artery and cause a flow of blood. Therefore, it is important not to perform this with a pointed fleam, but rather to first make an incision with a knife.
And if the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary to leave that one and move to another [vein], or look for some of its branches; or perform bloodletting in the end of the arm, because it is very visible; and do this with a knife fleam as we have said.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
When you see that by strengthening the bandage, swelling occurs in the place you have indicated with a tent, then that swelling is swelling of the artery, and therefore avoid it.
If you see the blood flowing in the phlebotomy like a child's urine, and the blood is thin red, then know that it is from the artery; and then you cut and place your finger over it for a long time; and then remove your finger, and if the blood is cut off, because many times it is cut off, then strengthen the arm and let it go.  (In other words, if you see thin red blood flowing like urine during bloodletting, it means you've hit an artery. Immediately apply pressure to stop the bleeding, and once it has stopped, reinforce the bandage and release.)
And keep the patient from moving, and be overly careful with them and do not allow that for several days until they are healed.
But if the blood does not stop and you see that you cannot present medicine to it, then you should incise the artery, if it appears to you; because its extremity is contracted, and the blood is cut off; or take a piece of linen cloth, and make a tourniquet with it, and take half of it and strengthen it over the place of the vein with tightness and bandage and pulp until the next day.
And then if the blood has been cut, that's good; and if not, then cure it with the water from which it is preceded at the memory of the place where the powder cut the flow of blood.
And the incision of his blood is difficult in many respects because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of damaging the arm.
However, the phlebotomy of the dark vein is helpful because it extracts blood from above the neck and below the body; because it is composed of branches of the basilic vein and branches of the cephalic vein, as we have said.
And it is appropriate for the phlebotomist to be overly cautious during his phlebotomy, because below it there is a nerve; and therefore if he hits the nerve with the puncture of the phlebotomy, a stupor will happen to him, and healing will be difficult for him, and rarely is he completely healed. And this nerve appears many times in the sensation; and if it is hidden in some people and is subtle and not revealed, then it is appropriate that you place the phlebotomy needle with which you perform phlebotomy with a section of alnus wood, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you cut the vein along its length.
The assistance of the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is to draw blood from the head and heal the ailments of the eyes.
And it is appropriate in this case, if you want the phlebotomist to puncture with an olive-shaped or myrtle-shaped fleam; because it is the safest of all veins, as it is not near any artery or nerve.
However, it is often the case that in some men, when the first percussion is not phlebotomized, do not notice this swelling again.
The first [thing to consider] is that you should know that phlebotomy is not administered except for the preservation of health and hope for it, and as a precaution against the onset of illnesses, and that phlebotomy should be done in one of the veins that are in the elbow, which are: cephalic, dark, and basilica; and that phlebotomy should be done at the beginning of spring, after fasting in spring and autumn, and in winter near a meal, when there are signs of repletion.
And let a phlebotomy be performed on the third day or within the first three hours of the day.
But a phlebotomy, when it is administered, should be done only when it is appropriate and necessary, whether at night or during the day, at any time and in any circumstance.
And it is not advisable to perform phlebotomy on a child until they are fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman should not be bled except between the fourth and seventh month of pregnancy, and the elderly who have reached sixty years of age should not be bled.
And if someone wishes to be bled by any means, it is advisable for them to cleanse their intestines before phlebotomy with a clyster of lion, so that the veins do not draw the impurities from the intestines, which are putrid and harmful to the main members.
And those who are suffering from seasickness or drunkenness should not be bled until these conditions have passed, nor should those suffering from illness or fever be bled until it has been removed from them. Those with dropsy should also not be bled. Moreover, phlebotomy should be feared in cases of colic and vomiting, as well as abdominal pain, excessive sexual activity, hard work, fasting, vigils, and any cause that weakens the strength, whether physical or mental.
And then consider in the refinement of humors whether the blood is thick. If so, treat with food and drink, and with medicines if necessary to reduce it.
And then enter a bath if no cause prohibits it, or exercise through some exercise so that the blood is refined.
And perform the bloodletting on him at the feet of the day, specifically around the third hour, as we have said.
And make sure that the feet of this patient are protected from all animal misfortunes on that day, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and all bodily accidents, such as work and unnecessary pain, lust, and their likeness.
And in his room, have present the causes of which customarily men use with aroma and fragrance, with balms and similar things according to the quantity of possibility.
And let the bloodletter sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one who must be bled.
And then extract his arm and rub it with his hand, the bloodletter, two or three times; and then tie the band tightly with a strap and wrap it two more times.
Sure, I'd be happy to help translate this sentence:
And before the operation, it is necessary that the one who is to be bloodletted rub his hands together until the veins are swollen and clearly discernible by touch.
And before the bloodletting, let the bloodletter anoint their incision site with a little appropriate old oil; and then place their right index finger over that vein, just below where you want to perform the bloodletting, so that the vein swells slightly and the pulsation can be felt. When you find a vein that feels like a string fleeing beneath your finger, that is one filled with windiness; when you place your incision over it, the vein should contract and become visible to the bloodletter; if the incision does not open the vein, then that vein is narrow.
Therefore, it is necessary for the bloodletter to be careful and pay attention to all these factors.
And then remove the incision, but if the vein is opened in one attempt, that is good; and if not, you should try again in another spot nearby or immediately above it, if the site is not inflamed.
And if the area is swollen or the patient is faint, then you leave it for a day or two and do not tighten the bandage, because the swelling will draw out quickly, and they should not enter into a bath.
And then proceed with bloodletting if necessary.
And if the opening is small and blood flows gently, and you fear that not enough blood will come out, then repeat the bloodletting in that vein according to what is proper and tighten the opening slightly. Do this quickly before the area becomes swollen, for in many men a small incision is necessary when the area is swollen.
But if you see that it is already swollen, then do not repeat on it, for no reason will justify it; and place on it a piece of the linen cloth used for oil, for it relieves the body of blood. And in this case, olive oil is better than other oils.
Similarly, apply a piece of linen cloth soaked in oil to every bloodletting with which you draw out the veins, and avoid prohibited foods for the body's blood, and use theriac alfadoc and sage when one of those is placed on the area, because the blood becomes thin and agitated when it is thick.
And if in the place of phlebotomy a large abscess has formed, which often happens, especially to those who have not been bled before or upon opening a small vein, then you should cut and place a sponge soaked in water and salt over the area for about an hour, as it will dissolve.
And you should do this near the end of bleeding from that vein or another vein.
And if any blackness or greenish color remains in the area for some days, do not worry; and if you wish, place over it some dissolved aloe and myrrh, or some juice of mint, camomile, or similar.
And often these abscesses and swellings require phlebotomy from the basilic vein.
And so place your hand on that area, and if you find softness, press on it, for then that swelling is bad and harmful; and in that case, be careful not to put any water-based substance on it, for blood will flow heavily from the artery.
And make an emplastrum with water that has astringent properties, so that the area becomes hardened, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
And it is necessary to extract blood from every person according to the amount of their vitality and according to the color that prevails in the blood as it appears.
Because if the blood is black, then you let it flow until it turns red; and likewise, if you see that it is thick, then you let it flow until it becomes thinner; and likewise, if it is sharp, then you let it flow until its sharpness has been removed.
And it is necessary for someone who is full and strong and has a need to extract blood all at once that the phlebotomy of the vein be enlarged and the phlebotomies be wide.
And in someone who is weak, the opposite should be done: it is necessary that they extract [blood] in many times, and that the cut be narrow.
And the best thing administered in phlebotomy of a vein is that it should be a transverse section, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood and the injury of nerves, and it is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy according to length and width.
And to those who are accustomed to fainting, you should perform phlebotomy, and it is necessary that before the phlebotomy you treat them with a little piece of bread infused in milk of millet or simple oxymel; and extract one-quarter of their blood in three or four times.
And if it is a condition of plethora (excess), then before the phlebotomy, infuse essences such as myrrh essence or honey essence flavored with spices like pepper, cinnamon, ginger and similar ones, or an aromatic and strongly scented essence.
And if a syncopal episode occurs and the cause is due to excessive blood loss, then it is necessary to drink meat water and strongly scented subtle essences; use aromatics with aloe vera, and anoint your feet with it.
And use the other causes that we mentioned in the section on syncope for evacuation.
And whoever wants to strengthen their arm and dissolve the blood according to their constitution, it is necessary for them whose phlebotomy is for great evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that they should evacuate the blood little by little, according to the quantity of strength on consecutive days.
But if one wants to strengthen their arm and get rid of the blood according to times (schedule), and their body is strong, then do this approximately seven or nine hours after the first phlebotomy.
Based on the context and the similarities to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's my best attempt at translating the sentence:
Here's my attempt at translating the given sentence into English:
And it is not necessary when you want to unbind the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, since the orifices of the vein are already closed and it has become difficult for the blood to flow out, that you press strongly on it with force, as this is too harsh.
Have the patient lie down so that they may be bloodletted properly; or leave it with the sharpness of the fleubotomi that has coagulated the blood in the vein's orifices; or place on it a little alfarach, or saffron, and press gently on it until the blood has been evacuated.
And if the vein is swollen, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the swelling has subsided.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then bleed on that same spot or on the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "funis del bras" is bled in the place of the fovea or basilica, when they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of those [places].
The quality of its bloodletting is that the patient places their hand in hot water until the fovea turns red and the vein becomes clearly visible.
And then bind it tightly over that area with a bandage and a restrictive tourniquet; and then perform phlebotomy according to the small transverse vein, not longitudinally or along the length.
And let it be an open wound, and let your phlebotomy be with that by which you make an incision on the joint of the hand a little.
And if the flow of blood is stopped, then dip your hand in hot water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your goal.
But if it is the summer days, then you are exempt from dipping your hand in hot water, and the same must be done with the corpse's blood in hot water during the winter time.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than any other vein because after it there is no pulsatile vein or nerve.
And phlebotomy of the sole of the right foot is suitable for liver diseases.
And the quality of his phlebotomy is that you bind the hand with a bandage or your hand, after you have placed it in hot water, until the vein is swollen and well shown to sight; and then make an incision on the transverse vein, and if you cut that entirely, there will be no harm.
E conserva que no utilices tu mano en la flebotomía, porque después de extraer la sangre, los nervios quedan expuestos sin piel.
And immediately dip your hand in hot water and allow the blood to flow into it, for if you do not dip it in hot water, the blood will coagulate at the opening of the vein, which is prohibited.
And when the blood has been extracted in the necessary quantity, then you should place oil and salt on the vein to prevent it from becoming hardened; and likewise, you must do this for every narrow vein.
However, the benefit of performing phlebotomy on the left hand is that it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen.
And do the same with the other phlebotomy as you have done with this one.
And the benefit of phlebotomy from the saphenous vein is for diseases that are located in the lower part of the body, such as uterine diseases and menstrual retention, as well as leg ulcers and old lesions on the thighs, and similar diseases.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And therefore, with a wide reamer or beneath the thigh, you should go to the ankle and up to its joint, because it is better and more beneficial.
And if you perform phlebotomy on the surface of the foot, then be careful not to hit the nerves that are beneath the skin on the surface of the foot. Place your phlebotomy instrument at an angle, as if you were trying to cut through it.
And make sure the phlebotomies are visible.
But if the flow of blood is inhibited, then immerse his foot in hot water and let the blood run out until it is completely drained.
And if the phlebotomist errs in the first attempt, then try again with the phlebotomy instrument a little higher up, because the area is healthy; and do not be afraid of the patient's malice, but rather be careful of the nerves as we have said.
Do the same with the saphenous vein of the other foot likewise.
And for the sciatic vein, the location is as we have said, below the ankle, on the outside of the body.
And the aid for his phlebotomy is pain in the hip when it is due to an excess of blood.
And the quality of the bloodletting for him is that the patient enters the bath, and quickly and strongly tie his calf above the ankle, with four said items in a long and subtle bandage, because it does not appear otherwise.
Therefore, when it appears, you bleed him according to each method that is within your power and ability, and it will be better; or you may incise it by incision or dry it by drying, because his place is healed.
And it is very useful in many men; and if you find that, and it does not appear to the feeling of all, then bleed some of him, and this one appears on the back of the foot opposite the said big toe and ring finger.
And beware of the nerves, and let flow as much blood as you wish.
Then release the stricture and place on the site of the bloodletting cotton and bandage the site strongly, because it will be healed lightly.
Of cupping and the qualities of using those.
Cupping can be made from horns, or glass, or crystal.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with scarification and bloodletting, and the other is cupping without scarification.
"And this venesection, which is without scarification, is done in two ways, either with fire or without fire.
"And for the venesections that are administered with scarification and extraction of blood, there are fourteen places on the body: one where the venesection is placed in the alnocrati, which is the lower part of the head; half of one between the two parts of the neck together; a venesection under the chin below the jawline; venesections of both temples; a venesection of the alohoster, which is at the end of the ribcage; venesections of the two little fingers, and these are two hands' breadths away; venesections of the two thumbs; venesections of both thighs.
"And the venesection does not extract blood except from the small veins spread throughout the flesh, and for this reason it does not capture the virtue through them, as happens with phlebotomy; nor is it necessary that the venesection be done with fire or without fire in any illness caused by repletion until the whole body has been evacuated.
"However, if necessity demands venesection for an illness or for a prophylactic measure, administer it at the beginning of the month and at its end, in the middle of the month, and whenever needed.
And therefore, when (you) see (something) in any of those cases, and especially if it is in the third or middle of the month, then (it is) ordered that cupping should be done because two or three hours have passed since the day.
And the benefit of cupping on the neck is that when you apply it to the head and it sinks into the veins, but it should be an evacuation of the entire body.
And this cupping (should be done) in the place of phlebotomy on the cephalic (vein).
And it is not fitting to use this one who has a complete cold or a fever, because it causes great harm to them.
And for this reason, the old should not use it, especially if their heads are cold with illness.
But on those who continue to use it, forgetfulness is done on them; and for this reason, you should order the person performing cupping to slightly lift their hand with the cup before leaving, fearing the development of forgetfulness.
But cupping on the back is in the place of phlebotomy of the basilic and vena fusca veins: and by doing so, you treat asthma, and constriction of breath, and tearing of the wind instrument, and coughing, and fullness (of the chest).
And it is necessary that the wound be cleaned with some alcohol, for if it is left untreated, it generates weakness in the body and in the stomach.
And the wound of alhagdahan (Algol in Latin) is effective against headaches and cataracts, migraines, fevers, and toothaches; it is used instead of bloodletting from the basilica vein.
And it is necessary to command the wound-maker not to press with his hand during the scarification, lest he cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
And the wound below the chin is effective against alcoholism in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar diseases that are in the mouth; it is used instead of bloodletting from the philtrum vein which is on both lips.
But the wound that is made on both cheeks is effective against catarrh, which is caused by an excess of heat.
And the wound made in the two depressions between the eyes is equivalent to the bloodletting of three veins: the basilica, jugular, and cephalic veins; because that attracts the blood from all the smaller veins that are in the flesh, and the smaller veins of the other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three main veins.
And command the bloodletter not to proceed too vigorously in scarification, because the area is devoid of flesh, and underneath are his nerves and arteries.
And it is a cupping glass with which one is cupped over the haemorrhoids of the anus and on the ulcerous pus underneath.
And you should command the bloodletter that it be a large cupping glass, and that it be made of bronze, because the area requires strong heat; and also let the fine and light cupping glasses be used, and have them scarified with scarification.
But cupping glasses of the thighs are to be used with manifest moderation, because they draw blood from the whole body, and thus confer benefit on old pains of the loins and back, and of the bladder; and they provoke menstruation, and thus confer benefit on gout and dropsy; and they serve in place of phlebotomy of two veins, the jugular, and of two ribs.
However, they weaken the whole body greatly and cause syncope in many men.
And the benefit of the cupping glasses on the ribs is almost the same as that of the cupping glasses on two thighs.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text: And do not stop applying [the treatment] and continue until you see the area turn red and swell, and the color of blood appears.
And then you should cauterize and continue suction little by little, and then consider the condition of the patient's body.
Because a man with delicate and sparse skin should only be cauterized once, lest the area become ulcerated.
And instruct the cupping practitioner to enlarge the cauterization and prick a little, and always suck with ease.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary to cauterize twice, because with the first cauterization, the pathway for the refinement of the blood and its wateriness is opened. But with the second [cauterization], to ensure the extraction of the thickened blood.
And if the blood is very dark, then a third cauterization should be performed to achieve the desired result.
Finally, when we want to extract a small amount of blood or just a little, one cauterization is enough for us.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we cauterize with many cauterizations; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to cauterize with deep cauterization.
And the depth of the incision is only as deep as the handle of a spoon.
And if the person whose veins are thick, hard, dark, and narrow, it is necessary that the places of the cupping glasses be treated gently, widely, and resolutely; in summertime, using oil of aloe or oil of violets, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of wild cumin; and in wintertime, oil of narcissus, or oil of lily, or oil of chamomile, or oil of hemp, and similar oils.
And if the swelling is large and inflamed, then use oil of marigold, or oil of lemon balm, or oil of aloe, or oil of aniseed, and similar oils.
But if the cupping glass user has wide and tender veins, then it is necessary that they be forbidden from oil, and it is necessary that for these people, before cupping, the areas of the cupping glasses should be washed with vinegar or with hot water from a solar oven, or with hot water of wild cumin, or with hot water of burdock, and similar waters.
And that one whose blood is of high moisture, wash his veins with vinegar, or with water of myrtle and sumac, similar to these.
And that one whose superfluous fluids are thick, wash his veins with old vinegar, or with water of savory (satureja), or of a decoction of dill, chamomile, and similar to these.
And it is necessary that the venesection be done before the bath; and it is necessary that it be administered soon after the bath for an hour or two, and it is necessary to sleep near the venesection site.
What should be taken care of before venesection in a person who has been bled?
It is necessary to consider at the beginning: if the person who needs to be bled or the one performing the venesection has a hot and inflamed blood condition, it is necessary that they take cooling remedies, such as acetous milfoil, endive with vinegar, lettuce, and syrup, and similar to these.
And let them eat their food such as polenta, and the meat of lean birds, and foods seasoned with bitter herbs, and similar to these.
It seems like the text is discussing remedies for someone with a certain condition. Let's break it down line by line:
And it is necessary that during the day of purging and bloodletting, the drink should be greater than the food.
And it is necessary to give some men triaca alpharac or musk medicine, such as musk or alcelita, before purging or bloodletting or nearby, so that the main members are comforted and the blood is subtilized; and it is not necessary for them to take that cold drink.
But the ventozas that are without scarification should be placed on the liver, and on the spleen, and on gout, and on the navel, in the locations of the kidneys, and the bladder of the gallbladder, because these members do not tolerate scarification on them.
And it is not sought from them except for the attraction of blood from a member, just as they place a ventosa on the breast in an illness of the flux of nosebleed; and they use this to dissolve the frigid viscous ventosity of the member, just as they place [it] on the stomach and navel; because it rarefies the member and cools it and removes the pain that resolves the ventosity.
And it has already been placed on the loins when they occur there in pain or abscess, because by virtue of strong attraction it lifts up pain and eradicates the abscess from its place.
And similarly when it is placed over the liver and spleen, you should close any openings therein.
And these openings should be administered with suction alone; and some are administered with fire.
And some openings are administered filled with lukewarm water in the illnesses of the spleen.
And this is why the opening should be filled and be as large as possible: it should be with hot water alone or water in which there are appropriate healing herbs.
The shape of the opening administered with fire: it should have the width of two fingers, according to how we form it; and the amount of air should be half a palm; and it should be on his side, in the area where there is a circumference, half of it, the hole should be small enough that a needle can fit into it.
It should be made of red copper or citrus, with thick edges, round and smooth, so that it does not disturb the member beneath it.
And in the middle of it there should be a crossbar of iron or iron, where a candle with fire is placed.
And this opening should be much larger than the one we described earlier; and the smaller ones according to the illnesses and condition of the person using it.
And the cupping glasses of infants and the weak are different from those of young people and large-bodied individuals.
And the quality of placing this cupping glass with fire on a member is to spread the cloth with decent firewood in front of a few candles made of wax, and place it in the middle of the transverse rod in the middle of the cup, so that the fire is lit around the bottom for fear of burning the patient's body.
And then it should be placed on the patient's member, and the mouth should be on the hole that we have mentioned, until when we have the cups and do not need them anymore, remove the mouth so that the steam escapes through that hole, then the cup will immediately dissolve.
And then ignite the cloth according to its method, and repeat this if you need more of that.
However, in the case of a cupping glass administered for pleurisy, with water, in which there is neither a transverse rod nor a hole, and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and it is placed only on the member.
And this is its form: And this cup, the larger it is, the better, because it can receive a greater quantity of water.
Chapter 97
Bloodsuckers are not administered on all members but only on those in which it is not possible to place cupping glasses due to their smallness, such as the foot and gums; or on members lacking flesh, such as the tongue and nose and similar ones.
And the way to use them is by using those bloodsuckers that are found in clean, stagnant waters.
And then they should be laid in the day and night in stagnant water until they become sluggish, ensuring that there is no undigested food left in their stomachs; and then evacuate the body at the beginning with bloodletting and cupping; and then rub the patient's member until it turns red; and then place them on him.
And when they are filled and full.
And if it is possible to draw the fluid from the site with a cupping glass, it is more helpful afterwards.
And if not, then wash the site with vinegar and then with warm water; and rub it and squeeze it out.
And if the flow of blood is prolonged after the removal of the bloodsuckers and it continues to ooze, then place a cloth soaked in warm water over it until the oozing stops.
E si le sanc es multiplicat, lahoras polveriza sobre lu vitriol trissat, o guallas e semblantz a lor de las causas stipticas, entro que·l sanc sia abscidit; o sian pausadas sobre le loc las maytatz de favas excocicadas, e sian layssadas entro que las favas adereschan al loc, e es le sanc abscidit.
And it is necessary, if required, to repeat bloodletting as often as possible.
And if the bloodletting is prohibited by suspension, then the area should be rubbed with fresh blood or place a needle in the spots until it draws blood; and soon they will be healed, because when they feel some blood they quickly heal.
And when you want them to close, sprinkle a little powdered alum or salt or ashes on the wounds and they will heal quickly.
Thus begins the procedure of the third part: restoration. This chapter is most necessary in the art of medicine, and it is for the restoration of broken bones and dislocated joints.
Oh, son, know that the foolish doctors and common people boast about this chapter, those who at any time did not respect the books of the Ancients nor read a letter from them.
And for this reason it is done that in our land this method of the wise is hidden; and I have not forgotten this at all times but have studied this after long reading of the books of the Ancients and study on their understanding, until I extracted the knowledge from them.
And then I directed my studies and experiments throughout the course of my life.
And I have already written about this in this chapter all that my knowledge contains and on which my experience has passed; because here I have shortened it for you others and delivered you from the occupation of length; and I have shortened it at the end of shortening; and shown it at the end of explanation; and formed many forms of the instruments used in it, as is done by addition of explanation, as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter one.
Summary and compilation of the essentials for treating bone fractures, which must be done before we begin to recall the diverse types of broken bones. Therefore, let us say in the prologue of this chapter the main points of the discourse; and the chapters which at the beginning are necessary for the craftsmen to know and be fixed upon the truth of those; thus it is you and those who are prompt and know or learn this noble art from you.
And so I say that when some fracture, dislocation, twisting or falling occurs, then it is necessary for you to begin with bloodletting or cupping that person, or both at the same time, unless some cause prohibits it, such as weakness of vitality, or if the one to whom it happens is a child, or an old person in decrepitude, or it is a time of very strong heat, or very strong cold.
And then it should be content with light foods such as herbs and bird meat, but avoid heavy meats and filling oneself too much with food that clogs the veins with blood, until you are sure of a cautious aposteme, and if you do not fear an effusion of matter in the limb.
And then return the patient to their original diet which they are accustomed to.
And when the broken bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary for the patient to be fed with nutritious foods that are rich and heavy in nutrients, such as foods made from wheat cooked in water, rice, caps, fish, cow stomachs, eggs, fresh peas, large wine and similar things. With this diet, a fracture coagulates more easily and better.
And know that broken bones in old people and the elderly cannot be continued or consolidated according to their nature due to the dryness of their members.
Certainly! Let's translate the sentence step by step:
And for this reason, it is necessary to prepare the patient's food, food that contains heaviness, stickiness, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, for a fracture of the thigh bone is different from a fracture of the skull bone; and a fracture of the foot bone is different from a fracture of the hand bone; and similarly, all other limbs differ among themselves.
And I come with the memory of every type of fracture, distinguished in its own chapter from the others.
Furthermore, there are differences among fractures within the same limb itself. And the types of bone fractures are also diversified within themselves; for there is a fracture that occurs in the form of an arch, and another that happens due to stars; and sometimes it happens according to the length of the bone: and these are the fractures of the shinbone, thighbone, and shoulder blades, whether they protrude or not, as is done with a pen when it is prepared for writing. There are also fractures with bruising and disruption in the skull, and there are small fissure fractures.
And in every way, it is either ingenious or a particular torment for the restoration of him, according to what will come as a distinct memory in its places.
Signal of bone fracture. And by this it is known as a bone fracture: it has a crookedness to it, and from that protrusion and appearance of it when feeling, and so it is when you press that with your hand.
And therefore when there is no apparent crookedness or pain from your touch, and when you touch the bone with motion and the patient does not find great pain, then it is not a fracture here.
It is possible that it is a crookedness or small crack, so you should not move it with your hand and apply pressure to everything; then place on him the medicines of which there will be a memory near that moment that suits the place; and then it should be tied tightly with a fine bandage.
And know that the place when it is curved and not divided into two or anything else does not happen to it, as all parts of its shape are lifted, then you should begin from your hour to straighten it, provided that an abscess happens to it.
And if an abscess appears on the patient, then leave it alone for several days until the abscess ceases; and then close it in whatever manner you can of lightness and skill.
And know that the patient's restoration and needlework are easier than on the bone in which this occurs, for it is a wound that heals more quickly than others.
Then strengthen him according to his recovery.
But if it is a wound in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken limb in two parts, whether it is the hand or the foot; either with your hands if the limb is small; or with two ropes or one rope and a hand.
And let your position be such that you place the limb in its natural shape while the separated parts of the broken limb are extended, then you should work to return those pieces with skill and in whatever manner you can into their places.
And take care that during your operation, no pain or injury occurs to the patient; and strive according to your ability to join one bone with its partner in the best way possible.
And it is necessary that at that time you touch with your hand what you have done, and if you see here some different cause, correct that and close it according to the amount of your ability.
And excessive stretching and compression, just as foolish doctors do with their many operations, cause the formation of an abscess due to their procedures, or they cause a contraction in the member, as we have seen this happen due to their many operations.
And the quality of the stricture of the quiet member is that which I recommend; know that broken members are diversified in their smallness and largeness and in their forms.
And for those that are small, such as the arm and the foot and the thigh, it is fitting that the bandage be of fine cloth.
But for those that are large, such as the thigh or the hip, it is necessary that the bandage be broad and strong, because a broad and strong wrap connects the large limb and holds it firmly on all sides, so that no infection enters it.
And then begin, immediately after your evacuation of excrement, place a linen cloth conveniently over the location of that fracture with three or four bandages, as the limb may require; and hold your hand firmly on the bandage for a little while.
And then come to that part of the body that is superior to the location of the fracture, and hold firmly so that your bandage does not loosen from which you have strengthened the location of the fracture. And then extend yourself with a bandage of the location of the fracture a little, and loosen the tightness gradually, until you take from the place a large part.
And then take another bandage and wrap it a second time over the broken place with a bandage, and then come to the bandages below the fracture; and let your work be in the tightness of the bandage and in the loosening of that according to what we have said in the first wrapping above.
And then place between the folds of a woolen cloth or a drape that is wrapped around the twisted nature of the fracture, if there is twisting involved; and if not, do not place anything for any reason.
And then place another bandage on top, and wrap around these well-made cloth strips immediately, if there is no swelling or abscess in the area, and then place what drains the abscess and removes the swelling; leave it for a few days; and then strengthen with more bandages.
Let the cloth strips be of hemp or flax, well-prepared and wisely formed; or they may be of pine wood; or of palm leaves; and let their width be according to this form and this figure:
However, the strip that is placed over that fracture should be thicker and slightly wider than the other strips, and the length of the strip according to the size and smallness of the limb; and then strengthen with another bandage on top according to your initial tightening, and then tie with a decent cord as we have said about tightening, and it is that your tightening should be according to the location of the fracture more, and the further from the fracture, the less tight the binding.
And it is necessary that the threads are medium in thickness and fineness, and they should be of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen through the operation of some foolish people who use their threads made of hemp cord, this is a great error, because when the stricture occurs, it would be unequal.
And likewise, very fine threads are not suitable, because you will not achieve with them the stricture you want, and it is not good that there be more than a finger's width between stitch and stitch.
And if the patient is irritated by the ends of the threads near the stricture in their places, then place beneath those cotton wool or carmended wool until it does not harm them.
Sometimes a fracture occurs with an injury, and there is a rupture in the tendon, and I will come to remember that in the following chapter by specifics.
And know that no broken limb is ever bound with bandages on the first day; the reason for this is that when the limb is large, it is not advisable to place bandages on it until about five or seven days have passed, or more, depending on your certainty of preventing an abscess.
And this is the manner of plasters with which the Ancients restored, which were placed on fractures and dislocations and twists.
And the method of plastering as a treatment for fractures is appropriate for many complex cases and especially for women and children, because it does not bring heat or cold: you should take powder from a mill, which is the soft part of the flour that accumulates on the walls of the mill.
And make it thus as described, except that you should sift it with egg white, and make the paste neither too thick nor too thin; and then use it accordingly.
Another method for plasters to restore fractures and dislocations and twists: take asafetida, laudanum, acacia, elecampane, and migraña (which is wild milfoil), all in equal parts; myrrh and aloe in five parts each; aloe-wood in twenty parts. All should be ground and sifted, and mixed with water or egg white if the wound is raw; and then use this plaster, for it has a good composition and restores broken bones gently, and you will find it useful for many men.

Here's my best guess at translating this line by line:
Another method for creating a plaster that heals fractures: take leaves of wild fig and leaves of wild poppy; crush everything together and make a plaster from them.
Another short plaster method for the restoration of bone fractures and when you want resolution of remaining abscess: take roots of mallow, chamomile flowers, and violet flowers; all finely ground and mixed with flour, then infused in wine if the limb is not broken.
But if it is broken, then prepare that with water of marjoram or water and use it.
Another method for a stronger plaster in resolving a hard abscess for the restoration of the member: take roots of mallow, seeds of flax, balm, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, all finely ground; everything crushed and infused with willow water or soft water or wine, depending on the quality of the limb and its color.
But Hippocrates does not say in his book that anything other than a wax and oil cerate should be placed on the broken limb for its restoration; and he recommends that it be moderately thick between coarseness and fineness.
Certainly! Let's translate the given sentence line by line into English:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
Here's the translation of the given sentence: And if a sudden pain or swelling or inflammation occurs at the site, then cut or remove that part immediately, and remove the plaster from it.
And take a cloth and a marine sponge soaked in warm water, and with it wash the area until the swelling ceases and the pain is relieved; then let the member rest for an hour; then place on it wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rosemary oil, and wrap it overnight to ensure that any abscess has subsided, that the inflammation of the member has diminished, and that its pain has been relieved.
Then repeat that subtle and small bandage and do not tighten it with your first constriction, and refine it until it is healed.
And if you see that the abscess and redness and pain and inflammation and all the incidents have already subsided completely, and there is no longer a need for bandages and bindings, then repeat the procedure as you did at the beginning equally.
And if no incident occurs to the member from those that we have mentioned, then do not remove it until three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes all this is left for twenty days, according to what you see in the healing of the member, as we have said, until the fracture heals and approaches the coagulation of the flesh over it.

"And I have not seen anyone do that, which is why it is more reasonable that I do not do it either.
Chapter Two: On Fractures When They Occur in the Head.
"There are many types of fractures and their shapes vary greatly, as do the causes. Some fractures are caused by a blow from an object that crushes the entire bone into splinters. This type is called comminuted, just like when one does so with wood. Or the object cuts through some part of the bone, cutting through the flesh but not completely severing it; this type of fracture is called greenstick.
"And the wound of these two types of fractures can be large or small, and it is caused by a crushing or tearing force. The cause of this is a blow with a hammer or axe onto stone, and similarly.
"And this type of fracture can either be penetrating, approaching the skin beneath the bone, or it can occur on the surface of the bone. The wound from these two types of fractures can be large or small.
"And there is another type of fracture that occurs within the bone, in the subtlety of the hairline, and for this reason this type of fracture is called hairline.
Here's the translation for the given sentence:
And this is particularly done in the bodies of young children, such as infants' heads.
And for all these types of fractures, there are weights similar to small stones separated (or distinct). And I will come back with a reminder of all this in its place.
And one should recognize all these types of fractures by detection on them and by examination with tests and removal of corrupt flesh that is on them.
And the capillary type is known by this: it is discovered on the bone, and it is washed, and smeared on it with a test, because the fracture appears black.
However, in the treatment of fractures, consider at the beginning the conditions of the patient, and then if you see by the conditions that they indicate by clear signs of fear, such as vomiting of bile, extension (of limbs), loss of consciousness, hoarseness of voice, syncope, acute fever, discharge from the eyes and redness of them, and similar to these symptoms in the major dispositions, without a doubt it will not heal.
And if you see non-serious conditions, you hope for health; then you begin the treatment of him.
The translation of the given text is as follows:
And if it is in the days of summer, then it is necessary to cut off the bone before the seventh day, having that which is beneath the bone become corrupt due to the fat, and let the accidents we have mentioned occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the fat covering the brain and is in small pieces and crushed, then it is necessary to incise the comminuted and crushed piece, as I will now describe to you.
And it is that you should shave the head of the patient and uncover the bone according to custom and your best ability, following the shape of the wound, and be gentle with the patient.
And if you find that there is a fracture of the bone, or an excessive flow of blood or a pus-filled wound, then you should apply to it what is necessary: and that is, fill the area with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and let the wound rest until the pus subsides and you are sure there is no bleeding; and then begin with the circumcision of the bone and its removal.
And this should be done according to one of two methods of operation.
And the first method is that you incise the bone with a narrow chisel like this, and this is its shape. And then administer another chisel of this kind, a little wider than that one; and this is its shape.
And then administer more of the incision fluid than the second [step].
And it is necessary that you have a diverse number of incision tools, some of which are broader than others; and some are shorter than others, and they should be very sharp at their ends, and they should be made of iron or steel.
And use them easily by tapping on the incision tools so that you do not pierce the skin and hurt the patient.
And if the bone is strong and hard, then it is necessary to bore around it before you administer the incision tools with the drills, which are called non-penetrating drills.
And they are not called this way only because these do not reach the end of the bone until it is near, but also because the drill has a round tip or margin at its end that prevents it from being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take a large number of these drills, each one suitable for the thickness of each bone, until you have in your possession all the tools for every bone in the skull, each with an acute tip and dimensions appropriate to the thickness of that bone.
This is a complex medical description involving three types of trepanation techniques for treating fractured bones. Here's the line-by-line translation:
E then incise with an incisor where it is between each gap of the bone, and make that pus as subtle as you can on that end for lightness, just as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with some other cause by certain instruments which you will prepare for this purpose, such as fine needles and delicate forceps.
And be sure to guard with all caution that the incisor does not touch any part of the bone.
And then, when you have circumcised the bone and it is separated from the flesh if it is attached to it, and you have extracted it, it is necessary to scrape and clean that rough part of the bone with another instrument similar to an incisor, but nevertheless it must be thinner and more subtle than other incisors.
And if any small and splintered parts of the bones remain, then take them out easily with one of the instruments that you have; and then cure the wound with linen cloths and ointments as we have said.
And another method of operation is gentle and far from fear, which Galen says and praises greatly; and this is his speech: it is necessary at the beginning that you begin to uncover the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most violent and manifest, until when you have uncovered that part and placed under it the tip of a sharp and gentle incisor, of which this is the form:
Based on the given pattern and the context of medieval medical treatises, here's my attempt at translating the sentence:
And immediately strike the incision of a part with a small hammer until all the bones are cut through, as is customary, and be sure of the skin that no accident happens to it in any way, and if the patient is the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, and if he is asleep.
And if there is any cause attached to the skin over the bones in some places of bone, cut that off him with the point of the incisor, and deliver it from him with ease, for it is delivered from him without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate into the skin, and that which is cut off or removed from the bone is the surface of it, and roughness and subtle splinters remain in it, then it is necessary to scrape away that roughness and remove those splinters with fine razors, prepared in diverse quantities so that you may administer them in all places most conveniently and rightly according to how your operation is conducted on that broken bone and its shape.
And it is necessary that you administer with your razor at the beginning the widest of those razors, and immediately use afterwards the most subtle of them, and do not cease to do this continuously until you arrive at administering the most wide and the most subtle of all.
In any of the other small, hairline, or subtle fractures, you should administer care according to what has been lost for its correction.
And it is necessary that one does not rush over all those who have studied in this art. And pay attention to what we have written concerning large fractures.
And if the skin is torn when you remove the bone, then take a cloth according to the size of the wound and soak it in heated oil; place it over the opening of the wound. Then take another cloth, folded or tripled, and soak it in vinegar and heated oil, and place it over the first cloth. Do this as lightly as possible to avoid causing harm. Then administer a linen bandage on top, but do not tighten it more than is necessary for the size of the wound alone.
And leave it with this care for one day or two until you are sure that the inflammation is under control; then uncover it and administer medicines that have a drying effect, such as linseed poultice, barley flour, powder of ash and aristolochia, and similar substances.
Based on the provided pattern and context, here's a line-by-line translation of the sentence:
And beware according to your skill that the wound in your care is clean; and let there be no trace of ointment or anything else on it; nor allow virulence to increase within it; for when it is pressed against the cerebral membrane, it corrupts and poisons it, and this malignancy occurs to the patient nearby.
And if it happens in the vault of the skull, when the bone is exposed and especially when its care is neglected, and there is darkness on its surface; and then consider if these accidents happen to the patient, as we have said, know that it is a fatal condition without any doubt.
And if darkness does not occur except from the medicine that is placed on it, and it is due to the power of that medicine that the darkness occurs, then you should take one part of honey and three parts of oil, and with those, line a cloth, and then place it on the vault; and then heal it with the appropriate healing spices until it is healed.
Chapter III.
On the restoration of the nose when it has been cut off.
Know that the nose is not cut in two parts at once, but rather one of those superior parts alone, because there are two bones within it; the lower part is cartilaginous and cannot be cut, and thus only a bruise and deformation occur in it.
However, if one of the two parts is broken, then you should insert your little finger into his nose, and close that fracture from inside with your index finger, and push it outward with your thumb until the nose returns to its natural shape. And let this be done by you with ease, and ensure that it does not fall on the patient during your operation.
And if the fracture is in the uppermost part of the nose and the nostril does not reach it, then it should be made equal with the tip of the ray on which it has been fractured.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you will make them similar to each other.
And you will take care of his restoration on the first day after the fracture, if possible; and if not, then on the seventh or tenth day, let him rest from the cautery of the abscess.
And then insert a wick of linen into the tip of the nose if the fracture is in one part, or place two small sticks, if the fracture is in two parts, and let them be of sufficient size to fill the hole in the nose.
And thus say some of the ancient restorers that the sticks should be wrapped in cloth and changed every day, but I have not seen this; it is better for the wick to be soaked in egg white mixed with powdered chalk; and then let the stick remain until the bone has healed and the cartilage has hardened.
This sentence is discussing the treatment of a nose injury or breakage. Here's a line-by-line translation:
And for this reason it is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do this, and if you wish, do that.
And if another abscess occurs, apply a plaster on the nose with wax or cotton soaked in vinegar and oil, or with diachylon.
But if the abscess does not occur, then you should apply a plaster to that area from outside with sesame flour and powdered iris mixed with egg white; and then place over it a leek stopper, and do not touch the nose for any reason.
But if the bones of the nose are broken or crushed, then you should cut into them and remove the fragments with appropriate instruments; then close the wound, and heal it with a solution that promotes healing and strengthening, and with suitable plasters.
And if there is a wound inside the nose, then you should treat it with that (medicine) and administer lead tubes until it is completely healed.
Chapter IV
On the restoration of the jaw when it is broken.
When the jaw has been broken and the fracture is not due to a wound, first consider if the fracture is only on the outside and not broken in two, and it is bent inward at the edges, then its recognition is easy. ›
And therefore, if the fracture is in the right part, you should insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; similarly, if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert the said index finger of the right hand; and with that, push out the swelling of the fracture inside with ease to the outside parts, with your other hand from the outside of the bone; and with that, gently align it.
And if the jaw fracture is already separated into two parts, then it is necessary to administer a stretching of both parts according to the straight alignment until the alignment is possible.
And if there is a dislocation of teeth due to the fracture, then strengthen those that you expect will remain with gold or silver wire or silk thread; and then place over the broken jaw some wax, and then place a doubled cloth, and place over it a large star-shaped pad properly made, or a sole leather strip equal in length to the jaw; and then tie it on top according to how you are equipped for binding and as needed for application, until it is not destroyed.
And order the patient to rest and be calm, and give them food in the form of thin porridges.
And if you think that the shape has already been altered in some way, then you cut and open it on the third day; and then rectify what has already been altered from it and plaster it with powder of mill, with egg white, or with sesame flour, since you will have removed the wart from it, and place wool over the plaster.
And when that plaster is attached and firmly placed on it, and the bone's position has not been altered, leave it in place without removing it until it is healed and strengthens the break; for many times this break is healed within three weeks.
And if in another case an abscess forms, then administer what we have said many times in its treatment until it is healed and the abscess has been removed.
And if the break is with a wound, then consider whether it is a separated piece of bone or splinters; in that case, you should be careful to remove those splinters with whatever is suitable for removing those kinds of foreign objects.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should widen it with a scalpel according to your needs.
Sure, let's break down the sentence and translate it line by line:
Capítulo V
Sobre la restauración de la clavícula cuando está rota.
A menudo se rompe la clavícula desde el músculo delantero y esta fractura puede ocurrir de tres maneras diferentes.
Porque puede estar rota, separada o separada en dos partes sin que haya astillas; y su restauración es fácil. O puede ser que haya astillas, lo cual dificulta su restauración. O puede ser que la fractura esté con una placa.
Y la operación en este caso, cuando la fractura está con una placa, es que haya presente dos asistentes, para que uno sea el ayudante y siga la clavícula rota, y el otro extienda el cuello hacia esa parte.
Luego, aproxima la fractura con tus dedos hasta que se forme correctamente y no haya prominencias ni depresiones.
Y si necesitas más extensión, entonces coloca debajo del hueso del paciente una almohada de tela o lana, y su tamaño debe ser acorde a la cantidad de extensión requerida; extiende y eleva la clavícula y corta la almohada con tu mano hasta que aproximes la fractura como es debido.
Based on the given text and its translation, let's break down this sentence:
And the assistant presses the patient's muscles in the separated parts until the bone of the collarbone is raised, which is on top. Then you correct the fracture and bandage it with your words.
But if you feel splinters of the collarbone and they are painful, then you should cut over that area and remove those splinters with ease.
And if it is stuck in the bone, then you should ingeniously cut it out with one of the knives that you have prepared for this purpose, because you had placed under the collarbone the tool that serves to probe; and this tool is made of wood or iron, the form of which is as follows:
And it is similar to a hook with which the following is its concavity; and let its length be according to what you need from it, according to the size of the bone or its smallness.
But let the length of it be according to what is possible for you during the operation; that it has two ends like this, and one end is wide and the other is narrow.
And if the wound that you have cut when you extracted the splinter from the bone is wide, and you are sure of an impending abscess, then you should join the two lips of the wound with stitches.
And if the injury is slight or you fear a post-infection (apostema), then fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the cut.
And if you fear an abscess (apostema), then pour vinegar and oil into a cloth, and place it on the affected area.
And everything should not be covered with a blanket over the broken bones; therefore, you must see the patient every day to ensure that when the bandage is softened or the blanket is raised, then you correct this and strengthen the bandage.
And then place the patient's pillow under his neck, and underneath his head you should put a small cushion at night; so that with this, the helper is raised on his side, and thus the fracture of the collarbone is elevated by the muscle lift; or it could be that his arm is tied to his side.
Do not untie the bandage unless you find in the place more swelling or pus within twelve days.
Then renew the plaster if you see his face change like this, and adjust it in the stricture and restore that, and leave it until the collarbone fracture is healed and clotted.
And it is strengthened and made comfortable according to the month in twenty-eight days, and sometimes in some men it is done in a few months of that time.
Chapter VI
Of the restoration of the shoulder fracture.
The shoulder blade is often broken in the back part of it and not broken from it but only the edges.
And therefore, when the place of him is broken — and it is broken in the middle part of him — and it is not known except by touch, then according to the shape of the fracture, forcefully take its preparation and reduce it according to the natural form in every way possible with your mind.
And then place on the area powder made from ground alum and egg white, sealed with wax; and then place on it folded cloth; and then place on him a thin sheet of wood according to the size of the entire spatula or slightly more.
But if the wooden sheet has any concavity in some parts of the spatula, then fill that concavity with wax and then adjust the sheet until it is level.
And then strengthen it on top with a long piece of cloth with proper constriction and the firmness of the sheet, so that it will not move from its place.
And check the bandage every day; and whenever it is soaked, change it and reinforce it and level the sheet if it has moved from its place.
And make sure to keep the patient on their side.
And the spatula is restored in 20 days or in 25.
And when this period is completed, then you should remove the bandage and be assured that the bone has healed, for neither its beginning nor its healing is feared.
And if it is a bone protruding from the wound, remove it as you would with an aposteme, and treat it as we have said in the case of a broken furcula or clavicle.
The text you provided is written in Occitan, which was spoken in Southern France during the Middle Ages. Here's a line-by-line translation of "Capitol .vii.":
Of the restoration of the broken foot.
The foot is sometimes broken in the middle part of it, and that delays healing; but its ends move faster because they are cut and divided.
And of its accidents when it is broken in the middle part, it inclines towards the divided parts and causes great pain, difficulty breathing, coughing, a strong fever, and vomiting blood; and there is an evident cavity in the broken bone, which is not hidden from feeling.
And its restoration is that the patient be placed on his back and a cushion be placed between his shoulders; and then press down on his muscles and adjust his ribs with two hands, and be subtle in the operation of him and in the setting according to every manner possible and convenient for this purpose until the bone returns to its proper shape.
Then place over him a plaster and cloth and then place over it a thin wooden splint of willow or hazel or similar light wood wrapped in linen; and then be careful to tie that over the broken bone so that it is not too tight; and go with binding according to roundness on the back sometimes, and strengthen that with decent firmness; and then consider the binding always, and when it becomes soft strengthen it.
And if the necessity arises to remove that pus or inflammation, or pain, or abscess that occurs in that place, then you cut and clean that area and remove the emplaster and correct what happens there with the manner of curing it; then return the emplaster if it fits on the surface; and adjust a stricture until it is healed.
Chapter VIII.
On the restoration of ribs when they are dislocated.
Know that a fracture of the ribs does not happen except in thick places such as the back; and in their extremities from the front, contusion does not occur there except because they are cartilaginous. And knowledge of it is not hidden to feeling except by inquiring about it with the fingers.
And the restoration should be such that one encloses the fracture with the fingers according to the possible manner, until it is swallowed as needed, and then apply and strengthen the broken bone with iron, if necessary.
And if the fracture of the ribs inclines towards the inner parts, then there is for the patient a very severe pain and puncturing, just as the puncturing that happens to someone with pleurisy, and because of this the bone pierces the diaphragm; and it causes difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting much blood; and this is difficult to cure. 😊
And already the Ancients have invented this with ingenious words.
And of this they say: it is necessary to place the patient's food on top to induce flatulence and bloating so that the belly becomes swollen and extended, and the fracture is pushed outwards to its parts.
But we prefer this method to avoid causing an abscess, unless it has already occurred; and if it has already occurred, then it helps with that.
And some of them say that it should be placed on top of the bladder and then sucked with force; and this seems reasonable, but nevertheless it is feared that the bladder will draw the excess fluids to the site due to its weakness.
And some of them say: the site should be covered with wool that has been soaked in hot oil, and cushions should be placed between the ribs until it is filled, so that the dressing is equal on all sides like an envelope; and then the patient should be treated with a diet and medicine for pleurisy.
And if the patient suffers from intense pain that they cannot bear, and the bones pierce the membrane with a tooth-like point, we fear for the patient; then it is necessary to cut open the site, expose the broken rib, and then place over it an instrument that preserves the pus, which was mentioned earlier; and we should easily cut the bone and extract it.
And now that we have adjusted both lips of the wound, if it is large, with stitching, and we treat it with dressings until it is healed.
And if an abscess occurs inside, then cut and insert woolen plugs soaked in oil into the area, and let the patient be cured with whatever is appropriate for the internal abscess.
And he should be placed on his back on the bed where he sleeps until he is healed.
Chapter IX.
On the restoration of a broken vertebra in the back and neck.
Sometimes there is a fracture of the bones in the neck, and then it has swelling, as well as the vertebrae in the back. And if this happens to someone and you want to know if he will be cured or not, then consider this: if you see his hands already softened and numb and dead and he cannot move those nor extend nor strengthen those, and when you squeeze those with your fingers or prick those with a needle and he does not feel pain in them, then you know that he will not be cured, and in the same way it is fatal.
And if he moves those and feels constriction with the fingers and the pricking, then you know that the bone of the neck is safe and that the patient will be cured with treatment.
And if you see something similar to this on the spine of the neck and you want to know whether it will heal or not, then consider his feet.
And if you see that they are already softened, do to them what was done to the hands, and then when lying on their back, there is flatulence and evacuation without their consent, and sometimes they are turned onto their back and want to urinate but cannot, then know that it is fatal, and therefore do not labor in their cure.
But if none of these things happen, the cause is better and lighter.
And his cure is that you perforate the aposteme with a heated needle and place over it on the inflamed spine oil alone, or with mallow juice added; place this on him several times during the day until the aposteme is drained.
And then place a soothing and strengthening poultice on it, and bind it strongly with a bandage; and order the patient to rest and be calm, and not to sleep on the painful side until healed.
And if there is an exudate from the bone or any other cause that has already separated from it, then it is necessary to cauterize on the tendon and remove that bone; and then close the two lips of the wound with stitches if it is large; and then cure it with some healing ointment until healed.
If the tip of the bone is broken and it's at the end of the spine, then you should insert your left index finger into the anus, and with the other hand, straighten the broken bone as much as possible according to its natural alignment; then place a plaster and bandage on him if you have them, and strengthen that.
If you feel broken ribs in him, then make an incision over it, remove it, and heal the wound with the prescribed treatment until it is healed.
Chapter X
Of the restoration of the jaw.
The jaw bones are often broken, and if they break, the fracture is not severe but occurs at the ends of the bone and extends inward along its length; and it happens that the patient feels pain in the area and a puncturing sensation, and the leg becomes numb when it breaks.
And the restoration of it is that you should place your hand over it until it matches the shape of the fracture.
And if the fracture is only at the end of it, then straighten that part according to its natural alignment until it resembles its natural shape.
If the fracture is in the shin or near the knee joint, then make the patient lie on their back until you are prepared to set the fracture. When you have wrapped it, place a poultice on the patient, and then place a splint of wood or leather on top, and bind it securely so that you do not fear displacement of the fracture or movement of the splint.
And wrap the cavity with a bandage that fills it until it takes on the same tightness, and instruct the patient to sleep either on their back or on their side.
But if you see a cold abscess developing, then cease from stretching and restoring until the cold abscess is settled, and place upon it a bandage that settles it as has been said before; and afterwards return to restoring it, and bind it so as is necessary.
And if it happens in the shin bones or they are splintered, then draw them out.
Chapter XI
Of the restoration of the dislocated hip.
The hip is that which is between the thigh and the head of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is done in one of two ways. One way is for you to take a dowel of medium thickness according to this manner:
And two ligaments should be tied on both ends, and then it should be suspended from an elevated location.
Then have the patient sit on a chair, and next throw out their broken arm over the dowel until it reaches the middle part of the body where the curve of the dowel is located.
Then suspend it on that for some serious cause, or the servant should extend it to its parts below; and then the doctor should touch the fracture with his hands together until the fracture returns as needed.
The other method is that the patient should be made to lie on their back with their neck suspended by a ligament around it, and then order two servants: one of them should hold what is above the fracture with his hands; and the other should hold below the patient; and each of them should extend to their respective part.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you should strengthen over the fracture with a ligament and on that with another ligament, and each of the two servants should extend to their respective parts.
And therefore, if the fracture is near the end of the muscle, then it should be that half of the bandage is placed on the shin and the other half below the fracture towards the elbow.
And similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then it should be that the bandage is placed on that location and on that elbow.
Wrap it with ease and without effort, and as soon as it is wrapped according to what is needed and has been applied properly, then strengthen that wrap if an abscess does not form.
But if an abscess does form, then leave the stricture for seven days, and place over it wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the abscess subsides, and then strengthen that [wrap].
And the manner of strengthening that is to place a poultice over the fracture, and then place a bandage of new cloth over the poultice; and then adjust the arm on that support, and place your open hand on its own muscle.
And wrap the cloth and secure the arm to the support so that the arm is in place, unless there is some reason why the broken bone should not be immobilized.
And then use of straw is made.
And you should place on the fracture that straw which is more wide and stronger than the other straws; and place between each straw the width of a finger, and let the length of the straws be according to the fracture with an addition of three fingers from all sides.
Then strengthen over the straws with the binding that was mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And let your binding on the place of the fracture be tighter. And the longer the fracture is, the narrower should be the binding.
And thus if you see the arrangement of the straws and the binding as we have said in the time when you restore the member to its place, then do so.
And if you fear a post-operation abscess, then leave the binding and the straws in place for seven days as we have said.
And then consider the ligature in all parts for three days so that swelling or inflammation does not occur in the place; or it is prohibited that food reaches the member by superfluous binding; and thus rectify everything as we have said.
But if you are confident that none of this will happen, then do not untie the ligature until after three days or more.
And let the patient's sleep be upon his back, and his hands should be on his stomach.
And place a full cushion of wool over the helper, and always be mindful throughout the night or day that the form of the broken member is not disrupted or dissolved, or that the bandage becomes softened; therefore, correct this with all your skill.
And let the patient's food be prepared according to the order we have given before, so that the food is light at first until he begins to strengthen; then it is necessary to make his food thicker.
Because it is customary for the helper and the patient's thigh to be strengthened in forty days; therefore, they should be unbound and given a bath, and medicines that correct them should be administered.
And if the break is fresh, then you must not unbind that bandage and the splints before ten days or two months have passed.
Chapter XII.
On the Restoration of a Fractured Arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called the ulna and radius. One of them is small, and this is called the thumb, and the other is large and is placed below the small one, closer to the hand.
"And if the larger fire is lit alone or the smaller one, and they are both lit quickly.
"And when the small fire is lit on top, then its restoration is easier, and its healing is even quicker.
"And when the fire is lit beneath it, then its breakage is bad, and its healing is difficult.
"And worse than that is when two bones are broken at once.
"Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the small fire on top, then it is fitting for the doctor to make a small incision with ease before it becomes swollen.
"But if it is the large fire that is lit, then a more vigorous incision is required.
"And if both fires are lit at once, then you must make the incision very strongly.
"And you must make the incision with your hand stretched out over a cushion, and let the pulse of your hand be at the top, as well as all the others, and let the patient lie on a low chair.
"And there should be a cushion in front of him at the level or height of him, so that the patient does not slip.
And then the minister extends the arm from the side downward with his hand or bandage, and another minister does the same above.
And then the physician dislocates the bone until it returns to its proper shape.
And if there are splinters in the fracture of the bone, then you should drill out all the dirt with your skill.
And if it appears that the splinter is separate and it touches the bone without hope for its restoration, then you should cut it off and remove it in the manner that we mentioned above.
But if the fracture is with an injury, I have already made a separate chapter on that subject, and therefore take care of it accordingly.
And if an abscess occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then you should line a cloth with oil-rose and white wax ointment, which is moderate between subtlety and strength, and bind a strong, thin cloth over it until the abscess subsides; then remove the ointment and place a prepared plaster of powdered mulberry leaves mixed with egg whites, and then place stones; and let the stone that is placed on that fracture be wider and stronger.
And know that the number of stars in the arm can be seen in the greatest dispositions, whether it is a fracture in one finger or two fingers at once.
Then place your bandage on the site of the fracture more strongly and vigorously, and when it reaches the parts above the fracture or the parts below it, apply the bandage a little wetter, as was mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist, not hard or rough, and the thread with which it is secured should be medium-weight, neither too fine nor too coarse, as we have advised.
And examine the limb and its bandage after some days. And if there is any cause for which correction is necessary, such as swelling that occurs in the limb, then you should immerse the limb in warm water until that swelling subsides.
And let the member rest unbound until it recovers, and then reapply the bandage.
And if the bandage has already softened and the bone has healed to the point of appearing similar, then correct everything with your skill.
And consider if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the member due to excessive stricture, for then it is necessary to soften that part slightly and leave it alone for a few days until the nourishment reaches that part, and then strengthen that part.
But if the patient does not experience any of the causes we have mentioned, then it is not necessary to release them for about 20 days or thereabouts.
And thus the hand of the patient should be suspended due to its habitual agitation, and make them sleep on their back.
And know that this fracture is restored in 30 days or 32 days, or if it is a very slight one, it is restored in 28 days, and all of this depends on the condition of the complexions and the nature of the individual.
Chapter XIII.
On the restoration of a broken finger or toe.
Know that a finger or toe may fracture easily and nothing more serious happens to them than some bruising.
And when the hand or foot suffers from a fracture or bruising, then it is necessary for the patient to sit down and lie before them, placing a cushion under their hand or foot according to its position.
And immediately the minister extends the broken bones, and the doctor joins them until they are well united with good union.
And then it is necessary to place a plaster and cloth on it, lest an abscess form; and immediately place a steel plate over it according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped that in a linen cloth.
But if the fracture is in the fingers, you must place your palm against the inside of it. Then make something resembling a ball from cloth, and command the patient to hold that with their broken hand; immediately bind it tightly with long cloth.
And let there be a heart-shaped piece of leather with cloth in which the heart is placed, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and bind it as tightly as needed.
But if the fracture is on the outside of the fingers, then it is necessary to place a steel plate over it and another plate under the palm, so that the hand may be open and straight; and immediately bind the splint as the hand is turned little by little with bandages between the said bones.  />
And if there is a fracture of any of the bones of the fingers, then if it is a pointed finger, join it as needed and immediately bind it to the palm, and if you wish, place a small straight steel plate under it so that the fracture may be raised and not worsened.

"About the restoration of a thighbone fracture.
"The thighbone, which is often observed, is broken and it becomes evident to the sense according to how it has split into parts before and above.
"And the restoration of it is done in such a way that one ligament is strengthened on the fracture and another ligament below the fracture, and the patient is made to lie on their stomach and face.
"And then the minister extends all the ligaments according to its nature, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
"But if it is towards the hip, then let the ligament be close to the knee in the region of the patella, so that the extension fits there, and the other ligament below the fracture.
"And similarly, if the break is towards the knee, then let the ligament be made close to the knee, and let the extension be at the parts below.
"And then the physician binds the bone with both his hands until he reduces it according to its natural appearance and the bone is united by a good union; then it is necessary to place a plaster and bandage, otherwise an abscess may occur in the limb. Here's the translation for the given sentence:

Certainly! Let's break down the sentence and translate it step by step:
And then fill the empty spaces between the thigh and the hip with soft cloths, so that the swelling may be reduced.
And then begin with a strong binding in the middle over the place of the fracture with three or four wraps, and the more you distance yourself from the place of the fracture, let your binding be smaller, lighter, and moister.
And then extend two ends of the string to each side until they reach the ankle of the foot, and strengthen both ends of the straps on the other side so that the binding is not dislodged from its place.
And then loosen the binding so that it does not cause corruption or abscess in the member, nor swelling and similar things; and if any of these occurs, then beware of him, and correct what has happened immediately, as we have said many times.
But if the bone presses against the skin, then you must bandage it as best as you can; and if not, place a pillow on top of it and cover it, and treat with that which has been previously mentioned until it is healed.

"About the repair of a broken nose bone.
"Know that a break in the nasal bone usually takes time to heal, but it may happen more quickly than expected.
"But if the break occurs suddenly, it is only a crack or tear in its parts, with or without blood, and everything depends on how one feels about it.
"And the repair of it is such that what is broken from its parts should be made equal by placing it between them so that it can be joined and united as much as possible according to convenience and ability.
"Then place a plaster and put it on that round piece of wood, if necessary; and strengthen it above with a bandage as needed.
"And also consider all the measures that we have recommended for other fractures, such as treating inflammation and applying similar treatments so that you can prevent any accidents and provide what is needed until it is healed.

Chapter XVI: On the restoration of a broken thigh bone.
Know that in the thigh there are two bones, one of which is large and is called by the name of the thigh bone, and the other is thin and is called the fibula.
And it happens to each of the species of fracture that affects both bones of the arm, and therefore its restoration is done in the same way as the restoration of the arm, with one operation.
And if two bones are broken together, the thigh becomes completely shattered.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the thigh becomes shattered in front.
And if the larger bone is broken, you will find that behind, and this is one of those cases that are not familiar to you.
Then administer extension, equilibrium, and ligamentation of the bones in the same manner.
However, it is necessary that if the thigh fracture is jagged with many splinters, the extension should be less and lighter, and relieve it with your skill.
And in the thigh there is some cause for operation on the arm, and this happens when you join the splinters and complete all of your operations; then you will take weights made from pine wood, which are placed under the arches that are usually placed on soles, and these are made equally of palm branches. Choose from these those with a small thickness, not too thick, and their length should be according to the length of the thigh, and from the inside towards the back.
And then wrap each leg in two layers of cloth according to its length, and place one on the top of one thigh and the other on the other thigh, and let them reach as far down as the base of the foot.
And then bind the two shins in three places: at both ends and in the middle. With this structure, the thigh is prevented from bending to either side or the other, and it remains in a good position.
And now, administer a splint of wood according to the length of the thigh; and place it on the thigh so that it may maintain its position and prevent movement.
And it is especially important to do this in the case of a fracture, for with that comes pain specifically.
And then consider the thigh each day and study it to see if there has been any improvement; and you should guard against swelling or inflammation or other similar causes; and if any of these things occur, then apply to it what is needed until it is healed.
### Chapter XVII.
Of the fracture of the ankle and the bones of the foot and toes.
The ankle does not fracture entirely, but the bones of the foot sometimes do; and the toes of the foot rarely fracture, and it only happens to them in cases of predisposition.
It seems like you've provided a sentence to translate from the medieval medical treatise, but I don't see it in your message. Please provide the source sentence so that I can help translate it for you.
Here is the translation of the given sentence:
And then place a plaster and wool on top, and place underneath the sole of the foot a small board with two flat sides.
And then strengthen it by firmly bandaging the foot after you have wrapped it in cloth and other materials that are needed.
And after three or four days have passed, then you should unbind it, for you will find the bones either swollen, or fractured, or dislocated, and the operation on them is as you know.
But if some [bones] are broken, then set them and swathe them as I have instructed you in the setting of broken bones of the hand. And then place under the broken bone a splint according to the length of the bone, and let it be somewhat wider than it; and then underneath the foot place this board that has been recommended to you, and bind it firmly.
But if what is broken are two or three or more bones, then place over each bone a splint of the appropriate size wrapped in linen cloth, and bind the board to the bottom of the foot, and let it stand on one of the flat sides of the board under the sole of the foot so that it holds it well.
And it is appropriate for you to not forget that you should consider all the causes which have been told to you in other fractures of the accidents that we have mentioned; and prepare yourself for every accident with what is necessary.
Chapter XVIII.
Of the break in the vagina and the bone of the penis and the man's penis.
When the vagina of the woman is broken, then have her sit in a chair with her legs spread apart, and then incline her towards the back slightly, and let her be held from behind.
And then the midwife should fill the vagina with cotton, and it should be done in her vagina like this; and then the woman should be shaken, and her back should be raised little by little, because all of this is forgotten until the part where the vagina is, as seen, and the bone returns.
And then place pillows on her back, and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton with ease, and then urinate, and return and go back according to the manner in which you used that at first, and then return to her first pillow.
And do this for seven days or around that, because after that it is healed.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and place on its opening a reed tube; then insert the entire bladder into his wound, and immediately blow into the reed until the bladder is inflated within the wound, because the fracture will return.
Then it should be filled with cotton and left for several days, as we have advised, until he is healed.
And when the bones of a man or woman are broken, then administer to their restoration and healing what we have advised for the hip bone.
And that which is right is not hidden in these close fractures and those that occur rarely, especially to one who has some study and practice and understands this my book well; for that fracture indicates to you the major dispositions by the right path in the restoration and tightening of it, and therefore understand well.  />
But in the case of a man's penis when it is broken, take a woolen sock, and put the penis inside; then place over it a cloth covering, and let it be wrapped up, and leave it like this for three days or around that time, and it will be healed.
Capitolo XIX.
Capítulo XIX. Sobre el tratamiento de las fracturas óseas cuando están en la fase de llaga (herida abierta).
Es conveniente para quien sufre una fractura con herida abierta, y especialmente si el hueso es grande, como el fémur o la tibia, o similar a estos, que te cortes y realices flebotomía en él lo antes posible, si las condiciones de la flebotomía así lo permiten, tal como hemos dicho anteriormente.
Y si la herida fluye sangre, entonces debes cortar y hacer una ligadura para detener el flujo de sangre, pulverizando sobre ella alumbre en polvo, a menos que haya otra razón presente.
Y entonces procede a reducir la fractura el mismo día, y no postergues esto, a menos que ocurra un absceso.
Pero si ocurre un absceso, entonces debes esperar hasta el noveno día para realizar la reducción, después de que el absceso haya disminuido. No te acerques a él en el tercer día ni en el cuarto, porque causarás accidentes graves.
Pero si el hueso roto está prominente y expuesto en la herida, entonces debes hacer todo lo posible para reducirlo y alinearlo con tus manos de manera fácil y sin mucha tensión.
Based on the given text and your request, here is a line-by-line translation of the provided source sentence:
And if it is round and there is little fat on it, so that it does not double over, you should have consideration for that during the operation.
And if it is of sharp extremity, having a margin in its extremities; and if the upper part of it is becoming thicker, and from the middle of it to the separated parts.
And this is its shape:
And in Greek it is called "labrys of the willing," which means small shovel.
Therefore, it is necessary that the sharp edge be raised and placed on the prominent bone's extremity.
And push it once until the bone returns, and then equalize it with some pressure.
And therefore, strive to equalize the fracture's edges between them. And if the broken edge is thin and does not accept the instrument well, then it is necessary that you insert the sharp edge of the bone until the instrument has power over it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone completely with what we have mentioned, then incise it with what is appropriate for it from among the incisions that we have described; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever manner is possible for you.
And immediately scrape off that which remains in the bones of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone has been reduced, and immediately after the reduction the patient feels a violent toothache, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and then do this which you will find very helpful for the patient.
When you have finished the restoration that you do on the bone, then immediately immerse a cloth in black stiptic wine, especially if it is summer, and do not place wax or any other oily substance on the wound, so that it does not become infected and corrupt.
And immediately administer steel needles at the time of your completion of the bone restoration, and leave the wound uncovered so that you can inject the pus with forceps and use bandages according to the size of the wound.
And be careful not to strain the wound with the fracture, for many times have foolhardy doctors done this, and brought about death or severe illness on their patients, which is unhealthy. And if the tightness is slight, soften it, as it is different from the tightness of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a bad wound, and you fear severe complications that we have described, and you find pain in the area, then it is not advisable to place cushions on it, but rather make a firm bandage of cloths around it and tighten it with those.
And after one or two days when the wound has begun to fester, you should remove the cloth that you had placed on it with grease, and then apply a poultice, which is an ointment we commonly use to treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacum or similar.
And you should ensure that the bandage is removed and examine the wound every day in the morning and evening until it is healed and firm, and it is necessary for the limb to be prepared in such a way that the pus drains from it easily to the surrounding areas.
If many days have passed and the wound is neither healed nor has released pus, then know that here are maggots at work, for which reason you should probe the wound with a needle. And of those maggots, those that are separated and removed, but those that are not separated and affect the limb and cause pain, try to cut them out as best you can.
If the wound becomes infected or festering, which is another form of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary to apply one of those [remedies] that are suitable for this condition, as described in the previous chapter on its treatment.
And regarding this matter on which my statement should focus and you should apply your skill: when the bone is crushed, it protrudes over the member like the bones of the pelvis and hip, and similar to those of large members; do not attempt to pull it out or extract it, for many times this has led to death. Leave that [bone] within [the body], so that it may rot away, because it will fall off on its own in about 20 to 30 days; then treat the wound if you see fit, and if not, leave it alone.
Chapter 20
Of the treatment of knots that occur as a result of some fracture.
This knotting occurs frequently in the wake of bone fracture healing, especially near the joints, and is shaped according to the figure of the member; it strongly hinders the member from its natural operation.
Based on the given context and similarity to medieval medical treatises, here's a line-by-line translation of the provided text:
And let there be no stricture that you should release it for many days; and then release it and apply another, until the swelling is reduced; or press on that lead plate firmly, because lead has the property of reducing all inflammation in the limbs.
But if the swelling has already turned to stone and is tight and necessitates being removed carefully, then you should cut it in the highest part of the body, and cut away the excess and prominent parts, or scrape it with sharp scrapers until it is reduced; and care for it until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
On the restoration of a fracture, when it is restored, and then something remains in the limb as fine and brittle according to its nature.
When a bone fracture is restored, and something remains in the limb as fine and brittle, this occurs for several reasons: one of which is excessive thinning of the ligaments and their binding, not done according to what is needed; or due to excessive tightness of the bindings until nutrients are prevented from reaching the limb; or due to excessive superfluous splinting; or due to unnecessary movement at the wrong time; or due to insufficient blood in the patient's body and their weakness.
Translation:
And now place a cup over the member, so that the cup draws to it the nourishing substance, or continue to wash it with warm water, until the nourishment flows and returns to its natural shape.
Chapter XXII.
On the treatment of bones that have been broken and improperly reset, and on the prohibition of their operation for this reason.
When a broken bone that has already been reset begins to heal improperly with prominence and nodules, and this is due to the incorrect shape of the limb, nevertheless, the limb is not prohibited from its natural operation, therefore you should not heed the words of those who believe that the limb has been broken anew.
However, there have been many foolish physicians and restorers who have done this in our land; and this operation is very blameworthy, leading to great fear of the sign of which is fatal.
But if there is recent swelling and nodules, then they should be washed with warm water in which softening herbs have been cooked, such as marshmallow leaves and roots, mallows, and similar plants; and a softening ointment should be applied repeatedly, well made with dulcamara; or a paste of marshmallow root mucilage mixed with egg white or ciram oil should be applied; or fat figs should be crushed with pigeon droppings and similar medicines used for softening and consolidation.
And sometimes it is resolved with persistent gentle rubbing using the hands, which should be moist, and the member should be moved in all directions at all times.
But if the twisted part has already gone too far and is strong and turned into stone, and it necessitates a cure with iron, then it should be cut open on the highest part of the bone, and the continuation of the bone should be dissolved. The superfluous matter that comes from that same condition should be cut away with fine scissors. And ease should be administered to him with solicitude and care.
Chapter 23.
On speech and dislocation.
Dislocation is the dislocation of one of its joints from its place, which is prohibited from movement, and it distorts the figure of the member, causing great pain and injury to the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs, it is necessary to immediately pierce and reduce it, and not delay that reduction, because if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed and hard with water, making the reduction of the dislocation difficult.
And for this reason, it is not advisable to move or stretch the affected area during the inflammation, as strong movements cause spasms and severe pain.
When this occurs, it is necessary that you perform phlebotomy on the patient, then let blood flow until the abscess is relieved; then wrap the limb with warm water and oil, and then reduce it gently.
And let every member be cured with the same water whose memory will return to its place.
And I have already ordered the chapters on dislocation according to what was mentioned earlier about fractures, from the highest part of the body down to the lowest part.
Chapter 24.
Of the cure for dislocation of the lower jaw.
When both jaws are dislocated and not too long ago; the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are moved from their places by a slight movement, and are made soft for a short time, or they are fully dislocated until they become soft at the joint, to the point that the patient drools and cannot hold it nor close his mouth, and his tongue is wrapped in his own words.
But when the dislocation is slight, it usually returns to its place by itself with little intervention.
But if the dislocation is complete and total, then it should be gently reduced immediately, without delay.
And let the assistant hold the head of the patient, while the doctor puts his thumb into the mouth on one side of the dislocated jaw, if it is dislocated on one side; or both thumbs together, if it is dislocated on both sides. The other fingers should be placed outside on the cheeks to balance; and instruct the patient to relax their jaw muscles and allow them to return to their original position; and the doctor balances the jaw and pushes it back until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated simultaneously, then administer an enema with hot water and oil until the reduction of both is easy, without delaying the reduction of both any longer, as we have said.
And then when they have returned and are balanced, and the patient's mouth is closed but not softened, then place a pad of cloth with wax over it, made of wax and rose oil; and then bind it gently with soft bandages.
The given text is a description of how to handle and position a patient experiencing pain in the joints, particularly in the feet, which has been attributed to cold humors by medieval medical practitioners. Here's the translation of your source sentence into English:
And this should be administered with ease, and without difficulty in the opening of the mouth for eating, drinking, and speaking until the jaw is healed and mended.
And if it is difficult to reduce two dislocated jaws that have not returned to their places, then very strong fevers and continuous sweating often occur, and the patient's stomach is swollen, and he vomits pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is a loss; and often he who experiences this dies within ten days.
Chapter .25
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the furcula and of the tip of the humerus.
The furcula is not dislocated from within the armpit by its connection to the feet; and sometimes it is dislocated to the outside part, which is evident by touch.
And its restoration is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms. Then press the area with your palm strongly, because it will return.
Then place a plaster and powder on that spot and strengthen it well.
Here's the translation of the given text:
And then place over it a plaster, and powders, and a bandage, and command the patient to maintain tranquility and rest until they are healed.
And with this same treatment, the end of the muscle is reduced when it has been separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of a dislocated muscle.
Know that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, of which one way is that it is dislocated from the little finger towards the ring finger.
And the second way is that it is dislocated at the top of the muscle, and this happens rarely; and it is not dislocated towards the back near the shoulder; and it is not dislocated towards the front near the nerves.
And it is most commonly dislocated and exits towards the ring finger next to the little finger, and this happens more easily in those with thin flesh; but in those with thick flesh, it comes out with difficulty.
And often this happens to some men through a blow or fall, and their muscle swells with an acute abscess, and it is believed that it has already been dislocated. ️
Adonc cove que tu sproes aquo entro que estias sobre-sertetut de lu, e lahoras processescas in la curacio de lu.
Certainly! Here is the translation of the provided text:
If it is a dislocation of the feet or higher up, and you then find clear evidence of this, and it is not hidden.
And from this dislocation, a gentle reduction can be made when it is fresh and the patient is a child.
And the reduction of it is that the assistant lifts the patient's hand to the parts above; and then places their fingers below the heel, and raises the joint with force back to its place, and the assistant lifts the patient's hand, and extends it upwards; and then places it down because it returns slightly.
But if by doing this it does not return, and from the beginning that the dislocation occurred, many days have passed, then it is necessary for the patient to be bathed in hot water and a poultice should be applied that softens and loosens as if it were made of althea, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be applied.
And then the patient should be laid on their back and placed below the heel a support of wool that is balanced between softness and firmness. And then the physician places his heel on the support, and raises the head of the muscle with all his strength, and pulls the patient's hand so that it is not drawn downwards, and another assistant holds the patient's head so that it is not drawn downwards, because this quickly returns to its place.
E si voles, reduzeys aquel segon aquesta manieyra: e es que tu fassas esser prezent un home le qual sia pus lonc que·l malaute, e estia de la part de aquel latz, e entrometa le sieu muscle dejos le titillic del malaute e eleve le titillic de lu a las partidas desus entro que·l malaute sia suspendut en ayre, e autre ministre tire la ma del malaute de las partidas dejos del sieu ventre. If the patient is light, then it's necessary that with him another cause is suspended, so that he becomes heavy, because the dislocation returns quickly.
And it is reduced in another way: and that is to place a long pole in the ground with its head round like a pestle, not too thick nor too thin, and then to place the patient underneath; after that, pieces of cloth are placed on top of the patient's head, and the patient stands according to the length of the pole, and then his hand is extended towards the opposite side, and his body is pulled strongly towards the other side, because the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if it is difficult to reduce him due to all the causes we have mentioned, then use this treatment: and that is to take a pole whose length is two arms long, and its width should be four fingers, and its thickness should be thinner at the top like this:
And then pieces of cloth are tied over the round head to prevent the pole from hurting the patient.
And then the patient is placed underneath the tip of the pole, and his hand or arm is extended over the pole towards the opposite side, and the pole is tied around the adjutories (assistants) and the arm and the extremity of the hand.
Here's my attempt at translating the given sentence:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And it is necessary that the patient's food be taken in small amounts until the member is comforted, for it is easier for him to heal.
And then the food should be given more frequently, about seven or five times, and exercise should be performed; and if it is firm and not softened, then it is healed.
But if the joint is dislocated many times due to moisture that happens to him or for another reason, then it is necessary that in that area a cautery with three holes be administered, as was said before in the chapter on cauteries.
And if all this is done and after seven days the bandage is removed and the joint is not firm, and the plaster and stricture are applied to it several times, and it is not firm and does not have a hold and cannot raise that arm to its former place, then know that his nerves, which are at the head of the muscle, are already cut or stretched or softened, and know that the joint will never be put back in its place.
Regarding the dislocation that occurs in the feet and the nipples or the parts behind them, the reduction is done with pressure and stretching with the hands until it returns.
"And let another stricture be administered to it, and cure it until it is healed.
"And if there is a delay in the healing of the member and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use warm baths until that heaviness is alleviated and it returns to its former nature.
Chapter 27
"On the treatment of shoulder dislocation.
"Know that the shoulder joint is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; it can be dislocated in all directions, but most commonly towards the front or the back. The dislocation of it is not hidden from you because it appears through swelling or deformity according to whatever shape it has been dislocated into. And when you set the dislocated shoulder with the hand, this is evident to you, for the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm, nor can it touch its own muscle.
"And it is necessary that you cut and reduce the dislocation as soon as possible before it reaches the acute stage, for if it reaches the acute stage, reduction of it will be difficult, and healing will not be complete; especially when it is in the posterior direction, because this is the worst of all other types of dislocations, with more pain, and many have died from it.
Here's the translation of the given text:
"But if the dislocation is in the front part, then return it by bending the hand with its own hand, until you feel the elbow touch the base of your palm.
"And if the dislocation does not obey the reduction, then apply strong extension and great force.
"And it is that two assistants should extend the arm, and hold it in this way with two assistants so that it does not move during the extension.
"And then the arm should be turned in all directions, since it is wrapped with a long folded cloth around the hand of the patient, or a bandage.
"And when the physician touches the joint with their hand, anoint it with some oil so that this assists in the lubrication of the joint for ease; and then forcefully push on the joint until it returns.
"And then the reduction of it requires that a poultice be placed on it which has been made with astringents and exsiccatives with egg white, and it should be bound tightly downwards, and the arm should be suspended from the neck, and it should be left for several days.
"And then it should be unbound; and if the joint is formed in its place, then you unbind the bandage from it and leave it like that.
And if you notice that the joint is not strengthened, then you should reapply the plaster and the bandage, and leave it for several days until it becomes strengthened; and then remove it.
But if there is gravity near the reduction of the joint and the condition is in movement, then administer moistening with a bath and subtle friction, as well as compression, until it is relieved; or place over the joint a cushion made of thick wool; and then bind it, leaving it on the bones day and night. Then remove that, and place him in a bath; and when he comes out, then you should rub the joint with temperate friction, and then apply over it a cushion made of wool, three times, once after the first time, and once after the second. in the medium of the bath, until it is healed.
And if you wish, place over it a wet and scraped cowhide border strengthened with leather; and do this several times, because that is moist and reduces the swelling.
Chapter 28.
About the treatment of dislocation in the shoulder joint, which is between the arm and the hand.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And the reduction of the dislocation is that you place the patient's hand on a table and instruct them to extend their hand, while the doctor places their hand or palm over the prominence of the joint, and presses it until it returns to its proper place.
However, it is important to consider if the palm of the hand has already been removed from the hand, then the patient should place the back of their hand on a table with extension and reduction; and if the dislocation precedes the back of the hand, then the position of the patient's hand should be intrinsically on the table, so that the doctor's hand falls upon that prominence of the joint.
Therefore, if it returns immediately, that is good; and if not, then strengthen it with a poultice to reduce the swelling and leave it; and do not repeat this, because otherwise it will not tolerate or be able to endure the reduction of pus that passes throughout the day.
However, the joint will remain according to its twisted condition; and do not tell the patient any reason for this, except that their hand is softened and cannot strengthen in any way; then you should know that the nerves are pinched or torn, and at that time it is not beneficial to strengthen it with a cautery, but rather apply something soothing.
When the illness has returned, then place upon the patient an ointment which we have recommended, and let it be left and strengthened for five days; and then let it be unbound and let the hand of the patient be exercised.
But if the patient's movement is hindered and some gravity occurs in them, then relieve it with hot water and some friction several times, until they are relieved.
Chapter 29
Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the fingers.
Sometimes the fingers are dislocated completely.
And when one of those fingers is dislocated at the back of the palm or on its underside, then straighten the finger and press the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns to its proper place.
And then support the head of the finger, and suspend that part from which it was dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Then suspend it and extend it until it is straight on the same day.
And at night, bind it according to that method, and do not cease to unbind it during the day and exercise with movement, and bind it at night; and do this for some days until it is straight.
And act as if with water, if the hand is dislocated in the belly, and connect it to that part and perform the first operation with water until it is healed.
And similarly, act with water when it is dislocated in other parts.
Chapter .xxx.
On the treatment of dislocation of the spine in the back.
When a complete dislocation occurs in one of the vertebrae of the back or neck, and many vertebrae are moved from their places, then there is no cure for it, because death comes to the patient.
And the sign of this is that the patient's excretion goes out involuntarily and cannot be retained; and often some members are weakened, or both legs, or both arms, or one of these; or a vertebra is moved from its place, because often it is moved and often the removal of those [vertebrae] occurs in four parts.
Therefore, that [condition] has already been removed to the rear parts and is called palsy.
However, the cure for it is that you should consider whether the palsy occurs in infancy, because then there is no cure and no hope of a complete recovery.
Certainly! Let's break down the text into smaller parts and translate it line by line:
"And of those [cases], only the one that occurs on the back of the foot is cured with what I recommend.
"And let the patient be placed on their back close to a wall, and let them be covered with a wet cloth so that their feet are not exposed.
"And then place a straight stick in the ground at the head of the patient, and another stick under their feet at the opposite end of the bed.
"And one attendant should hold the stick, without it being fixed in a hole; and another attendant should hold the other stick in the same manner.
"And then wrap a bandage around the patient's head and tie it firmly below their ears; extend the end of the bandage to the stick that is behind their head, and tie it there; then place another bandage over their ankles and pass it between their legs, above their knees; then adjust all the bandages and tie them to the other stick that is under their feet.
It seems like the text is discussing a medical procedure involving a "fust" or pole, and ensuring that the poles and ligaments are not moved from their original positions but also are not secured as previously mentioned. Here's a line-by-line translation:
And the doctor places his palms on the spine with strength until it returns to normal or he places his hands on a table, and then adjusts his feet on the table until it returns to normal.
But if it does not return with this method, then take a table whose length or width is approximately three arms' lengths, and in the wall where we mentioned it should be near the patient, carve out a space in which to insert the end of the table. And then place the middle of the table on the spine, and the doctor places his feet on the other end of the table, and pulls firmly until the spine is straightened and returns to its place.
And if you wish, open with a lever that is turned by hand; and it should be done on the ground behind the patient's head with two posts, the length of which should be an arm's length, and also place the patient's head between two posts; and the distance between each post should be one palm width, and in each post a hole should be made in which a pulley can run, and each one should be firmly secured to the ground so that it does not move.
And there should also be a round post in which the pulley is placed, and it should be turned in the holes of the two posts.
And at the end of it is a hole in which the rod is formed, and its length is one palm with the part that is turned; and in the other two rods it is similar to this one.
Then strengthen the bands that you have tightly tied around the feet of the patient in the hole that is towards their head, and the bands that you have tied around their hips in the turn that is towards their feet.
Then there should be one servant for each turn to twist the turn with his hand, and the doctor should straighten the spine as we have said.
And then, after the spine has been returned to its place and the area has been straightened, it is necessary to place a drying plaster with egg white on it, and then wool; and then place a board over the plaster, whose width should be three fingers or about that, and whose length should be enough to cover the swelling of the spine.
Then it should be bound with the band we mentioned earlier, and the patient should be fed only light food until he is healed.
And if there remains any swelling in the place after healing, then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and cleanse with long-term administration of the diet we have recommended; and a lead plate has already been applied to that place.
And sometimes there is an indication at the end of the spine of the back, and it is thought to be caused by this dislocation; and it is that bone which already threatens because it should not be approached with this medicine, for it will make you encounter death.
Chapter 31.
The treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the joint of the hip and the joint of the thigh should only be considered as dislocations, and not what happens to other joints with slight separation and concavity.
And the hip joint can be dislocated in four ways: either towards the inside parts, or towards the outside parts, or towards the front parts, or towards the back parts.
And it is most commonly dislocated towards the inside parts, and rarely towards the front or the back parts.
And the sign of its dislocation towards the inside parts is that, when you straighten the healthy thigh of the patient with the sick one, it is longer and the knee is more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend his foot inward, and it is the place where the swelling occurs, a swelling full of pus, because the head of the bone has already reached here.
The sign of one in whom dislocation occurs is that the parts go outwards; this is because the accidents of him are contrary to this accident.
The sign of one in whom dislocation occurs to the front parts is that he extends his leg according to its shape, but it does not bend without pain where it hurts. And if he tries to go forward and cannot do so towards the front parts; his urine is retained and his groin is swollen, and you should make him walk on his sole.
The sign of one in whom dislocation occurs to the back parts is that he does not extend his leg, nor can he bend it as much as he can bend his groin, and his leg is shorter than the other, and his groin is softened, and the head of the thigh should be placed in that location.
However, the reduction of the different types of this dislocation is that you should consider whether the dislocation is old and ancient, which has already been established with him. Then you administer the reduction to him according to his condition, in which case the cure does not consist entirely of that; and therefore it is not necessary for him to be promptly treated in that manner.
Here's the translation of the given text:
Here's my attempt to translate the given sentence:
And it is an extension of him or of the part from within to the corner near the fork, or from behind to the back.
And it should be the extension of all those [servants/assistants] at once, until the patient is lifted off the ground with his body and remains suspended.
And this type of extension is common to all four [limbs or extremities].
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then all kinds of things must be done for the proper treatment.
In the reduction of himself, when he is dislocated and the dislocation is in the internal parts, it is necessary that the patient be placed on his back; and then place the ligaments over the lower part of the thigh at the point between the head of the thigh and the place below the knee; and then extend the ligament above the corner to the highest part of the fork.
And then another strong minister should take the arms of him and firmly grasp the thick part of the sick thigh and extend it outward with great force, for that returns to its place.
And this treatment is one of the lightest cures with which this limb can be reduced, compared to other treatments.
But if you are excused and do not obey the instructions for this cure completely, then it is necessary to bind both feet of the patient together with a strong but light bandage over both the heels and both the soles.
And let the length of each [bandage] be by a count of four fingers, and let the sick leg be extended more than the other by a count of two fingers.
And then the patient should be suspended over the top of a beam, and he should be inverted; and let the length of him from the ground be the count of two arms' lengths.
And then command a strong youth to lower the head of the bed, and let another youth be suspended with the patient, and this other youth should raise the bed with strength, because the joint returns to its place quickly.
But in the proper reduction, when it is a dislocation on the outward side, it is necessary that the patient lie on his belly as we have recommended after they have been bandaged; and let the bandage be strengthened especially over the sick leg and over his feet.
And then two poles should be placed, one under the patient's feet and the other under their head; and then, poles adjusted in the middle of the bed should be placed on which wet cloths are wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed by the pole being between their thighs, in order to ensure that the extension towards the lower parts is not pulled.
"And then each assistant should extend [their hand] to their part, and the doctor with his hand guides the reduction according to the art.
"And when the dislocation is at the front joints, then the leg should be slightly extended and according to this same account placed on a support; and the doctor places the palm of his right hand over the patient's elbow, and then straightens it with the other hand, and with that straightening places it extended behind the front joint.
"And if the dislocation is at the back joints, then it is not necessary for the patient to be extended behind, and should be raised above the ground; however, it is necessary that they be placed on a hard surface, as is appropriate for elevation if their ankle is dislocated outward, as we have said about placing them on two ankles; and their face should be down and the limbs extended, as we have mentioned, there is no need to do much more.
And it is necessary that a compression be applied with a board over the area where there is joint pain.
Therefore, when the reduction is completed as needed — and the sign of reduction is not hidden from you, which is that you extend the patient's two legs, and when you see those toes and the patient draws back their leg and spreads it without hesitation, then you know that the member has returned as needed — at this point, you adjust two cushions, apply a poultice and bind with bandages in such a way that the width is not increased on any side; and keep the patient resting for three days or four.
Then remove the bandage and the poultice, and compare one leg with the other.
At this point, if you see those toes in order, then you know that the dislocation has already been fixed, and therefore let the patient go.
And if you see any sign of swelling, then return and apply a poultice to it, and draw it according to your first bandage, and let it remain for three days.
Then remove that, and make the patient walk with crutches on each side for several days, until they are comfortable.
It appears that you've provided the chapter number (Capitol .xxxii) rather than a specific line of text from the medieval medical treatise. Please provide the full text or lines you would like translated into English, and I will be happy to assist you with that.
Of the treatment for dislocation of the shoulder.
The shoulder is dislocated in three ways: it is dislocated to the outside parts, and to the inside parts, and more often to the back parts; it is not dislocated to the front parts.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the patient to apply their leg to their hip; then you know that the shoulder is dislocated.
And the restoration of all its ways is that you make the patient lie down straight, so that they can extend their leg if possible; attach your hand to his face, and place his foot between your feet; then make the shoulder adhere with your palms, and hold these above the patient's shoulder with strength, and another servant extends his foot until the shoulder returns to its place.
The sign of its reduction is that the leg adheres to the hip with ease and without effort.
And then bandage that and make the leg adhere to the hip, and then bind both together at the same time with a bandage for three days or four, and then unbind them.
And do not let the patient walk for some days until they are healed and comforted.
But if the reduction of him to you is unsuccessful, then administer strong extension with the ligaments which in the treatment of the hip were previously mentioned.
Chapter 33.
Of the treatment of the dislocation of the ankle.
The ankle sometimes is subluxated by slight movement, and sometimes it is dislocated according to the direction, and the dislocation of it is done either towards the inside or the outside parts.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you will see the ankle swollen in the direction to which it has been dislocated.
But the treatment of its subluxation is an easy reduction, and it is that it be extended gently with the hands and be wrapped until it returns.
But in its treatment when it is dislocated according to the direction, it is necessary that you make the patient lie straight, and let him have a strong and valiant servant behind his back in the middle of him.
And then you take with your right hand the foot from the higher part, and with your left hand the part below the foot in the place of the ankle.
And now draw the foot towards you with your right hand, and then twice with the left, and then extend it with the left; and place the heel of the foot against the right side of the thigh without any effort.
And do this twice as we have described.
Then place the heel of the foot against the thigh for the third time, and you are at the ankle.
Therefore, if it returns in one or two times according to this method, and you see the foot swollen, it is good; and otherwise, continue the operation on it, because that returns.
But if it is forbidden to reduce it with what we have recommended, then make the patient lie on their back on the ground, and fix a strong stake in the ground, which should be placed between their thighs, and you have already wrapped cloth around it so that the patient does not get hurt.
Then let one of his attendants hold the patient's thighs, and then another attendant extend the foot with their hands or with a bandage that lies over the top of the foot; and then each attendant should stretch against the resistance of their fellow, and the stake should remain between the patient's thighs, holding it so that the body is not pulled towards the parts below its extension.
And the doctor then manipulates the dislocation with his own hands, while another assistant holds the healthy part below, for the dislocation returns easily.
And so when the dislocation returns and its healing is declared to you, then place a plaster and secure it firmly with strong bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with a bandage.
And you should be careful or take care of the nerves that are behind the ankle, so that the bandage on it is not too tight and does not press them firmly.
And then leave it like this for two days or three; and if the bandage is softened, remove it.
And then unbind it on the third day or the fourth, and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. But if he is forced to walk during that time, it is not certain that the dislocation will not be dissolved and corrupted in him, and then he will not receive cure.
And if an abscess should occur, then you must administer to him the treatment that we have previously described in another place of care and poultice application, until it is removed.
Based on the context provided in the previous sentences, "Capitol .xxxiiii." likely translates to:
"On the treatment of dislocation of the toes.
"Ensure that the dislocated [toe] is wrapped with minimal extension and without exertion; for this is not difficult, rather it is easier.
"But if the dislocation is in one of the toes at the back of the foot, then you should make the patient sit on a pile of grass or on a table, and have them stand as if walking.
"And then you should stand on the foot, and place your foot on what is above the joints, and then press with your foot with all your might until it returns, and ensure that it is wrapped and no prominence appears.
"And then place beneath the sole of the patient's foot a board that takes the entire foot, which has two handles, and secure it with a proper and firm binding for three days; and then release it and make the patient rest from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and recovery is assured.
"Chapter XXXV.
"On the types of dislocation that occur with wound, or with fracture, or with both together.
"When any of these occur, and you undertake the treatment and restoration [of the patient], many times death ensues.
This sentence is discussing the qualities of a physician who should treat this condition. Here's a line-by-line translation: And then you should immediately work to reduce it at the onset of the cause before it becomes a dangerous abscess.
And then if the member returns as we wish, administer a regimen that prevents dangerous abscesses and treat the wound with water from desiccating ointments.
And if the dislocation is accompanied by a fracture and occurs in the small bones, then you perforate their ends, and do as we said earlier for simple illnesses with water in those places.
And keep and avoid according to your ability that which comes through the ways of fear as I have predicted before; for this is better for you from your Creator, and more permanent for your glory, and healthier for your true body at all times. Thus ends the words of Albucasis, may God be praised. Amen.
