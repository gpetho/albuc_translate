CHAPTER THIRTEEN.	Chapter XIII.	0.69006693
On entropion occurring in the upper eyelid. The eye that suffers this inversion of the lid is called 'leporine' (i.e. hareeye).	When this Alxatrati occurs in the eye, it is called Leporina.	0.62691206
Now sometimes this inversion is natural, sometimes acquired.	And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.	0.4968459
It is acquired either from the cicatrization of an injury, or an incision, or cauterization, or the like.	Accidental, then, results from the healing of a wound, or a cut, or cautery, and similar things.	0.73316056
The idea of the operation is to excise the scar, separate the edges of the wound, pack linen between them, and bandage up till healed.	And the procedure for it is to split that healed area, separate its edges, and place between them a small strip of linen, and bind it until it heals.	0.7292634
In the treatment of it you should not use anything styptic or drying, for if you do the inversion will return worse than ever before. Employ relaxing substances such as fenugreek; and fomentation with water in which mallows and linseed have been boiled; and diachylon plaster which has been previously softened with one of the oils and spread on the packs; and treat it with this.	And it is not necessary to use drying and constricting substances in its treatment: for if you do so, the Alxatrati will return worse than it was: rather, use softening agents, such as fenugreek: and bathe with water in which althea and flaxseed have been cooked: and dyaquilon ointment, melted with some oil: and wrap with linen, and treat with it.	0.82314086
The main thing in the treatment is to use every device to prevent the healing up of the place as it was before.	And the treasure of your treatment is to strive by every skill to ensure it does not heal in the form it was at first.	0.667364
This operation which we have described is but some correction of the inversion, not that the appearance of the place will necessarily revert to what it was.	And indeed, this procedure we have described is only a kind of correction of Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not return exactly as it was.	0.6327117
