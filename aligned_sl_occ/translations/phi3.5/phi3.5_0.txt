Oh children, you have completed this book before me, the last of medical science'dictions, due to your mastery over it as evidenced by how quickly and effectively you learn from what I present; through my lectures, explanations, and declarations, I see that you understand thoroughly this subject matter which is apart from surgery.
When the operation is exhausted in our region and at all times, as long as I observe you (the patient), until only small descriptions remain from Ancient texts, which I change into these errors and ignorance; they are closed off by my understanding of it, thus lengthening its force and art.

And another doctor ordered that the patient swallow a stone from within which had progressed in its state, and this stone was large; it was drawn out through one of the bladders, so that by the third day, the internal substance died inside the urinary bladder.
And you have already called for it to be removed there, and because of the greatness of the stone and due consideration given by the abdomen's position beneath her that she will die.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And another doctor takes pay from our lord of this land for surgery, and brings with him a black instrument which was used by someone else due to his fracture in the thigh; thus prepares the doctor based on ignorance, extracts the fracture onto soft materials like pillows and beds, without letting air escape into these.
Here you return the ligaments according to your wishes, and secure them in place with pins during rest days and command that we remove the stitches; at this time, the thigh and buttocks will form an opening (perforation).
And it is called him (referred to as 'lu'), and his apparatus was used for untying the ligature, achieving calmness and relief from their pains.
Indeed at that time there was confirmed decay in the limb, so it could not be restrained and did not stop moving within while the malady persisted.
And another doctor pierced an abscess, and it became ulcerated for several days until its wickedness was clear to them lord of the patient.
The cause is that the head was treated for yellow bile (choler), and it does not affect them entirely but rather the member where they have been hosted since then.
For water (or humor), children, it is necessary for you that the operation be planned in two parts: one associated with health and another where there are greater dangers involved.

So it is said that the speech of cautery and its nonessential (perhaps meaning unnecessary or irrelevant) are long and elaborate, subtle by science, with hidden motives; they argue much about fine points and disagree among themselves, which for me suffices as a brief part of their discussions.
And it is said that the pointed cautery comforts all of the body universally, except for two kinds of its matter, which are tail matters.
In the complexity of a dry and dehydrated body; they find that warmth pleases one therapy for it, while others prefer its contrary, as this is suitable in both quality and dryness, where nature itself is such—wherefore necessity dictates pouring water into what's dried out and then heating up the same to cure.

Through the speech of that person, I have discovered some things for myself at times.
May nevertheless he who comes after expels that which has already been drained out and exercised in the place of cauterization for today's practice, understanding both the complexity of human composition and the disposition of diseases within their bodies, as well as the causes of those ailments and accidents, along with the time span of these conditions.
May occur in other complexities as well, not out of fear, but mainly due to excessive humors and moist conditions; all doctors agree on this matter, without concern for the strength required for cauterization in these situations.
And as for those who understand the secret of healing with fire and know their patient well, they use medical cautery on this point only, which reaches the part that has been cauterized but does not affect the other parts of the body unless minor harm is done to them.
May the medicine burn reach him in those parts where he was laid low, and forcefully bring about recovery of that ill body which is difficult to cure and forces its way out.
May the fire (or heat), due to its sublimity and good substance, does not cause harm unless in excess; we have come to know this through experimentation and long study of service towards mastering art on truth about causes; therefore you are excused for lengthy discourse here as I secretly manipulate the focus, aimed at expelling illnesses from their courses.

So don't put pressure on your feet or knees, for ordinary people and doctors consider them as the cause of this illness that is treated with cautery but not completely eradicated; thus they impose rest periods to deal with these consequences.
The cause is not due to what they eat and drink (water), for the treatments are only in places of medicine that alter the constitution and dry up the humours, which are causes why pains come about.
Even if it is necessary for points beyond what medicine typically requires, due to the patient'sin health and strength of work executed by their lord/master, use additional cautery accordingly.

This cauterization conveys moisture and coldness to the accident that is causing it; its cause is a lot of fluid discharge from headaches down limbs' joints and fingers, prolonged sleeping periods, dental pain, gout throughout illnesses characterized by chilliness due to fluid accumulation or paralysis-apoplexy, as well as resemblance in these maladies.
The form of this cauterization is as follows: firstly command the humors to be expelled through medicine-cleansing actions for three or four nights, depending on the discharge rate of the humor and the patient'se age and habits.

When in the whole head there is chronic and long-lasting pain, and it resides within the spleen extended for a while, using knives and cupping glasses as well as lancing needles and scrapings of mercury or lead (which were believed to be implicated), with hands holding these tools—if any cautery has already been applied on such areas without further investigation into their causes; moreover, if the spleen's nature is characterized by significant heavy metal content in its constitution; it does not constitute excessive harm and abomination (as they would perceive), hence why another caustic tool should be used immediately for treatment. Return that over the head of your neck with caustic inside while cutting the tendon. Cut the ribcage and expose its thickness as we have recorded and will cauterize that portion in the lower part of the chest where it is being applied, which is also the location for applying a bellows (ventouse). And lift your hand so high that you do not discover the bones, for when humors have attacked them severely and caused great pain different from pains treated by other caulters of the head.

When arthritic joint pain becomes persistent or when the ache enters into the groin area, let physicians administer immediate care for these conditions; and here two kinds of surgical intervention are mentioned: cauterization as provided by acute medicine burns treatment, or with iron. This means that there were believed to be specific treatments involving heat application from a burning agent in traditional medical practices (acute comburent) alongside the use of metal tools for this purpose – likely hot irons used on wounds and lesions following an infectious outbreak within maladies, which required immediate attention.
May healers use medicine as a means of incineration and take that piece out along with both the hands of your patient.

According to this method, the practice of cauterization involves using fire as follows for treatment (implying there's a specific technique being referred to): The use of heated substances or instruments is indicated here.

And it is called "claus clavilhs," where the head of your instrument takes on a shape similar to that of a key (likely referring to an actual physical implement used in treatments), and at this spot, you insert or press into place something small for assistance – possibly indicating another tool's purpose within their practice. Here 'es apelat claus clavilhs' could mean the name given by physicians or practitioners of these ancient times to a particular device used in treatments involving
Then place your hand over the location of pain – ensuring that you prevent harm from coming to those joints (likely referring back, as in cauterization or other forms of hands-on treatment) which could be at risk due to conditions like arthritis ('la qual es dejos'), and slowly rotate a small tool — perhaps indicative of another instrument used for this purpose.

Here I have translated to convey a traditional approach involving the use of common kitchen items like garlic, as well as symbolic or ritualistic elements such as onion worm heads ("auriga") for their purported healing properties in treating gastrointestinally related issues during medieval times—a reflection possibly indicative of folk medicine practices. The reference to kissing the lips together is a metaphorical way indicating closing or seal, which might symbolize finalizing treatment with an act believed by some traditions (perhaps spiritual) as healing in

From the provided fragment, we can infer that this line is likely referring to an ancient medical practice involving eye care (pertaining to 'cauterize' or cauterizing), where it mentions applying force with fingers ("puncho") on a patient when their hairs have turned into parts of instruments. However,
When the patient's hair turns into parts of instruments and I need to puncture or apply medicine burn in those areas (based on interpretation), it is done with two hands either for incision ("cauteria") or applying a healing concoction by fire, according to these dual methods. This translation attempts to convey the idea that when hairs transform into parts used during surgery and requires intervention using fingers ('pungo'), there are alternative procedures—either cutting (incision) with hands in two positions ("quar cauteria") or applying medicinal solutions prepared by
If I need to cauterize with my hand ('cauteria'), command the humors in that individual, directing them such that their hairs come alongside those which are for washing; and if a finger is used instead of puncturing (“punho”), tightly wrap around it with bandages so as not to enter into these newly emerged threads ('nacsutz'). Herein lies the directive: first, cleanse by introducing appropriate humors. If one opts for incision using fingers rather than cauterization and removes any remaining hair (“lol naysement”), tightly secure with bandages such that no unwanted materials penetrate these fresh threads of body matter. This translation interprets a set of steps likely from an ancient medical text, suggesting treatment procedures involving the direct application or removal related to bodily fluids and filaments for healing purposes using hands and possibly external interventions like cautery with substances (often implied in historical texts). The language bl

When treating a fistula that has been discussed in the divisions of diseases and without administers your treatment, you would then cauterize it following this method: command the malady to cease its efforts within itself (i.e., stop bleeding internally), hold onto any medicine between one's thighs with hands tightly gripped in such a manner that neither moisture nor restlessness occurs at their head, thus avoiding further aggravation or worsening of the condition while attempting to heal it.
Return your hand pressure or warmth in an oil blend, or soft padding made from wool over the body of him/her.

Return (or close) the fistula if it is opened, and with this remove from there all that sickness and filth within it. If it is not unbound (or released), then work on that and extract the prolapsed part from there.
Return the burning instrument to you and hold it in your hand that there is not a doubt between yourself or the patient's chest about where this tool belongs, so when applying pressure on the area of the inflamed intestine (or hernia), place small amounts at intervals using these instruments. Here is the translation line by line:
And if the caustic enters into the mouth and goes down to the bone, do so; but otherwise repeat the application of the caustic once or twice a week according to customary practice, leaving it there for three days, then rest over that spot with bordering bandages and send in liniments exsudated within while healing.

Apply therein the applied flame-cauterizing tool (appropriate quantity needed in the fissure) so that molten metal from it reaches the root of such lesions, and then place your hand inside until its heat permeates to where this burning element has descended into or below these areas. Continue doing so for either one day or two days; apply within those timeframes also care as previously indicated in our instructions (healing measures), enszyme-like substances that have been recommended by us, and maintain until the healed state is achieved without further complications.

Cauterization of tooth pain": This refers to the medical practice of using heat or a caustic
When tooth pain is due to inflammation or infection, and the treatment does not comfort medicine, then caustic intervention at two places may be employed for healing": This sentence suggests that when a dental issue causes significant discomfort and conventional medical approaches fail to provide relief, alternative cauterization methods might be applied. These could involve using hot irons (like those used historically on large cattle horns) or focusing the heat directly where needed in order to alleviate pain through controlled burning of inflamed tissues as a treatment method within this medieval medical context.
Caustic application at the horn' extrusion is that you use the edges of cowhorns and sear them in heated metal hereby covering its extremity, as well as immersing what has been scorched from these bounds into heat so it may rest on top of the painful tooth within which burning occurs": Here, medieval medical practitioner describes a technique for using caustic substances derived from cow horns—searing them in metal and then applying this material directly over an extremity (presumably part of some dental or facial instrument) that is resting on the painful tooth. The aim seems to be not only immediate relief through direct contact with a burning agent but also possibly by embedding these scorched horn pieces into heat, which might serve as continuous localized treatment against inflammation within an abscess-like

Even though you are cauterizing the focus on the patient'thy thigh or iron, as long as there is any abscess and/or inflammation in their chest cavity that does not reach the mouth of the malady (presumably referring to an opening where fluids might drain out), continue with caution.
Return the cautery to its shape, and place it on your teeth so that the cautery becomes heated; this will provide some relief when the pain is severe or during that day or the next day.
When that tool used by the malady spreads its jaws and holds your tongue for an hour, this is how it functions as a cauterium (cauterization instrument).

Hold a burning spit between both hands on each side of what needs to be treated – typically an abscess or similar condition that requires direct heat application and intermittent contact for healing, as the flame is applied alternately (and briefly), allowing time in between applications so new blood can reach the previously coo0led area. If necessary within this treatment process, enter where there remains a wound to continue applying warmth until it fully clears – following these steps ensures that you are heating and possibly disinfecting without causing further harm or igniting surrounding healthy tissues unnecessarily.
If the ulcer is small, pause the application of the cautery according to the size of the ulcer; apply it for three days and rest over the heated area until such time that what has been ignited by the focus has burnt out.

These burn wounds are made according to their shape as preceded by earlier practices, indicating a methodical approach tailored to specific anatomical sites for treatment of respiratory conditions during medieval times:
If you wish, your cautery points will be the same as those which are called for pain in arthritis (of joints), whereby these forms come before when puncturing for this purpose.

If the pain extends into the hip or groin area, place a statue in there that contains water as it is formed within the abdomen (belly). This suggests applying cold compresses made with liquids such as water for localized inflammation and discomfort associated with gout. The medieval approach here seems to involve using colder substances like wax or ice, conceptually similar in purpose but not exactly aligned with modern medical practices which favor cooling methods without invasive
This is the method of applying water as a remedy (or treatment), and I have already written about it in the treatise on medical correction/diagnosis restoration techniques, implying that this approach to using cold substances like wax for gout pain was recognized within their documented practices. It underscores how even back then there were structured approaches—even Mix baking soda and vinegar in equal parts of one portion has been divided into two or more compartments; place the separated divisions back together until a new phase forms wherein previously joined portions have perforated due to internal pressure, depending on how much is placed inside. This medieval recipe likely refers to an age-old experiment using baking soda (alkali) and vinegar (acid), which reacts chemically when combined in water—producing carbon dioxide gas that can cause the "perforated" or separated divisions of a container, like two glass jars connected by their lids
Pause after the formation of another phase in which water (from internal pressure) rises and divides into two parts, place wet baking soda and vinegar on top—this rising or "fountain" action draws up these substances as if by a suction. Then use those collected for good compression treatment; apply the hand that yields this water quickly from underneath to where it previously divided above in order not to let any more come out, indicating an attempt at containing and possibly soothing inflamed joint areas associated with gout through manual pressure using natural concoctions made of baking soda (alkali) mixed with vinegar. This method aligns somewhat traditionally—before the widespread use of modern anti-inflammatory drugs, people often used physical methods to manage inflammation and pain from conditions like gout.

Some pains occur in two places due to various causes such as hunting or being struck by an object, and for reasons similar to those (the context is not clear without the full text), through the infusion of moist substances with putrefied materials. Here's a possible interpretation: The pain might be happening at two different locations because these are either from activities like pursuing game or being hit by something, as well as for reasons that seem similar to those cases (perhaps related to impurities), and the treatment could involve infusing moisture mixed with decayed matter.
And with this very specific type of puncture, which is caused by effusion of humoral fluid, we will not make cuts but instead use cautery here only for treatment purposes.
So then, for the evacuation of the malady through pill-stuffed and resembling vessels that are three lines according to its course, place a cauter in any one line with as much force as they tolerate from both the malady'dictions within them and their vitality.

From the context of these lines, it appears that this is about treatment for gout and joint pain:
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
So when gout is cured as a result of the doctor'sin treatment and there are no more pains remaining, then apply bandages without delay.
When you are cauterizing that which is expelled within the joint passage of the foot and thigh, with your cautery instruments.
That is the form of this instrument: (here referring to a pointed heated tool used for medical purposes)
If it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then use a pointed cautery for that purpose. If pain enters the joints or other connections, and motion disturbs them, then you must cauterize that area with three or four of these cauters throughout the entire body for this specific purpose.
If you need to use caustics and these are necessary for you, then apply them only where they are needed without pressing too hard with your hand on the tool previously used; do this solely by inserting a small piece of sponge into the catheter beforehand.
If pain enters between them and both legs, then apply the previously mentioned cautery as directed in our chapter.
If the pain is only in the feet and it calls for sweat (indicating inflammation or fever), then a piercing occurs along the meridians where circulation happens; this involves making points on those two lines.
If there remain pains in the fingers or thumbs, then make a point on the circumference of each joint over every knuckle and the pad of the palm; this is where they hold their hands.
If joint or muscle pain occurs during the days in hips or legs, then you will cauterize all parts of assistants' bodies.

And sometimes heavy wounds require strong caution for healing, and lightly if the species of leprosy is due to decomposition of fat and melancholy." (Here it suggests a treatment method where severe injuries might need more robust therapeutic approaches while less serious cases possibly linked with psychological factors like 'melancholy' require milder interventions. The connection between the condition, leprosy in this case, is made through historical belief linking mental states and physical health outcomes.)
Therefore, when you intend to caustically treat that one, consider if the leprosy is mixed and what has been previously mentioned for healing as part of division—and not here nor there; and worry about corruption affecting the entire body and complexity alike. In this case, apply it atop the head with cauterization: on top where hair meets skin (at or behind the skull), between two folds of flesh below [which may refer to underarm regions], over both shoulders; each above a joint—on one shoulder's pus and its counterpart beneath. And also, apply it at back relative to neck or sinews: on top where skin meets bone." (This detailed instruction outlines the precise locations for applying cauterization as part of leprosy treatment in medieval times according to their understanding—focusing not just on isolated areas but considering systemic health. The treatments are tailored based on specific body parts and joint types, showing a targeted approach consistent with medical practices from that era.)

This line further elaborates on the physician's observations post-cauterization—specifically that parts treated with heat (likely referring to thermal cauterization) have been observed for potential healing or complications like an open wound ("ulcerat"). The phrase reflects a common medieval medical concern where physical signs were critical in diagnosing and planning
It is noted that the part has been previously burned in a circular area within this location (am circuito), either with pointed instruments ("motze") or through other means of heat application like bellows-induced flame for cauterization, which they might have applied here.

Thus if you encounter the decay in its location where caustic has been applied at the focal point (the focus of treatment), then apply cauterization with small pieces of wood, and large ones as necessary for that specific site where there is rot to eradpective.

In addressing the ulcers and diseases of certain body parts (referring to joints in this context), which call for medical attention due to their severe cause: invasion or excessive fluid, leading these conditions downward onto the limbs; here two types of cauterization are employed—one applied directly on fire at crucial points affecting feet and another involving water used as a therapeutic agent.

Wrap your hand tightly around it (apply compression), turning continuously until all is absorbed into your skin and the edge of the needle settles in the groove of the bolt already present on its own, effectively stopping further influx of fluid due to the puncture wound caused by a small amount of remaining water. Wait for about an hour (until after the malaute or effusion subsides with this minimal intervention), and then remove that pressure along with any residual blood flow resulting from it.
And if it is necessary for them inside, place their other within where they enter the body through those parts of the limb.

If you wish, cauterize that which has been previously done with a pointed instrument within the mouth and keep it at the location where that particular surgery was performed.

Cover the area where old arthritis has formed in the joints with an extract that is applied gently on top, and have a cushion placed there for comfort; apply medicine according to your prescriptions so as not to harm the flesh or bones within until they heal.
While you work elsewhere during another visit or event, then take measures to contract that fluid from the arteries, either by using a compression device (catheter) or where it enters into its fistula/port site; tighten your grip so as to restrict that flow. If a cause of those is not before you now, then pause over the spot where his sanction has contracted, and bring on the fiery heat within it until contraction ceases, and when he strengthens again, so too should your string tighten accordingly.
When you place a caustic outside the artery for which you have already two locations to try and test them out, holding it until they reach the bones, so that when it is between your limbs, it cannot be consolidated by anything from this cauterization.

The treatment of sharp and acute pain in the joints caused by cold humors within the body, as per traditional medical practices described here:
When the acid is stored within those veins that are above the patient's chest and causes no discomfort in any way for medical treatment, their back may become reddened as if they were carrying ants while walking, and their hair stands on end due to moisture from tears; ancient healers use this method of operation, thereby completing that form of care.
You command the malady to draw out the hairs on their face, and you insert them into three incisions made at the mouth according to the length of the forehead. If the length of the fissure is two fingers: one finger away from the nose's midline in the forehead area where tears are produced, and another a little distance according to the movement of those eyes which produce tears, then this refers to three parts.
Guard your jaw from the onset of teeth grinding that are positioned at two angles and extend your neck to continue both upper jaws. If in any joint there is three times its size adjusted or expanded, then it means that an excessive amount of fluid has accumulated within the space of one articulation due to imbalance or blockage of humors.

This highlights medieval doctors' concern for not only physical but also spiritual well-being, as they saw the body and its maladies interconnected with overall health Remove from this padding and insert into the first joint another tool (possibly a splint or different kind of padded device), which is intended to be used cuttingly on one end while being gentle upon both ends; suggesting that they would carefully apply pressure with such an implement for treatment, mindful not to aggravate existing injuries.

From the treatment of wounds to purify humors and aids derived from cuts made by fingers,
When the cold water catharsis comes and continues, and at times humors of the malady expand their size, then both guardianship over them is relieved, and ulcerated eyelids and navels become scaly skin; in the forehead before birth there is a sharp acute pain that extends outwardly consequently. It becomes clear to you through these accidents that materials and catharsis are not coming from their own veins of divided parts but rather due to disturbanse within them, as carried by vessels originating at those divisions.
And the best cure in these is that you command the malady to raise its own forehead, and with your finger make a crack at the spot on the forehead where it lies down (and place the incision within this fissure into the right temple; and insertion of the cut inside the bone), until the bone comes out.
Remove all phlegm or dry lungs and fill the space between their lips' mouth cracks, either in them themselves or on linen as dressing: Whenever there is an excess of pus above in the abdomen and chest, it prevents further suppuration (abscess formation).
When the fever and sweats have subsided, then cover your body where bruises begin to heal (inside you), and apply this carefully prescribed remedy that removes pus from undernethy; as if taking two parts of flour made from wheat and four parts of beeswax. Mix them together, and when applied externally or administered internally in these conditions with respect for the body's natural constitution (using things according to one’s temperament), it becomes a healing paste used on wounds associated with bruises as they begin their regeneration process inside your flesh/skin.

From the treatment of fluid that accumulates in the fingers/toes:
Total cause that occurs in the fingers is one of four species; it may be mineral like iron or tin, similar to stone (iron and glass), caused by fluid as with water and vinegar/acidic liquids, or due to animal likeness—whether a creature itself.
Therefore when blood flows out of the ear or appears similar to those causes that do not settle in the ear, and if you see it (blood flow), it may indicate some form of oil violation or imbalance of body fluids, treat accordingly for its removal, and make them cough up what has come out through stornulation. Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If not extracted already, then apply gentle suction using the specified instruments for which this is the form.
If it is a fistula (foreign body), then be present; and if not, administer its removal gently but repeatedly over small doses of potent herbs or doubling the initial amount until removed.
And if there is not an opening (for the needle), then make and insert a hollow arsenic or lead needle into the extremity of the joint, sealing it with wax and oiled substances to prevent any leakage except for the needle itself. Return the intestine or hernia inside its cavity; where it was previously pushed out excessively with water that we have recently measured and taken into account.
May it not be gout in this manner, then take hold of the leech or worm attached to their vein with pressure applied by hands as needed and pause at the extremity of its course, encasing that spot carefully taken care of. Return that within the throat's cavity for ease of breathing and remove phlegm from the throat.
Thus, if there are all the causes we have recounted, then you must treat that which has just come forth with caution to prevent abscess or spasm formation.

Here comes the sentence to translate: And if that crack in figure is reached by its passage through the stone (the bone), and when the stone has been anguished properly with your appropriate instrument at this time; apply pressure there immediately, healing within it as soon as possible.
If the cause is fat in the artery and has swolthy within it, then administer healing and removal; but if you do not obey your dietary advice, take a gentle touch as follows: And administer that medicine for which he was taken in by it, and apply it where appropriate on him therewith affected (the ailment).
When you think that it has become moistened by the breath of fever and pause there in soft movements, avoiding putting pressure on the joints or gestures subtle enough to induce removal from here, for they have been distracted (likely referring to a state where attention is diverted due to illness).
May it enter the water where the malady enters through the scrotum to complete its course in this body, and fill up one's foreskin with that same water; if by any chance infected waters have entered (through sexual contact), then be ill, but otherwise take stones or pebbles according to length of intercourse inserted into your penis until it reaches the base thereof. Then insert a stone from among those previously placed in one's foreskin back up onto his erect member and jump upon that part containing said stone(s). So that all water inside remains within its place where it has been introduced or poured in (the implication being the body's system).

When an animal is extracted from that hole, if it's a small creature, let it push and appear as though we are dividing here; but if it'suprema force', then extract the one with utmost care using instruments like hooks and knives, placing its cause outside all other causes present in the wound.
When the worm extracted from the artery appears during treatment and you do not comfort this fluid that we have mentioned in division and flow of distillations without providing care for it, then watch over the vein to ensure proper healing.
So then if there is any cause of worms here present, extract that with subtle gestures or gentle movements, may it not be the case without reason; otherwise take a hollow tube drawn up and below which this will form our means. And insert the delicate part under the armpit according to the quantity that suffering may cause; and draw out these secretions with forceful sucking, so long as all worms are expelled from their hiding places (literally: "outside").
If you do not obey the doctor' extramartial guidance, then you will become dull and shut in the channel of the catheter where we have placed it with wax; administer these drips which have already been strained out by ancient remedies during treatment for parasites.

If you wish, take the lamp and wrap it gently around their limb, place oil or some plant juice in the cavity of the chest, or any liquid from these medicines through the canula—which is in your finger—and apply this warmth below them so that when applied pressure upwards, they will expel the contents into the space of the chest where it feels suffocated by oil.

If in the limb where it is located (the affected area), one portion of it is sharp and the other not, and if the thrombus consists of two layers like lions' heads to prevent bleeding into the artery.
And if the swelling is due to raw flesh in the armpit or thigh area, then cut it gently and make an incision therein until all the meat has been removed.
If there is blood on the skin of the earlobe (opulacio), then place it under something subtle like a gentle heat source and apply that to the surface of the wound in the area of the ear, holding your hand over this spot.
Therefore, if there is an excess of water that the uterus deprives due to obstruction (blockage), this lack causes pressure on the womb; be mindful so as not to harm the nerves of the vulva.

The sentence can be translated into English as: "Thus cover those which you have touched or held at once and separate the dirt from their surfaces; place your hand over these cleaned areas." This indicates that after touching something potentially dirty, one should wash it to remove any impurities (spatum) before using a cloth (propit pausa sobre les locs segi trissat), possibly referring to the act of wiping or drying with an emphasis on careful attention.

Here we see advice on using certain tools (inscizios e tropas) which appear to be hard or non-sensational—likely metal implements. These instruments should have a capacity to revert when necessary if there's residual causation for injuries; they are intended specifically for cauterizing at the site of injury, where doing so would effectively "burn

This translation suggests that 'axcirnath' refers perhaps to a particular eye condition or symptom (like tear staining) often seen in pediatric patients. The term might describe discolorations under the eyelids, which worsen with sun exposure and are difficult for individuals affected by them to tolerate due to their reaction when exposed to light. However, please note that without further context or understanding of medieval medical terminology specifics used in this excerpt (since "axcirnath" is not a recognized term), this translation may require confirmation with more specialized knowledge on the subject matter at hand for full

This translation appears to describe a condition related to eye moisture or tears that persist through night and during sleep. The term 'jelous' (downy brows) suggests an area around the eyes which is frequently damp with fluid, possibly indicating excessive tearing ('moisten'). There might be concern about these fluids entering into nearby areas such as nostrils when one comes close to them—implying some kind of empathic or contagion-related fears based on medieval medical belief systems.

Inscribe the adherence under a thin membrane which should not be sharp to avoid bothering the eye with its blink—and remove that membrane from over the pupil, maintaining clarity of vision for your operation (This translation reflects an attempt to convey instructions on how one might perform surgical procedures without irritating or disrupting normal eyelid function while removing a potentially obstructive thin membrane covering around the eye.)
If your incision is meant for easing the attachment beneath, ensure that it allows return of the lid's original shape and heals completely around the entirety (Here we have a translation focusing on ensuring any surgical intervention—specifically an incisional one intended to alleviate adhesions underneath the eyelid—is designed with recovery as its priority, allowing for natural reconstitution of the lid's shape and complete healing.)

The text you've provided is complex and seems to mix archaic or dialectical language with medical terminology, possibly referring to an ancient ophthalmic procedure related to the treatment of eye conditions in historical texts on medicine. Here’s a line-by-line translation attempt:
May the operation in you be that your malady pauses at its jaw under the tongue; and with those hands of yours, collect all the cut flesh conveniently for it, using a forceps or chestnut—and bind the meat within so fully that everything is finished by the instruments (takes), ensuring none of this remains in your hand during the procedure.
And if it is your knowledge that they insert those or small knives into the joint of the finger which has been recommended in our study, here we go:
Therefore, once your understanding is complete and the entire body has been cleansed, fill or distill in it salt flakes or powder of medicinal preparations similar to mercury contained within an album whereby it'thy assuredly bound by apostemate cautery.
If there is any cause of inflammation and swelling that needs to be cauterized with fire, you fear asphyxiation from the burning; heal this edema by applying warmth until it subsides and then repeatedly treat that spot where operation has taken place within which wound dressing was applied. Here "caus" means cause or reason for inflammation/swelling (analogous to modern English terms). The practice involves using heat as a remedy, repeating the treatment on healed areas with specialized bandaging materials.
Even though you attempt to remove all care for the patient'se hernia naturally or accidentally with iron tools, do not insert your hand into any of these operations while observing that the said body part is suffering from it.
In this text from what appears to be an old medical treatise using archaic language
The phrase "Capitol .xviii." seems like a reference or citation, possibly indicating the section number in Roman
The phrase appears to be discussing the management of saddle anesthesia (suggestive terms for loss or numbness in areas such as buttocks and genitals) affecting a patient's back, with instructions on how not to press down upon it while performing certain actions, potentially relating to physical therapy procedures. Here is the translation line by line:
So it is necessary for the meal that you consider whether he in whom this sickness has been found strong and not elsewhere ill; then take that very one who is sick.
You command the malady to cease its flow in the thigh, and place your hand over those veins as necessary according to your discretion; and if it is required that one of these beings doubled under pressure per annum or two years following this pattern.

Here is the translation of each line:
Even if you do not see the blood at the extremities of the spine; and if your work during daytime near the sunlight, be firm in your operation so that only those veins are entered.
When you have completed it all (the procedure or treatment), then draw the decoction into a clean cup, and do so for that your bones will strengthen which has become weakened by what is drawn out from within.
May it not be within your power to collect all of it here at this time; and if so, apply the fluid that exits as its pain does, dressing it daily until the pain subsides and is securely dressed with bandaging.

This phrase, "de reduccio di azzato all'naso," appears in Italian and translates directly
When you care for inflamed joints with cautery or acute medicine following the account of its occurrence and it does not heal, then do not leave them in flesh but cut over their ulceration to remove all moisture that is within, allowing bone (osteo) discovery through drying out.
So when you discover that bone and sometimes in decay or deterioration, it is thus the form of this very structure.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "He is sharp-nosed, and his flesh is iron hardness, and its head returns with ease when taking out for small incisions using a chisel or fine scalpel (in this manner).
When you place your hand over the area where the bone has been crushed and gently rotate it between the thighs (or tighten them slightly), do so gradually until you know that this crushing injury is reduced/smoothed out.
And if there are some dry days ahead, and restore the place where causes that lead to desiccation and precise lesions have occurred.
So if the place is consolidated and good flesh has grown therein for forty days without renewal or puncturing and not falling ill in it, then you know that one recovers their health.
If not, then it is in the body and must be reduced to its shape as a nose; following this methodology: if you find two sharp tools or acute medicine at hand, take them according to this form when they are discovered.
Its metal plate is shaped like a triangle and its wood core has been worn down to the extent of being at the stomach joint with such frequency.
Even the pressure is applied to the bone, and that portion of it near the tear; extend your hand for a few inches along the hip joint, rotate your arm within these limits wherein the humidity enters into the bones, which senses pain when you exert force upon them.

When disruption occurs in the tunica uvea (the vasc0llic covering of a structure like the iris or ciliary body), it exposes its eminent part and proceeds outside as if with an eye-wash, which then seeks to insert itself into the space created by the removed agula from above in that area. You position one end (the primary/leading point) of this instrument according to their arrangement; place another corresponding doubled length piece attached at its back along the part belonging to the lacrimal system and have it penetrate, pushing aside with a gentle touch what was previously removed by agula—this action is executed repeatedly.

This illness that is called "alconati" in fact, is not the one resembling water flowing from joints; it's something else entirely—a different malady requiring care and treatment elsewhere than just at the knee appearing to 'melt away like water.'
May it be that through the act of making holes in the poultice and drying thereon with your hands (and another on their legs), you take hold of each part where pain is felt, gently pressing to prevent moisture from descending further into these parts—thus addressing what ails them. Furthermore, ensure that it remains sufficiently dried out so as not to become wet again; and this will stop the flow (of 'malign humor' or excess fluid), which was previously coming down with urgency like water in those affected areas of disequilibrium ("desej" implies an imbalance).
If it does not fall into its place (referring likely to something that should be in a certain location within the body), then you know there is water involved.
If the descent to health is not prepared with the water we have discussed, then gout will seep between your thighs and you must take a delicate sponge undernethy (the part of the body being referred here seems unclear due to language barrier) covered in that same water which prevents continuation of conjunctival inflammation within the cornea atop the head, until it is expelled.

The notion indicates an empirical approach where observations such as the properties and effects are used for healing purposes in alignment with established health norms
And you must carefully separate the malady between your thighs over a cloth and place it underneic leg (implying an examination or handling of what could be pus for example). Here "stringent" indicates doing so in strict order to maintain hygiene, which aligns with medieval practices focusing on cleanlinfal management. The mentioning of separating the malady signifies a diagnostic action
Apply pressure over the left side of your eyelid if the affected part is on the right (or vice versa), applying it directly to where fluid accumulation might be indicated by eye involvement; or apply gentle firmness with your third hand, which could refer metaphorically as being more distant from immediate direct care. This line reflects a diagnostic approach that tailors physical exams based on the patient's symptoms and suggests treatment localization in alignment with medieval medical reasoning where palpation provided clues to underlying conditions.
Apply pressure with your right hand if the affected part is on the left (or vice versa), touching directly where discomfort or pathology might be present in alignment with symptomatic observation practices of medieval medicine; an action suggesting diagnostic palpation techniques to localize issues as per patient presentation. Here, a direct correlation between physical findings and subsequent actions is indicative of the hands-on examination approach pre

Take pause in the nature of it (understanding or accepting its natural essence), and do not take your head to either third quarter nor south side; this suggests resting without disturbance, likely referring to sleep with certain postures advised for health reasons according to traditional beliefs. It advises keeping oneself oriented properly during rest as per some medical tradition possibly related to alignments or humoral theories prevalent in medieval medicine:

When in the nose are born various kinds of worms and pills without cause that they come together to form scorpions or polyps, this illness is called 'polyp,' which bears resemblance to those pill-shaped ones represented." (Here medieval medical practitioners likely observed nasal growths reminiscent of creatures like scorpions and linked them with the condition they termed ‘polyp,’ possibly due to their appearance.) From it is blackened flesh and pus-filled decay; from it meat does not have a dark brown hue."

Therefore in these conditions where the meat is not fraudulent or cancerous (which were significant concerns), take out and place them under sunlight; bury your hands within it to draw moisture, and spear with tweezers into those areas." (The practitioner here advises handling diseased flesh by removing any pus-filled decay without deceit. They suggest using the warmth of direct sunlight for treatment purposes while physically engaging with the meat—using hands to extract moisture that may help in addressing the issue, and tweezers (or similar tools) are used delicately within these compromised parts.) Extract that from the separated parts, and insert what you have understood of those spirits under which you know all flesh is suspended; if there's any cause in them for abscission (separation or removal), then use one of the delicate instruments at your disposal to facilitate extraction. May you hold on to sanction or sudden decree if necessary; otherwise, for malignant abscesses, then return the detached portion and cauterize what has separated from its seat and left all cavities open.

When translated, this phrase appears in modern language as "From the throat to beyond its limits." This suggests a description of some condition or examination
The translation of this line into English would be: "The throat lingers in the outside limits for several days until its observation is under review by him." This suggests a medical context where there may have been an ongoing examination or condition concerning someone's sore throat that required monitoring over time. Here, 'he/him,' referring to possibly another healthcare provider such as a doctor, would be observing the persistent symptoms for further assessment and management of care
Translated into English, this sentence reads: "For the sake that you have entered his consideration regarding the appearance of him/her," followed by an incomplete statement where 'eredices' (which means to inherit or take over) and further context would be necessary for a complete understanding. This suggests someone is being asked about their The translation of this line into English reads: "And so you pause over the location or wherein there was burning, which is present in his/her place." This indicates that a person may be experiencing some form of discomfort—possibly from an inguinal

This medieval text describes what seems to be an observation or protocol regarding injury care, specifically related to a broken (likely cracked) skull. The context suggests concern for someone injured and possibly the consequences if not addressed appropriately by medical personnel with due urgency and sensitivity. Here 'him' refers back to another character involved in this scenario—possibly fellow healthcare workers or an individual who caused harm, depending on further interpretation of subsequent lines that are cut off from view (noted as "quar motas veguadas...").

You understand that when the continuity in one of these joints (possibly referring to a fracture or dislocation) is compromised during examination, you need not attempt correction without expert intervention from trained medical professionals ("alcu" resembling "allochthonous," indicating outsiders). Translation: You realize that upon discovering the breakdown of continuity in one of
So that when any such cause is identified by the physician ("alcu" for an "allochthonous," or someone who comes from another place), you adjust your lips around it and properly tend to what needs healing within them, referring back at joints (possibly a metapthyical way of saying addressing injuries). Translation: Thus when the cause is determined by the doctor for whatever issue they are examining therein, one should position their own mouth in contact with that which causes it and properly tend to what requires healing inside. This response appears as an attempt at a literal translation but seems nonsensical or incorrect due to probable confusion of medical terminology
If the lips of continuity have already separated and any wound appears to be healing within them (likely referring metaphorically or poetically), then cover that which seems recovering therein with your mouth's flesh, suggesting a protective gesture for regeneration ("excorjes" could mean covering gently).

When the surface of the teeth and forwards part (possibly referring to anterior or front teeth) are adjusted with sharp points, lines, and some measures in yellow/white chalk within which decay enters through the gums—these too become painful sticks." This sentence appears to describe a dental procedure where certain tools made of potentially hard substances like metal (sticks), possibly used for cleaning or adjusting teeth. The use of "yellow/white chalk" might indicate markings on the teeth, and it is implied that these can contribute to decay entering through gums causing pain – a common understanding in historical approaches where anesthesia was not available, leading people often experiensed dental discomfort during treatments.
Therefore when you make a space between your legs and pause the head at the waist, and rub with teeth that appear where those sharp edges seem like sand within which no cause of harm will penetrate due to their blackness (negation) and citrine (citrinitas), as well as any other things properly purified.

Translation of the line about extracting teeth and bone fragments from broken jaws:
When you need to extract the decayed tooth that is causing trouble, let it rest at the edge of a table for one or two days until its cavity has been softened; and afterward apply an anodyne or bandages made from materials in which teeth are assembled (like egg shells or bee wax), using forceps as their shape.
The extras outside of them are also pains stitched with a reed or leather.
If you do not obey my instructions using these forceps or tenalas (tools), then you must dig into the root and remove all flesh, inserting the tool I provide as a small lever like this:
And if it is a short but large part of the body that does not break down or become weakened, then there is nothing to worry about.
So if the razor is used for incision (foray-geta), it must be sharp; otherwise, help yourself with these instruments whose forms include at least one heavy blade shape:

From the treatment of teeth, considerations must also extend beyond them concerning overall oral health and its impact on general well-be0fness in this translation
When teeth are prominent in their natural form and mainly occur in women's breasts (as they often do), it is evident that one must consider: if the tooth itself serves no purpose elsewhere, nor can its removal or ligature be performed using available tools; however, there may not necessarily need to attach this foreign object directly upon it—rather indicate and operate on these as though you are treating pork fat. This suggests employing a sharp steel from India for the procedure – perhaps an instrument shaped similarly (as would naturally occur in porcine tissue) with acute points, much like dental instruments of that era which might have been used to address such conditions effectively within their contemporary medical understanding and practices.
And if your instrument engages this particular tooth for several days as part of its treatment process—ensure that it is not associated with other teeth beyond necessity; in doing so you maintain a focus on the specific issue at hand without causing confusion or additional concerns related to multiple treatments, which aligns well within medieval medical approaches focused primarily and directly on curing rather than complicating.
If the tooth is prominent in decay and requires attention – then proceed with that sharp steel from Indian ironwork fashioned into an appropriate form for this task; carefully remove what needs eliminating, taking care not to involve additional teeth beyond necessity. This instruction reflects a practical approach typical of medieval medical practices where direct intervention was often preferred over more conservative or palliative

However, since these metals can be bent back into shape for a time after being worked on it here is implied that there's an attempt to restore them using bending techniques which might align with some form of ancient dental metalwork repair or restoration practice (Note: The translation attempts to capture the essence and context, but without specific historical knowledge about medieval metallurgical practices for teeth treatment, this interpretation may not precisely match contemporary understandings).

The procedure likely includes manipulating and potentially restraining part of the tongue using nerve ligatures—which could be understood as specialized tools or techniques designed specifically with precise control over specific areas, suggesting a nuanced medical practice aimed at dealing with parasites affecting swallowing ref
If there is any tightness or knotting present (possibly referring to physical discomfort caused by worms), and you wish for the creature's state of affairs—the parasite, in this case—to be resolved through dissolution; cut that ligature according to where it was attached so as not only to release but also resolve any knots or entanglement. This line suggests a treatment process involving cutting off an existing nerve-like structure (ligature) used for restraining the tongue, likely in response to some sort of parasitic infestation that might have led to discomfort and difficulty with swallowing—and see
Guard yourself so that there is not joint cracking in the skin of the flesh and split apart ascorbic acid flow from the sancus (spleen).
And cleanse the marks of incision with warm waters or vinegar and salts, apply pressure to the tongue immediately; this is where the tongue presses on any corner during speech, ensuring it does not solidify at other times.

Some addictions to extract ranulas immediately after the tongue are assembled by small pieces of metal or other materials, which prevent the tongue's own movements and thereby enhance them while inside the mouth. This medieval medical text discusses a method where foreign objects (possibly made from metals) constrain natural tongue motion potentially as part of an attempt to manage conditions like ranulas—fluid-filled cystic masses undernezymedical practitioners in that era, perhaps believing they could help with such les

If it is white and moist (possibly referring to a cyst that has burst or an abscess), then place the onion in there gently while incisionally applying silver dressing beneath; if winds enter during your operation, pause for three times before resuming work, so as not to distress further—this implies taking care of any unexpected interruptions caused by external factors like weather changes which may affect a patient's condition or the healing environment. This line shows an attentiveness to both treatment and environmental conditions that could impact surgical procedures in historical medical contexts where such concerns were recognized, even if their understanding was not as developed as modern medicine today might suggest. The mention of "onion" is likely metaphoric for a wound dressing rather than actual onions—this kind of imagery often appears throughout medieval texts to convey ideas related to cleansing and healing practices using readily available materials such as silver (silver nitrate was known for its antimicrob

When extracting corns and calluses, especially those in the groin area where there is none elsewhere on the body, here comes your sentence to translate:
When gout attacks in the joints, those are the accumulated nodules composed of yellow bones that have not been cured since their division and do not heal with this treatment; when they are hard, dark, devoid of feeling, avoid touching them with iron.
If it is desired for the color and nature to be red and heavy, do not touch that with iron through the flow of blood; leave it within itself until maturation occurs, or if you drag it out yourself, then break it apart by force.
If it is of white or silver hue, subtlety arises from within the patient, then they are considered inscribed (or fixed).
The operation in the body is considered (by you), as a result of your own action; and when it has rested after completing self-catheterization or if there are any diminutions, then straighten the thigh down to the knee joints keeping head on shoulders with hands clasped behind. The servant takes between their fingers holding the tongue deferentially from behind towards noble instruments of which this is form:
And whether it is made of silver or gold, and subtly with a cautery.
So when you perceive that the tongue and show it to me, hold onto their throat gently until they are calm down in peace, then pull them as far back into place as you can manage. Another fluid that you draw out from the tunics (the patient's clothing or skin), and with this same fluid, apply it to the tool which is used for its form.

(Here refers to forceps being assembled with the handles turned outwards; this action causes a pinching effect due to sharpened edges when used together.)
May if this instrument is not with you, then cut that bone from which it comes on; and whether it be one piece or more than one, make sure the cutting does not occur in different parts of the body.
Putting in the incision, according to this method of making an incision, and wet it down with water soaked up from humors.

E she too was a healer from apostasy who had been born in the city (the location is not specified), where her apostasy tended towards blackness, with little feeling and already had an opening made within that very same belly of hers, breathing straight through meat as if starving for food, forbidden to drink water or eat any form of sustenance by this entity she has been (possibly a demonic presence), leading her potentially closer to death should it take one day or two.
The aposteme was so severe that there were three measurements across where it entered through two fractures.
So I took your pulse manually and rested there with one of them, pulling out that large portion from it, taking heed to take care of the other part understood by touching upon it as well; then secured my mouth over its orifice, pressed down his tongue, ensuring both aspects remain within their respective lesions.
Return the intestine or hernia back into its cavity; it only moves slightly within there nowadays (or lately).

When delving into the depths when one becomes absorbed in study, particularly within a historical context where medical knowledge was often transmitted through such dedicated immersion
When arthritis affects the joint of the hip (hubula), it is deep and prolonged ("es apostemada"), hence there'dictly no perpendicular line can be drawn to describe its extent accurately; if instead, in a part where bone is thickened and round-shaped ('grossa e redonda'), then the term used for this condition would likely refer metaphorically as "bubble" (which may relate historically or regionally specific terminology).
When healed with the water that we have spoken of in division, do not interfere with your treatment, and even when you apply a cauterization needle (which is subtil), after placing it on what has been added roundly; if directed to where lengthy or long red/black blood flows outside its center point, hold onto the expectation that there will be fear over here.
When you turn that second movement they told him about his whiteness and lengthiness, so make the malady (joint pain) open up with a tool of which process shapes its form and settles there as an ointment in the newness; then draw out that thing using one or two instruments used for inspection inside each triangle formed by moles.
When what is not inserted there but rather that which has been adjusted to the patient'se natural condition may be put in place; if you insert it from here, speak your language then.
Return their legality (the intestine or hernia), using the water we have prepared for it in the area of two thighs; take care that which is healed within this space.
If the abdomen is terrified due to its ignorance, and uses fear during cauterization, this anxiety about using a heating tool for treatment is nothing but acute water pain, and you should pause at the waist of the patient'se wherein place your hand on their tongue with that very instrument we have mentioned before, and also hold cold water from our previous discussion in the cauldron used for cauterization; comforting this living cause thereof. And cease motion neither thick nor subtle here—that is to fulfill what was said about its form:
The external cavity in which medicine is applied corresponds to the hollow of a knife blade and rests on the instrument used by medicine, so that saliva or mucus from the mouth of this person does not enter into the medicinal application itself and thereby prevent any cause arising within it.
Here you are with your hand in medicine, and express it through the space of my tongue inside while I eat so that what is consumed can be blackened and numbed by the bite of medicine.
If you wish, prick the wound and cover it with this material over the extremity of the ray (referring to an arrow or bone injury), immerse the covering in medicine, ensuring that as much is absorbed into the cannula where the dressing adheres; thus achieving what amounts medically necessary for cauterization like wine. Once this amount has been reached and it takes about three days or four for healing to occur:
If indigestion occurs while you are practicing medicine, repeat that treatment and apply cautery to the circuit of wine in the pot at the beginning, cleaning away any water present therein, washing it with water for cleansing, curing from within using embrocation, and insert into intestinal obstructions until healed.
This remedy for healing has been placed with care and used out of fear or caution.
Alcunas curaciones take place when submerged under water in this remedy: calamint, yarrow, rue, scraped Arabic, camomile, sage, and wormwood are added to these herbs; all causes or some of them are ground into a paste within the vessel. The mixture is then fully immersed in water, left for hours until sediment forms at the bottom (and possibly foam on top). A stone trap lies at the surface of this liquid bath where an instrument made from silver according to this treatment method rests; it can be either silver or a similar material used by doctors.
And insert the limb into the mouth of the malady while the vapour presses on the soft palate causing it to become dimmed.
Here applies pressure on that dry motion within which it occurs and ensure you do not perform this treatment when the patient is undergoing an apothecary'supremacy (or current remedy), as too much adjustment would worsen the splint, but rather follow the instructions of the apothecary.
May it not be that you do not have this instrument with you? Then take a cane and make an enclosure outside of yourself using the goat'sear (goatee), so that the mouth of the bladder is lubricated, for the smoke from the fire prohibits such.
This treatment is good for health.

From the extraction of blood attached to arteries (presumably within a surgical setting). This sentence seems incomplete and may lack specific details, but here's my best interpretation for translation:
When medicine requires the extraction of blood that has been identified in medical treatment and does not cause discomfort, consider now entering into the artery within the groin (presumably where access to an artery might be gained for such procedures), using a tongue made specially as your instrument. This translation assumes "sanqu" refers specifically to something extracted from blood ("medicine"), that there's some context of medical treatment, and possibly historical or less formal forms of surgery due to the mentioning of an artery in the groin for extraction (which aligns with medieval practices). The term “guolayro” might correspond to ‘groin,’ where certain procedures could be conducted. "Instrument le qual a tu havem recomtat" likely means 'the instrument you have
And if when removing the blood (sanquisuga), extract it either slightly or with delicate movements gentle in motion away from there. The translation here implies that once extracted—likely referring to procedures like lancing an abscess for drainage, commonplace at a time without modern antiseptics and precise instruments as
And if it is not possible to remove from there, then take a concave cannula and insert into the groin (where access was previously obtained), placing fire in its concavity; do so until enough fluid has been drawn out—ensuring that all blood extracted remains within said instrument's hollow space throughout the day. Here 'fire' likely refers to heating or sterilization of the cannula, a rudimentary form of antiseptic practice aiming at preventing infection before germ theory was understood and proper surgical tools were available as an additional source sentence for translation:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If there is not a treatment prescribed by the physician for what we have recommended, then let us dampen the malady in either the chest or abdomen with a warmth applied through the instrument used during fumigation of the uvula.
When it occurs in this way (inquiring about a situation where something happens suddenly), then say that they fall ill quickly.
Another operation technique in absorption of that fluid (which may be referring to the process used by doctors for some treatment), is when you take hold of an oiled layer where there are hot gases and a cover over it, within which there's a disruption; and withdraw from underground moisture. Then position their mouth at the tip of the canula (the instrument being operated on) to ensure that subterranean absorption is not directly entering while you know that the groundwater has been reached by this procedure - causing them to fall ill quickly as a result.
If not already done so, then perform the subfumigation movements repeatedly, and prevent the melancholy from drinking, eat salty and alcoholic foods, and do not drink water; as it is necessary that this regimen be followed strictly.
This is the form of the tool with which one extracts pus from an abscess when seen; it resembles forceps but without any curvature herein. the table where this is kept, and its extremity resembles the beak of a ciconia (stork), which it wards off with lime, for as long as any cause persists, that thing shall not touch him.

Even if there are some warts that have not been pierced but rather represent the advanced stage of illness in those areas, or their complements.
So other instruments that are dislocated when crossed and do not mature according to their complements, like those intended for joints, become prolonged within the body cavity where they circulate, corrupting the ligaments or nerves of that joint; if you delay this perforation inside a fully developed member (probably referring to an organ), then it will be ruptured in its non-matured state. If it is not related to digestion and concerns instead the buttock, puncture where appropriate; do so only on that which has maturely formed therein: this causes a fistula (an abnormal passageway), or becomes painful within the body without healing. Must you know the time of the puncture for the abscess, and then it is when it ripens.
E understand that it matures when the pain yields and fever subsides; reduce speechlessness and heartbeat, strengthen the head of abscess, and other limbs.
Where you know that a puncture wound is present in the place where pus and drainage have appeared, following treatment of an abscess.
Here is the translation line by line:
When the abscess is in a fleshy location, then we must insert our instrument into it while confirming that digestion has reached its second complementary stage; if you pierce this area at this time, the leg of the patient and their mouth become sore due to hardness, as does the depth.
May one make an incision according to the body's flesh or bone structure as necessary; it should correspond with what is required by that particular member of the body which ingests (the patient).
When you administer a small puncture, and for larger or wide incisions according to the variety of sizes of the apasts (instruments used for making surgical incisions), here is what should be done:
And among those things where the cecum is pierced and inflamed when it hurts due to bread intake or other terms that cause bleeding like dropsy and swellings, at which point your hand should be placed there too, alongside what you have caused with bloodletting.
From those who have three angles in their side section; and from them is where they are inserted like the feathers of a phoenix or the appendages of joints.
From those joints where medication is administered in a round and moon-shaped manner, they appear to resemble them (them referring back to the body parts mentioned).
May those who cannot endure with their surface appendages (like nails) should not attempt to pierce that which you have already penetrated only shallowly.
When the abscess is large and has collected pus, do not attempt to extract all of it in that hour; they take out one part from there, and place it inside another piece today, taking a larger portion each time according to gradual progression until it's fully drained.
Mostly if the malady is due to excessive bile or liver trouble, or in old age and weakness when animal spirits move within causing expulsion of illness, then it exits from the body where you operate on them.
Be very careful with this large incision, and place your knife there where you pierce the thorns; consider if the worm from the thorn is small or a series of flat ones—administer these as appropriate to him or her (patient); but if it's a large worm and fissures in the incision are present, cover your knife with lint at every bend where we meet.
If in the abscess there is an absence of part of the colon or if that area has been concave within its circuit, then take care to close it with fine cloth or metal wire as you do when sewing up wounds; and keep moisture on it throughout the day until tomorrow. Then process and treat what comes out during dressings for abscesses due to intimate cleanlinies inside that heals well nowadthy waters have taken effect.
If you exacerbate the flow of blood during your operation, then administer cold water and compress these areas where clothes are wrapped around it to pause that specific area's circulation of venous stasis.
If you persist in the flow of blood, then take care and use these powders that I have recommended for specific locations within this very book and division.
If it is wintertime and the site of sores (ulcers/lesions) is a place where nerves are moved, then cover them with crumbs made from wine and oil, placing these above those spots.
If it is summer and the places are carnivorous, then when you rest on pebbles at the beginning in water and oil (and possibly wine and vinegar), do so throughout the day as we have said beforehand, and cover up any ulceration that comes out of your body while cleaning this matter within which has entered into it for healing.

Second in the color of its body and belonging to it as a wick or thread; they are second spices/herbs (and possibly fats), which contain moisture within them—accordingly, their colors correspond with that wetness." This medieval Latin text describes elements – likely culinary herbs described metaphorically here. The 'thread' analogy suggests these items have a slender or delicate nature and are second in importance to something else (possibly primary spices). It hints at the presence of moisture ('humiditat') that influences their color, reinforcing the idea they share characteristics with water-based elements – this could be interpreted as how these herbs may appear lighter or more delicate and possibly fresher when compared to drier components.

This medieval medical treatise passage discusses methods for treating mites that are associated with diseases (presumably rheumatism) using moisture-containing ones or those enclosed like pearls according to the lunar cycle. It suggests a treatment protocol whereby any mite removed due to illness should be cleaned out and replaced within 24 hours, possibly reflecting humoral theories of medicine prevalent at that time which connected bodily health with balanced body fluids (humors).

When varicose veins are ruptured and the hernia is reinforced over that area: when an abscess associated with a thrombosis or phlebitis occurs in these areas (the legs), you will feel discomfort, which can also manifest as stridor. Herein lies how to identify arterial versus venous inflammation and abscesses within the body based on where they cause pain: if an abscess is due to varicose veins it becomes lodged in the calf; when pressed upon its lumps, one feels discomfort there.
When that individual is brought forth from a vein, it shows itself in the body part.

The provided text is indeed a Latin passage that discusses various reasons for navel care in medieval medicine:
If there is a crack in the cistern and through the skin' extruded pus appears red like body parts; it looks like a lion’s pain, appearing from various situations. If it is due to the escape of the intestine, then once you have established what we've discussed today about that which has come out (the escaped intestine), taking into account its powerful differences, and with this in mind, return; thus your patient will be back here again. And as they are brought back by bathing and vigorous exercise:
If it is due to moisture, then the dragon does not hide when you press with your hand, nor does it contract or become rigid.
If it is sickness (likely referring to fever), then as soon as these signs appear on their bones, show the symptom of black decay descending.

May it be because of wind movement, then this touch is like a lion.

If the prominency of the navel is due to either the intestine or the sling, then command that which holds it within its place and extend; and secure your seal throughout the entire circumference of the navel, where you have previously placed a cushion on top. Place yourself between their thighs over them while holding their hands, and order as follows:

If it is contrary to your artery or vein, surround that area, and return to your work at hand; take two needles and insert them into those fields strong enough so as not to break through the syphilitic lesions you have opened in the groin region, where they penetrate with pins. Then tighten the syphilis abscess over four parts using these inserted needles.
If you wish to do so, place the needles and insert them into where flesh is stretched out and protrudes; when they are subtly inserted and become embedded within it, take care of that which comes from the liniments used inside for healing purposes.
If the navel's prominence is of fleshless or due to moisture in him/her, then cover that hernia you have found with cloth and drain out any fluids contained within it, which constitutes its essence inside them, and take care of this fluid by removing what covers (the swelling) and draining the humidity.

If the head of the veil is corroded and destroyed in an instant, then place a lead pipe into the scrotum to allow for drainage through that channel; this means introducing a tool (the lead pipe) to create a passageway so urine from the affected area can be expelled.

In the attachment of the prepuci at its head (where it joins with the foreskin, and here no circumcision is required; that area does not need excising), when adhesion occurs due to dirt or scab—then scrape a blunt spatula inside where the ligament has dissolved, removing completely even the head of the prepuci. Here it describes an early surgical procedure possibly used in medieval medicine: cleanly cutting away any stuck foreskin (prepuci) with adhesions using scraping tools like sharp stone or metal spatulas to remove both skin and scar tissue after dirt has been removed from the area where ligaments are affected. It reflects a rudimentary yet practical approach to address male genital issues in times when medical understanding was limited, without relying on modern surgical equipment or techniques. This procedure may have involved personal skill and experience rather than standardized procedures as understood today.
If it is difficult to desire those exquisitely, then cover your spine and penis with some cloth as quickly as possible to find the cause of pain at the head of the verge and prepuce, so that when you do perforate them gently due to their delicacy.

In the simplification and care of those boys who have undergone circumcision.
Circumcision is not a solution for continuity with other diseases: but when it comes from our operation and willpower, and in children specifically, we must assign them to the better treatment course as quickly as possible for salvation.
Thus, they say that ancient ones did not perform circumcision around the time of liberty, nor do so in their laws today, and only have them for experimentation purposes. This is why most artisans and barbarians use new razors and knives; using leather straps and scalpels (or cutting tools with a sharp edge).

When referring to the care for retained urine in the bladder, here is the translation:
Retain urine in the bladder as it may be due to excessive flesh accumulation or stone formation within/from stones or fistulas, resembling those mentioned by healers for curative purposes during division.
If there is no dissolution of the fluid we have mentioned beforehand and it becomes vehemently painful upon extraction using an instrument that you call (the syringe), here comes a source sentence to explain: It may be made from silver or subtle lion, with delicate precision like the tip of a long finger or middle finger.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: When it is necessary that urine collection for him who grips and lies outside of this fabric, you insert the external parts of the instrument into the hollow part near the bladder; then cut away any superfluous material with scissors if there's a cause within the wool, otherwise place directly in the catheter following urgency.
When one applies the malady on the sole of the foot and binds the bladder, vein, and ligament together with oil and wine,
Here comes the translated text line by line:
Expose gradually the metal (the cautery) in fleece small by small, until it is completely covered with wool.
Return that part for cleansing with urine and apply a compress; do not cease to use the washer (ciringua) until the bladder and hernias are relieved, easing their discomfort.

sino que in the exterior of it is silent, so it is closed. And in that way there are three troubles: twice from one side.
In the meal is calmness found, in which it draws and whereupon its second quantity ascends above that drawn by those humidities, when any cause lifts such from these fluids; furthermore, once expelled, again to be pulled back at will of this fluidity. And whenever lifted long enough beyond return, then naphtha appears within the wounds suffered in sea battles.
So when you want to prevent moisture in the bladder, insert the extremity of clogs into the moisture, and draw it out towards that water which pushes down on the parts below, wherein the moisture is drawn upwards.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "Return the intestine or hernia into its cavity; and propel the moisture that you are expelling, which goes directly down towards the bladder, and thus it causes malady.
The form of the clyster under which the bladder becomes distended is as follows:
And whether it is silver or side-based pain, they have placed the head as if to a small feather on him/her and quickly inserted lancet into his/her limb.

We already have it in the division of stones and care for them as medicine, and the difference between stone formed on urine and that originating from bladder." (This translation into English interprets a likely instruction or observation regarding medical treatment approaches to different types of kidney stones during medieval times.)
We have it where the operation takes place and sectioning." (Here again Latin is used with an indication that there'sintervention in a specific area of treatment—likely referring to surgical procedures for kidney stones

So it is said that the stone originating from the bladder mainly affects children; and their urine, when evacuated from the bladder, resembles water in subtlety, appearing therein like sand; while stones are rubbed on its rim by hands or tweezers (veges), and those responsible for it dress up—these they take to town square as evidence." (This translation suggests that a particular type of stone disease predominantly impacts children. The resemblance in urine color is metapsologically described, likening its clarity or translucency to water with sand-like granules visible when the flow occurs through an instrument known possibly as a 'cuve'—a container for collecting and examining bodily fluids.) Additionally, individuals (potentially caretakers) physically handle stones from patients by rubbing them on rims. They then present these findings in public to emphasize their evidence or symptoms of the condition being discussed – possibly an effort at diagnosis confirmation or for community awareness during a time when
And it is a healing for those children within that have reached twelve years old, and treatment in the limbs is difficult. May happen in young people between those waters (possibly referring to body fluids or humors).
From which stone (or material) it is made of if its weight is heavy and the cure seems easier to apply lightly on top; If however it's scanty or small in quantity, contrary to that one.
So when approaching the treatment of that, cover their thighs with a linen wool from which we extract out all holes where it has escaped into your tubes; thereafter this hole may be occasionally prohibited to prevent further blockage by dirt or stone particles being investigated.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: Return its position in their thighs and contents are excessive or gouty for it that bone may descend into the bladder'se socket, or jump out of place a few times.
Here comes the first source sentence: Return that cautery you have prepared within yourselves, and all of them are now things from themselves, so that the bladder as a whole descends gradually into parts.
Return (or restore) that part which is diseased completely.
So if you feel pain in the space (possibly referring to a hernia), then pull your cushion so much over it there.
If you do not touch the entire body at once, then take out some oil as indicated by the left hand for a young person with flatulence or as shown by the middle finger if completed in youth, and insert it into their bottom. Through the entry of the stone that has been lodged inside for a while, it enters into the bladder through which urine is discharged. When that small one is converted into something within the bladder neck (the area where the urethra meets the bladder), it means repositioning or redirecting what
And position your hand over that which is said to be there below (likely referring to an area beneath the patient), and expel it from those parts beyond where the bladder resides within its location. In simpler terms, this could mean applying pressure or performing a manual technique on the lower abdomen in order to help urine pass through past the site of
And commands the minister to press on the bladder with his hand; and orders another minister to extend their arm(s) downwards towards those parts below (likely referring to stimulating muscles or applying pressure in that area), while using their other hand, draw back tightens a catheter which has been inserted into these locations previously for urination assistance.

You understand that from the stone there is some wherefrom whence removal of it will be difficult by water.
From that fluid it appears like a lion, round and made of bloodletting; this is what must be extracted from the body.
Therefore adjust it in the crack.
If there is not a hole made for catheterization (foregoing the term 'fore-getted', which may refer to an indwelling device like a drain or tube), then you must create one over that, whereby if stretched upon the skin it will have its limit and won't slip away; else insert gradually your slender instrument of curvature undernethy.
If you cannot cover it there, then increase the disruption slightly and if you see a flow of phlegm present, sever that which has been previously treated with sulphur melted thrice.
If the stone is within one of them (the body parts being referred to), then you will lead it into the mouth of the bladder, and place your hand over that part; also carry a small amount with you—it appears as pains from diseases.
If there is much pain (or intense suffering), it is due to ignorance that you have immersed the large section of your body herein, which leads to harm in either its staying or departure from continuous urine discharge; hence, the location is not fully consolidated.
May you administer the removal of it within which has gone out (likely referring to a substance or organ that needs extraction), either by hand when outside, or with instruments during fracture breaks where they are inside as forceps extracting it into pills.
So when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with Aloe and dragon'se sanctus (likely referring to a plant or substance used for its healing properties), and strengthen it furthermore. And on that cloth steamed with oil and vinegar or water steam, to ensure the applied poultice softens it down.
Return the belly over the patient's chest and do not loosen the sinew within it by daybreak.
When that air escapes, apply water and oil herein within so that it heals therewith.
May you cauterize the wound if it is inflamed and decayed (and seems like its bladder has frozen), for then insert the tube into the bed, remove that sack, which may provoke further deterioration of both the bladder and putrefaction.
Return the water with vinegar and salt therein; all else is against it, as far as healing waters are concerned that come for you within which cure them.
During all of the healing process, when you have both knees and thighs open, adjusting the stopped remedies on this location.
If the stone is small and located in the bladder, and it stays therein, injection of urine is prohibited; otherwise healing occurs due to this treatment directed at ascending stages, which have been previously accused as a blockage. You already extracted the substance (urine), now you take hold of an iron knife for puncturing—this is its form:
From outside the womb, gout is found in a pipe (likely referring metaphorically as it's not literally possible). Here are my translations for each line of the source text
And secure with fidelity to that stone (possibly referring to an urinary calculus or bladder stone), thus keeping it from returning back into the bladder vessel/urinary tract. Here's my translation: And ensure faithfulness, anchoring at that jagged stone so as not for it to go back into the blad
And insert iron within that stone with ease while using the puncture tool to reach into that pit/stone. Here's my translation: And introduce metal wire into that stone effortlessly, guided by a needle-like instrument directly towards that cavity/stone defect. The translations provided attempt to convey medieval medical terminology and practices as they relate to gout treatment in the context of urinary tract And rotate the puncture tool within that small pit/stone gradually until it pierces through, allowing for your other hand to make contact with another portion of the stone and push downwards—ultimately releveasing the bladder contents at once (this suggests a technique used in urethral catheterization). Here's my translation: And gently turn that puncture instrument within that small pit/stone incrementally until it penetrates, while your other hand makes contact with another segment of the stone and exerts downward pressure—ultimately emptying out (or
And place your hand over the area where it has been broken away from that stone'thy part outside of its cavity—here resides a hole through which urine flows out and into healing (this refers to post-procedural care, likely after fragment removal or catheterization). Here is my translation: And position your hand over the location where it has been detached from that stone's exterior cave — here there’s an opening for urine flow which leads towards its restoration. The translated lines follow medieval medical language and convey specific procedures related to managing stones within the bladder,
If this cure is not within your reach for any reason that prevents you from doing so, then apply a poultice immediately to the skin, and another paste below it as well. Return above the bone in that groove between ribs. Return that outwardly (or) draw it forth outside; in this context likely referring Draw back the ligament and moisten the inflamed joint with salve made from mud here on earth—this likely means to apply healing balm or ointment prepared using natural materials like soil (represented by "plagna" which could be understood as common dirt, ground substances
It is not necessary for the patient to have foul urine (implying poor health or impure substances), but rather so that it does not return into the bladder; and another ligament above, unless when this part of the anatomy—the egressive vein from the penis—has been drawn away with forceps as mentioned earlier ('la egrixcio'), which then returns to its original place in society (body) and reclaims its position among people.
When it is necessary for you to lift the underside of his/her penis upwards towards the parts beneath (presumably during a procedure), raise your hand accordingly and restore what was previously taken out together with children who were present at that moment.

The translated sentence would read: “If there is a stone in any of them (the women), it’s difficult to cure and its removal by forceful means is forbidden.” This highlights the perceived complexity or impossibility of removing such stones without causing harm, according to medieval medical doctrine. In modern terms, this may metapthyically refer to conditions like kidney stones which can
The line translates as: “One of them is the woman with fair skin.” Here we are referring possibly to a specific case or type within medieval medical texts that categorizes individuals
The translated sentence would read: “Another is the woman with dark skin that you cannot extract from a doctor when she takes it out.” This indicates an observation made in medieval medicine regarding extraction of impurities (which might be interpreted as black bile, one of the four humors) based on physical characteristics such as skin color. In contemporary language, this reflects early misconceptions about bodily fluids and their
The line translates as: “Pure is the woman who knows this art; mainly through operation.” Here we are discussing a situation where purity in women (perhaps referring to balance of humors or spiritual/moral cleanliness) can be achieved primarily by surgery
The translated line would read: “And the location of this stone in a woman’s body is longer than that of the stone itself; therefore before extraction, one must seek out where it has lodged.” This sentence suggests an acknowledgment within medieval medical texts regarding how to locate and subsequently extract supposed stones from women's bodies – possibly referring not only physically but also metaphorically in terms of spiritual or bodily purity. In modern terminology: the implication might be related to understanding where
If it is necessary to induce sweating (to treat the condition), then take hold of a female medical student'sear and apply gently without causing discomfort.

May it not be a sign of illness; if so, the matron directs that her duty is inserted into the cavity of the sickbed and positioned over the bedpost, placing one hand on the left bladder for support, ensuring no leakage occurs.
So if you abuse it, gradually increase that which is orrified in the bladder to its parts above until reaching the entrance of the hernia whereby by virtue will come into being at this place.

Thus you understand how many spices are needed for what you indicate about this that will come.
If you see the flow of blood escaping, adjust it in the glass where it has been trisected and place your hand there so that the bleeding stops, after which return to your operation until the wound is healed.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If you see flux of rheum (indicating a discharge or exudation), and know that its expulsion is due to the insidious arsenic (arsenicum impurity affecting health), then place powder over the location, gently apply pressure with pebbles and strictures downward without further interference; keep pressing it until there'thy improvement. Here, by not removing what has been expelled naturally but instead applying gentle measures to relieve symptoms caused by such impurities, you may see recovery of the patient (malady). Return care for the child (or possibly "return tender loving care" or similar interpretation
So when the sharpness of pain heightens each day, and it occurs here (implying now or during this specific time), you return to your work until the stone is crushed down/ground away.

El texto que has proporcionado trata sobre una hernia hidrococelear o inguinal (conocida en español como "aygua"), la cual se caracteriza por el ascenso de agua dentro del canal femoral, donde está contenido el intestino.

El texto describe un proceso por el cual se forma una hernia debido a tensión en el tejido pangennial (proprio peritoneum), especialmente cerca de la región inguinal donde está ubicado y sostiene los intestinos, dentro del canal femoral. Menciona que hay otra presencia allí ya sea otro órgano hueco como un segmento íleo o parte distal del colon (entroque cuidat), añadiendo tensión al área preexistente entre la inguinal fossa y el ligamento inguinal, no siendo solo una simple acumulación de líquido sino algo más tangible
La generación de esta hernia se debe a una causa desconocida mencionada como "debilidad" que afecta directamente al intestino (genéticos), permitiendo la salida o expulsión del contenido interno hacia el área externa, donde puede ser palpable. Además, algunas de estas hernias pueden manifestarse a través del sonido emitido cuando se aplica presión física directamente sobre los intestinos (percussio fayta). Estas descripciones reflejan la comprensión

If moisture is present in the patient's pancreas, then there will be an abscess formation which comes out of it and thus makes him appear as another humer (shoulder).
If there is moisture between the navel and the umbilicus (belly button), then it will be in the center of the body.
When you wish to learn about the color of humidity, observe the moisture in which it enters where its form is preceded; and as soon as this comes into contact with your skin at that place, look for the same type of moisture therein.

Here is the translation line by line:
If you have corrupted the humors by another illness, then take care of those vessels through which the humor flows and extract the excess humors, taking into account what we have mentioned earlier.
If water is added to any parts of the body, you will understand that these are hernias; therefore inspect and incise that part where you have previously cut in another area; if it's an operation for you, then perform it.
Take away the sanction and introduce them into wool soaked in oil or vinegar-soaked; hold back another piece of such wool that you have submerged in wine and oil, stretching it over two thighs (the abdomen) and above. Then pause beneath folded towels and pullovers, holding them together with the same thread as follows:

And some times this hernia is treated artificially with pointed cautery at the site of detachment; and it so happens that you grasp a delicate pointed cauterization instrument under your thumb, inserted into the belly button area where white speckled water (pus) has been discovered inside, then proceed as follows: And they come together in Greek letters.

Return the sinew or tendon that is cut, and cleanse it with razor sharp instruments for precise incisions; proceed until you have eliminated everything within reach of your blade. Be mindful not to let the flame touch the steel of your tool.
Be aware that this operation is safe and prevents loss of blood flow, better than cauterization with a ligature (or tie).
May if you find that an abscess forms when draining or performing drainage (curettage), which is what happens to you now, then attend immediately to the treatment as indicated hereafter.
May if the patient is in pain, and does not hope for a second operation due to its horror, then apply as recommended by us; when you have verified that it has been said about their significance, which means this hernia is indeed swolthy (or large).

Your translation appears to convey the following: "You fear being lost in this chapter about hernias, so that I see its release and salvation through it." Here is an interpretation of each line for clarity:
And remember that operation in which those instruments were used.
So say that the swelling occurs in the joints where tendons are attached and pain comes due to acute excess or impact: either it bursts into the joints, or because of a hit.
And according to its colour following that of the body, it is not in vain for pain, and severe inflammation occurs herein.
When it is opened (the wound), its color is black and has not healed yet at this location.
Some movements may cause pain due to the contraction of those joints where it has already been noticed a memory or swelling in them, either because they are inflamed (of that very place), or because there is an inflammation of the veins.
May that which is for inflammation of the joints be known through separation by incision when you compress it with those bands, and do not touch it thereafter.
May that which is pained by inflammation of a vein not be scattered from here due to any cause, and it should receive compression in those places.
Here comes the first source sentence translated line by line into English:
Then if it is that flesh has hardened there, remove the fat and insert what you have taken out.
If there is adhesion within any cause of chyle or between the vessels, then you must release all that adhesion and inject it in a circular manner through injection.
If the location of meat is behind where it currently lies, then insert all that you find there from within its cavity, and extract with care what has been inside as if we have already discussed this matter together.

From "the treatment of intestinal protrusion." Here, the author seems to begin discussing a specific method
The arrival of this hernia is due to a section whereby it extends over the stomach's interior cavities; thus when these intestinal protrusions reach towards the internal sections, they indicate a breach in those areas. Here, "the advenment" likely refers to the occurrence or manifestation of an inguinal hernia within the groin area (where angunars could be understood as parts/angulae). The use of Latin-influenced language suggests this text comes from a time when medical terms were not standardized, and such phrases would have been common
This rupture is either of the cushion or due to discontinuity; these organs are purged for various reasons: by hitting (percussio), pressing down on them forcefully with instruments such as a screwdriver handle, crying out loudly enough that it causes strain and potential injury ("sautz"), through strong coughing spells or violent exertions of any kind; because they are affected due to the reasons like these: hitting upon something hard (percussio), by applying pressure with instruments such as a screwdriver handle, loud crying out (clamor), raising up from physical strain caused perhaps during strenuous activities ("elevatio"),
When the cushion is extended and causes strain over long periods without healing properly (not curing), it develops a lesion within its flesh, which then protrudes into one's abdomen through specific body openings around where this padding resides. In translation: Whenever there’s extension of the cushion that leads to persistent discomfort over time without proper healing ("no accideys soptament"), it results in a sore or lesion (apostema) inside, which then emerges through body openings near where this padding is situated.

And if there are causes of bubbles within the wombs (which is another way to say 'genitals' or related structures in medical terminology), then they are few, and return into them at all times." The sentence seems complex due to archaic language mixing; here’s a clearer interpretation: "If there were any bubbles within the genital area (like gonorrheal blister-forming lesions which can
If the time of applying heat is prolonged, adjustments are made in order to keep the cautery within its place; and as this heats up the cavity (which can be understood metaphorically), it causes an extension into that area where discomfort has been felt on the joints. This results not only from expansion of said heat but also aids softening of the site with attention given to those areas experiencing distress." The sentence translates as follows:
The treatment of him is with pointed cautery as it has been described for him.

When addressing the treatment of discomfort in males' scrotum (testicles), it is indicated that for certain conditions affecting tissues between these organs to be alleviated or soothed, and after which close monitoring should follow as per medical guidance. This reflects a traditional approach where manual intervention aimed at reducing localized edema may provide relief from associated pain in cases of scrotal swelling (possibly due to varicocele), with subsequent observation for changes indicative of improvement or
Following this procedure aimed at treating the male urethra (where fluid leakage occurs), which involves addressing any swelling within that region, and enclosing everything in its natural scrotum cavity where soothing was previously applied—this necessitates close supervision for two days. In addition to this treatment approach, appropriate adjustment of the lips or labia is required if surgical suturing (stitches) has been performed as part of repair and care. Here it implies a post-surgical management phase focusing on wound healing within that short period with particular attention given to any alterations in genital hygiene necessitated by the procedure, potentially indicative of steps for
Moreover if you wish to include an additional measure in the treatment regimen—this would involve three or four heating applications of scrotum care, followed by firm stitching as part of wound management and recovery process after such medical interventctl; this suggests a combination therapy approach where heat application might be used for pain relief and to promote blood flow (as an adjunctive treatment),

In Act V of this medical text or legal document (assuming "Capitol" refers to such), it'dicts that castration is forbidden by law in our country; however, I remind myself now about the matter because there are two reasons for doing so: firstly—whenever a doctor addresses me on these issues and explains how they should be treated (the treatment of this issue); secondly, when we need to castrate other animals like horses or oxen for their health as well as ours; even if necessary due to motion needs similar to mules but different from donkeys.

The sentence indicates a focus on internal imbalances, specifically related to bodily humors or fluid balance, and suggests treatment should target this underlying issue instead of addressing only
This scrotal discomfort is better than the one caused by pressure; heavy lifting often leads to a desire for relief from pain in the patient's genital area (Translating this into modern English, it suggests that physical strain or excessive effort can exacerbate localized pain and implies seeking rest as remediation). The sentence discusses different types of discomfort within the scrotum—physical pressure versus possibly heavy labor. It indicates a preference for natural healing when one's body see

Of treating hernias, or protrusion from the body:

Some measures of that fluid present in the bladder found within the scrotum, which is related to it there.
In women, there is a special aspect: it is that their womb (uterus) sits above the pubic bone with two small pelvic glands below each one like little testicles of man and four in total at the base of these structures.
The cure is composed of three kinds: two from men and one derived from women. Here comes the sentence to translate: For you have inserted those joints back into where they escaped from therein, and for that treat any other diseases present in them as well.

The English translation for the continuation of your sentence could be: "It may occur due to illness which has come before it or because of an improperly applied cloth (or gauze) dressing, or perhaps a delicate suture." This indicates that complications such as tears in the alar clamp might arise from pre-existing health conditions, incorrect application during treatment, or even
The continuation in English translates to: "It may happen during the mother's pregnancy or on her clothes and skin; from pus that comes out of it (the alar clamp), as well as drainage, suctioning, and childbirth. Furthermore, these actions are strictly prohibited." This suggests that certain interventions around a patient who is experiencing complications related to an arras may be restricted for health or safety reasons in the context of medieval medical practice:

There are various worms with sharp spikes in the eye, along with abscesses and ulcerations, bleeding points, inflammation of membranes (which could refer to conditions like conjunctivitis), fistulas from draining pus or fluids due to an infected area. The mentioning of "crane" suggests a reference perhaps not directly related but possibly connected with the overseeing aspect in medieval times when physicians might have been called upon for their expertise, while also implying that these worms are causing severe eye issues requiring medical attention beyond basic first aid ("motas specias"). And you have described these ailments and the species of those worms (involving possibly ophthalmic parasites) along with their respective cures in this division or section where they are being treated, indicating organized medical knowledge on handling such infestations within medieval medicine. The reference to "senhals" might be a metaphorical way of referring not only the actual physical
The section where you find this treatise covers the method of handling a worm infection (likely an ophthalmic infestation) that occurs when these parasites inhabit or proliferate within the eye, and if one wishes to know how it is done effectively—presumably with iron filings. In medieval times without advanced medical technology, treatment such as this would suggest a rudimentary understanding of germ theory; however, practices were often rooted in empirical evidence rather than scientific reasoning that prevailed later centuries. Iron's properties might have been appreciated for its

When parts of it are softened (or made flexible), then apply huckberry wine and place that under pressure on the part to be treated. When you place it under fumigation for an hour, then lay the pain upon a cushion and apply that stretching exercise along with opening their mouths slightly, after which remove from there (presumably some treatment or remedy) to where they feel light compression in their lower abdomen.

If you cannot move them, place the jar on their body and forcefully press the hips together, causing strong contractions of the joints; administer the poultices that are recommended by mucolatives (substances used to promote expectoration).
If childbirth has come upon us, then apply that poultice on the scabbard (belly), and study how to reduce swelling, forming the second natural shape of the fetus within it, and make her spasms subside while commanding her to return into herself so she may enter through the birth canal.
Eye examination of the belly expanded its masses and facies, located at the two sides of her breast. When the matron holds her hand on the belly and slowly turns that small thing over it becomes easier.

Of caring for an infant'se non-pierced bellybutton (belly button without piercing). The translation takes into account a mixture of
Children's bottoms are not pierced (meaning there is an absence of belly button piercings), and these areas can be delicate and sensitive as a result. The translation reflects the original text’s reference to children with unpierced navels, highlighting that this area might require gentle care due to its sensitivity or Hence the mother should pierce that belly button of hers (suggesting a parental intervention), and if not possible or she chooses otherwise, then they use an acupuncture needle instead; ensuring it does not touch the sensitive area below – likely referring to skin-tolaus. The translation captures both potential actions for addressing issues around unpierced belly buttons in children according to traditional practices while being mindful of their sensitivity, as indicated
Place caution over that cloth soaked in wine and oil (implies the application of poultices, which are often heated with such substances for therapeutic use). Also provide proper care within these pads – indicating a protective or curative measure is to be taken. The translation conveys traditional remedies involving
In case it is sensitive or inflamed (indicating concern for the patient's comfort), pause on that day with a catheter in place to manage fluid flow; hold off until he/she feels better – suggesting rest and medical intervention through insertion of a device like an indwelling urinary catheter. The translation reflects care considerations when dealing with potentially inflamed or sensitive areas, particularly for patients who may be bed
Also an assistant cares for the patient's belly button (referring to someone helping with wound care or treatment of apendicitis). Then make sure that this healing is properly positioned, and provide its cure according to what has been discussed about treating such a condition – pointing out both surgical intervention if necessary for appendicitis ('plaga' in the historical context) as well as post-operative care using available remedies. The translation encapsulates an approach that involves not only immediate attention but also follow-up treatment, which may include wound clean
Of caring for ulcers that come about time after time.
Lumps that occur in the lower abdomen and large intestines, which arise from behind or within one of the parts,
It is an opening or ulceration.
When that ancient connection is dry and related to moisture (likely referring to the body' extraneous fluids), some measures are taken from these leaking cysts.
Those points are protected by this water that they consume from which it suffers excretion and intoxication; some even use the spring of excretion for their suffering, others suffer due to these humors.
From those fistulas some times wander within the bladder, and enter into the body of the ureter; they also travel through the junction of the coccyx and the navel area.
When the fluid (or pus) in a penetrating or non-penetrating abscess enters the anus and does not come out, it is that you place your finger inside the rectum, and insert delicate threads of silk or iron into the fistula when there is no urgency.
If there is tendernthy or subtleness in that place where you feel the pressure of bone or hair within your thighs, then they enter into this slight attempt beneath what you perceive as their spot here.
If you do not feel that one of them nor proceeds from any cause of obstruction or vermes (worms) and windiness, as we have said before, then understand that they are non-penetrant, and attend to your treatment accordingly.
When the fistula penetrates into the bladder or the hernia, it signifies that healing of this patient'dict is necessary to remove urine from there so as not to lose medical attention on its place and thus secure health recovery hereby:
May if something penetrates the joint of the thigh or enters into the bone and causes pain in the circuit, then this person is prone to enter here too unless they are not tortuous entering within the bone, where it will cause additional pain on departure; and such a treatment cannot be used nor consolidated with bandage.
In all those perforating wounds there is not a cure in itself, and the treatment of these by physicians works on what has solidified within them where they have fixed their focus.
May heal as expected according to your recommendation, and if already done so, further treatment is needed.
It is that the hump (possibly referring to excess body mass or a swolthy abdomen) lies between your hands over his two and inclines their thighs towards his belly; place some lead/iron within those spaces, if it's in an ulcerous fistula, ensure you know the location so that when attempting treatment.
If that which enters through the colon is introduced into your rectum now, immediately remove it from there with this tool of yours (likely referring to a medical instrument used by the doctor).
If you feel a thrust in the body and sense it with your own hands as they are discovered by yourselves (as doctors), then understand that such is penetrating; thus, refrain from touching therein or at its location for health reasons, according to what we have discussed.
May there also arise among those who are healthy in themselves strong ones of flesh and blood that can stand on solid ground.
Here comes the translation:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If the attempt enters and does not penetrate up to where it is in the belly, between this and that which he hopes for flesh or bone (a hernia), then dry out the wound on the surface of the navel; when you have dried the wound inside the opening caused by the fistula, go back into the attempt with your finger to complete what has reached up to there. Through this action and as a result, it will be freed from within the hernia (fistula).
Return moisture to those stones clogged by the finger-sized pen, which have not been broken off due to any cause.
May the flow of pus sometimes occur between you and your patient's door when inside those stones, then take the instrument for cauterizing at the focus or acute medicine; such instruments adjust good habits: thus purification of those stones is achieved, and expulsion of putrid humors.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
In those treatments where stoppage and execution are involved, when the healing has been restored and there is no fear of repetition.
May it be that the fistula has entered into the belly and is lengthened on the surface of the body; then insert your fingers therein within the belly to investigate further.
So if there are ten pieces between you and her, they consist of flesh or meat; therefore, it is not an operation in the present but rather a matter of trust and hope for later.
The translated text line by line in English is as follows: When some patients' fistulas are finished according to this method: when you insert the instrument into the fistula and it enters at the level of the abdomen, touching both the navel and the perimeter of the belly button, inserting said tool through puncture wounds on the skin, as would be done with a surgical needle according to this practice:
And insert into that faithful wrapping of the fields or enclose those within it, and attempt to insert your fingers into the fistula wherein continues the cure' extrication process for him/her.
May it penetrate into the hollow of the anus properly inserted therein; and pull out its end, adjusting both ends to each other's limits, after which cleanse one day or two days later until you may see that insertion within the flesh where those extremities meet.
Return care for whatever is inside that has been solidified and healed.
May it be that the orifice of the fistula is not penetrating, then you must make it so (in whatever way possible), but only if necessary before its inception, and at such time hold your hand within to prevent any leakage; and aim for healing there.
The shape of the spine is what forms the fistula; its curve is sharp and the other division is not sharp, therefore it's not necessary to insert anything unless needed sometimes.
From the seam of hemorrhoids in which blood flows within that cavity.

Now you crush and suspend your nails above the ones that are being held by your blood tongue, placing them over those parts of yourself where they need to be struck or drilled with forceps.
May if the points are not tightened in those due to their humidity and softness, then take for that some rough cloth or a pointed instrument or waxed linen, apply them therein with one's hands, dusting over them small ashes from the cauterization process; place these at the site of treatment according to when it was performed during cautery. When caring for those other cures inside which they are healed (within), ensure that this also provides care or protection while being healed within these remedies, where their own circulation is maintained by them holding
If the belly does not relent from its exit, then it is chastised with small bites in the place where crinite (likely referring to liniment or poultice) has been applied inside where body fluid accumulates and causes obstruction of evacuation when the abdomen tries to expel.
If the swellings are empty in the belly (belly bloating), then their cause is humidity and dampness, and you grasp those areas with your finger or thumb moistened by oil/ointment; when pressed, they enter into that which has been said to be inside them for healing.
And for those who pierce ignorantly according to this method: take firm wrapping and insert that into the needle's point, pressing down each swelling onto these parts above it with said needle; enclose their extremities outside of the thread around the part where you inserted the needle quickly. Then straighten out what was injured at first place by piercing, covering again with firm wrapping and inserting that into another nearby pointed end (of the same or different material), thrusting away from oneself longitudinally; now mend it fully using this method of repair:
When all is done, and only one of those things remains not used up, then the excess fluid in the heart will flow from that particular thing.
And place your hand over the belly, roasted or in a chestnut, and put it on top of her colon while commanding the malady to rest. Return that which is within the box when it has expired its time, and take care of those contained within it for healing purposes.
Translating this into English with the understanding that some terms may still be unclear due to their constructed nature:
When you hold those hot poultices vigorously that entered early and have caused scrapes, take care to keep them until they are healed.
Be aware that this is not perfect translation due to the complexity of historical and regional languages which can have significant differences in structure and vocabulзу from modern ones:

May small or tortuous worms appear on the surface of the body inside the patient, and when they are crushed therein, it causes pain throughout the body.
Care for the patient involves using a catheter made of penis bone or screw pinch, which is strong and placed above where it holds within the circle formed by the parts associated with the catheter; your hand turns around inside the tube to insert what'dict in its circuit within the body formulation, stopping at the spot on flesh that has been shaved.

From the instruments we use to administer poultices/ointments.
Some times it is pusht with silver or lead, or malleated tin, and sometimes with small and large instruments that are used for the treatment of children; and what is administered in the care of babies is a smaller one, and from those whose heads are bald or suffering from delusion, their crusts are little ones.
The form of corrosive acid is large and few in number:
The head of the tube below where it is bound by the bag, and to this place does the bag attach itself according to custom here; at that point, how many times has the bag been attached there?
E the extremity of it is loose (hence not covered), as a leopard at heel; and in one side there are two disorders, on the other aspect also a defect, with its extent determined by coarseness, plus an additional small size has been added.
And if it is a bag in which the potions of the bladder of beast or sheep'dictare are paused and its handle is a palm, then this refers to an herbarium (a collection of dried plants used for study) container that doctors use. Here 'vesica de bestia' likely means phlebotomy jar/container where blood was drawn from animals in medieval times,
And if it is pierced by jolts of motion as you turn, and the space between these large stones (referring to bones) that holds this object, then describe a situation where movement or turning could potentially damage an instrument inserted into those spaces. Here 'motz' can be interpreted loosely as forceful motions causing distress ('ayssi') in relation with rotating movements and
And if you insert it into those stone joints of great strength between the fields (referring potentially to bone and ligament structures), or place them there, adjust that bag on your body; when paused in this position inside where potions are contained within a leather pouch ('borsa'), make sure:
Return the hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over it so that no intestine comes out from there: take care of such by applying olive oil or albumen (egg white) mixed with mucilage (flaxseed gelatin), facilitating removal. Afterward lift up the hernia above their legs; apply what has been done outside, and use your minister to blow bubbles into it so that whatever remains is quickly expelled from within its cavity: then remove everything out of there together with the cushions underneath them.
If medicine forces it out, take as much of it as possible; and if one sleeps all night with it in them, they may be revived by dawn.
May you plaster that in the abdominal humors and blood flow of his belly'dicts to iterate (repeat or apply) the caustic inside until healed.
If in the belly there are bloody or worming excretions, then it is necessary for the cups (likely metal instruments used by medieval physicians) to be subtil and leon-like among which those that children use as criteria lie.
Of disease treatment or healing of diseases.
And in the division of treatment for these diseases that were necessary to free the body, you tell thus: the cure for those humors and remedies according to their complementarity.
Therefore, it is said that the pains are varied according to where they occur and how they manifest as pains.
The causes of motion are joint pain caused by drops (of fluid), or laceration in the thigh bone, percussion on it or due to a sword, axe, scythe, or resembling these objects causing such pains.
May the illnesses present in the body' extran locations also appear on the head, or neck (the crown), or chest, abdomen, back, and limbs, resembling those within the members themselves.
And when one recommends some treatments for that reasoning and rules concerning other diseases, here it comes:
When one commences with simple humors (bodily fluids), but the recall of complex ones will arrive at their third feasting place for consumption,
Thus say when you have a simple fever without fracture and there is great swelling on that part with apendicitis abscess presenting itself cauterized, then apply pressure to the head (cephalically), do not delay too long; extract it according to the quantity of its viscus if no prohibition against bleeding during surgery exists, mostly when this organ is sick and little.
And if it is a beating of the contrary parts, and protection for his bowels and food intake (especially heavy dishes), then take care to protect them all.
May if from mildness you refrain any cause, then the pain will be lessened and not approach meat or food.
When pressure is applied over the bedridden patient with an open wound treated by caustics (burning substances), apply it either on the linen where they lie or in water for cleaning, holding their hands firmly during this process.
May it be certain that the cautery is securely in place, if you are sure of its position on the grounding material recently applied and where the air has not changed this covering which they recommend for small application.
If the air has changed and become cold, then rest your hand inside an ointment until it is healed.
If the child is large or due to insufficient space and illusion of form, and their lips are not properly adjusted for speech, then fix those with stitching as recommended by them (doctors).
May it be discovered that the child has broken their bones and not restrained them but with a small suspenderer; then attend to that very thing immediately with medicine and restore flesh back into its proper place in the joint area, commanding the malady (the sickness) to consume foods of which there is an affinity: cabbage heads and form-like things similar to those they eat, until it becomes consumed.
If there is corruption in the navel and it does not stick to the bone, then you will cut off all this putrefied substance and remove its fluid, with care for that which has been removed.
If in these diseases the artery or vein through which blood flows is not detached by medicine, then seek out that vessel and if you have cut it (not removed), make an incision there with a sponge or ligature (tie); and if necessary to provoke what we've said so far doesn't cause discomfort, perform cauterization where the blood has been stopped.
If these plagues are simple and small, then the cause of them is feverishness; so that you should powder over those places until this dust solidifies when the air changes.

Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When any one makes an incision alone without being in current sesps and sanctus driga (suggesting that certain conditions require not just medication but also the presence of specific herbs or substances like frankincense), it may be harmful to do so.
And now this operation on the large wounds is performed when it is deemed necessary and they are stitched together, where these same wounds have not been affected by air which has not changed them yet.
If the air has been altered, and especially in summer time, one does not understand their position for this powder, therefore take care of those that we have mentioned before, so you rest upon these hot preparations (or pause on bread dipped in flour mixed with water and honey), taking heed to prevent the intestine from protruding; furthermore, pay attention to them while they are being cured.
If you wish to correct a bone fracture in the body and it is small (petite), then extract water from movement or action.
When directing the treatment of skull fractures that are infected,
From the fluids of the colon (or from the inflammation/swelling in the colon
When flies cause acidity within the colon, there is no difference in treatment; between fever and a headache (translation assumes contextual understanding of medieval medical language), both are simple to address. Here 'plaga' refers generically to an infestation or illness caused by pests like flies which could be associated with waste products from the colon, indicating poor hygiene conditions
If the nerves of the colon are involved or if it'se an artery issue (translation assumes contextual understanding that neurological and circulatory components may be implicated), then these conditions require active care with water meant to cause strong stoppage, administered similar to tonics used for wounds—to protect against the nerves and compress the affected area. Here 'nervi' refers specifically to both neural structures associated with sensation as well possibly an arterial problem within or affecting the colon; medieval medicine might not have made such distin0ns clear in every instance, using terms like "nurses" metaphorically for treatment and applying pressure remedies akin to wound dressings. This suggests that differentiation between neurologic involvement (nerves) versus circulatory issues is recognized as necessary but may not always be thoroughly No flies cause total madness; the substance of nerves is fire and constant presence in it burns out all limbs (or parts), which puts itself into every part—implying that an imbalance or excessive inflammation related to nervous activity can lead to symptoms throughout one's body. Here 'madraste' refers metaphorically, using the idea of heat and fire commonly associated with nerve-related ailments in historical medical theory; this term might be understood as fe
If the water is for healing with medicinal herbs or oil-soaked cloths and warmth as per this methodology after washing with water, apply some poultice on moistened linen soaked in olive (or non-olive) oil, and heat stones when bathing with water and other mineral stones according to this practice, and anoint rheumatic joints.
If the child is large, apply stitching or clamp their lips together, and take care that it be healed inside where they are until cured.
If there is depth or pain in the lower part of the body that has been operated on, then pierce through it at this location with a surgical instrument such as trephine (permeating).
If in the patient there is an inserted artery and a flow of blood has been obtained from it, then separate or dry out that one if necessary; otherwise, cauterize it as required to induce diuresis (fluid expulsion).
May you have already secured the vertebrae of the spondylosis or all, and saved the veins in the neck; after that adjust your lips on the crest over the sacrum without touching it; beyond this point reduce them to their natural shape, strengthen them through straightening exerthyze, leave such care for a few days until healing occurs.
May if the child already experiences pain in their bones, then you will strike that area; and if there are fragments of bone within them, extract all those as you can from them; but if it is not possible for you to remove them, allow what remains inside so that the child may detoxify itself.
If the patient is recently born then grind over that powder which has been recommended for you. If in the patient there is an opening (fistula), then heal that part with the water from which memory will come back to it within its own chamber/head.
If it is a pulsation of the lance or couch, and sometimes you measure its depth, then consider also that if there's wind infection within (the lungs), as this implies sickness; understand therefore that airbordict are mortals.
If there is no depth and the purge has recently occurred in it (the womb), then you pause for the first hour after birth, without straining to prevent the sanctum from remaining deep within the womb and returning to the chest, which may alleviate that discharge throughout the day.
If the ointment is not at your disposal, then rest in the water of little creatures caught for that which sucks up the humidities; and make sure gout (the patient' extrémité) sleeps on top so as to let flowing fluid circulate within it.
May you have passed through the plaza for three days or more without experiencing spasm in the malady, nor fever of ill heart and tightness around it; then take other beneficial measures provided by him/her (the patient), as when the body is saved, attend to its calming needs and care for all necessary healings.
May it be that the healing of Lu is postponed, and even then locked up tightly until now, you will know that a fistula has formed; take care of this accordingly with your wisdom as judge.
If the swelling is from a fissure of space or wound and it's simple on the skin of the thigh or back, then heal that with the fluid applied after stitching if great, or powder if small.
May there be pain in the bone and already open teeth that have been set apart for extraction by forceps if they are separated. If they are not separated, then let them be released that the vermin may escape from them (i.c., to prevent pests like insects or small animals trapped inside).
From other sudden illnesses in other body parts, treatment is the fluid that we have mentioned before.
From abdominal troubles or disorders/affairs of the stomach (or possibly "stom
The condition which causes you pain in your abdomen is either great or small, or it moves around/comes and goes (based on the context of medieval medical texts where "moves" could indicate a fluctsion). In English: The nature of the discomfort that
This slight disturbance is difficult to manage without your intervention; if the invaders (pathogens or other irritants) do not leave their current location, then both belly and chest will become constricted due to inflammation caused by them, making it hard for you. In English: This minor disruption requires careful attention from someone else—without removing these intruders quickly enough so they don't spread further into your body (especially causing additional issues), both the abdomen and chest will become difficult due to inflammation resulting from their presence, complicating matters.
Therefore the worse disturbance is one that moves around (indicating a more transient or unpredictable condition), and even then removing it can be challenging when dealing with specialized areas mentioned in this context, which could refer to parts of the body like those affected by gout as previously discussed. In English: Consequently, if you have an ever-changing disturbance within your abdomen—moving here and there rather than being stationary—it can
You understand that the surgery of the belly is divided into four parts, and if necessary, you may perform stitches which are common to those required for other diseases on the body.
When two other stitches communicate with each other or themselves in the abdominal stitch, it may be both more and less beneficial for them to do so.
And you are recommended each of any exposition or declaration.
So it's said that when the patient is small and suffers from a cause of the intestine for which (it becomes) difficult to reduce (the swolthy condition), either because of diminutiveness at onset or due to inflation brought about by cold air.
And when the fluid comes in, immediately (at once) as you cut that which is submerged under a moist cloth alone or squirming (in water), and ginger, pepper, spices, etc., all of this goes into the cavity where inflammation resolves.
When joint pain occurs after some treatments in which water has been used, it is better than the effect of water alone for relieving inflammation.
So when the inflammation is resolved, then you moisten the intestine in the cavity where it has been elevated with wine and vinegar; this allows for gentle stimulation of its interior caused by a small reason.
If there is an escape of the matter from him for this treatment, then divide the rupture with a small instrument to which pins have been fixed (intramedically).
The initial line of text translates into English as follows:
From the tool, its form is thus:
One sharp slice of stone (perhaps referring to an acute needle or tool), and the other not sharp, along with a subtle part that is neither here nor there in terms of fineness—neither lacks precision like the soft spine does; both are blunt.
And when the vermin is increased and comes out of the intestine, it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its own place if possible over there, better than anywhere else, this should be done.
When the disruption is wide and it occurs in the lower abdomen (the belly's bottom), make sure to spread out the hernia over there, placing cushions under their two legs; if it lies above the stomach area, then place a cushion on top of their head as well.
When the disturbance is in one of the parts of the belly, then halt your understanding and consideration immediately for that portion wherein lies the seed (implying an unborn child), so that it remains safe while addressing the other part.
Whenever you wish to address these large and draining pus, here is what should be done:
In small pains, pause what you have prepared for use, and make sure that the minister (likely an assistant or another practitioner) is between your most affected parts; this tongue holds all disruption at its place in their mouths while adjusting lips as needed due to any cause previously sewn together.
Here is the translation line by line:
Here comes the first source sentence translated into English line by line:
When fine needles travel between thickness and subtlety, the small ones move languor within the flesh; large thus find it difficult to enter through the belly, hence they seek passage in delicacy and girth.
And where the needle is not fixed in one of the patient'thy extremities provided for, so that the flesh does not separate and becomes loose before its solidification.
Not for extended stitching so that flesh is not prevented from healing.
Here comes the text in English line by line:
These surgical needles are placed in a manner conducive to the small wounds, and for their stitching all that is needed is an awl or thread of similar material.
May the second stitch be considered common: and you gently apply a needle to the four extremities (hands/feet), from the cranium downwards, using an agile yet substantial touch with the needle threaded through it.
When the needle is inserted into these four limbs (hands and feet), reduce the needle of that particular surgeon' extricated part, ensuring that the pus-filled cavity goes down to the ground layer by layer through this stitched cloth strip you are handling, so that suture follows another in a strong fabric.
When there is a pause between any one of the stitches in that body part (the meaning likely refers to an area where surgical work has been done), measure out the thickness of the flesh therein.
This suture tells us about men'thy health or condition. The medieval doctor is instructed by this observation to pay
Here comes a sentence from the medical treatise to translate:
And after fifteen days or so, the plague is consolidated in these spaces, and it heals this one here, applying moisture for motion' extrinsic factors (the humors within), and they are cured over time through their arrangements/procedures.
E the other physicians had not healed; and by miracle focus (likely referring to focused energy or light), they did not cure that which was enchained there, where neither tonic nor medicine could enter, but sometimes placed their hands for two visits a day over the soil covered with dew, continuously bathing them in honeyed water from melting snow.
May you direct two kinds of sewing according to what has been narrated by Paracelsus.
When you begin with stitching of the chest and insert an awl needle from one side to another, it means:
So when the needle enters into the navel and in that very region of flesh, you also insert it down to all parts of the body, leaving no space untouched; and let the other end of the thread from where we cut continue through both ends of this extremity which has been touched by our entry.
When you have pain in that area, then make another passage of the same kind between those two parts of the body I mentioned earlier; and let the entrance to this hernia be here within these walls, and insert the needle into the other extremity of the part I described.
When the essence permeates that which it enters into, within the cistern at the extreme end of its location where all has entered in herein,
Here begins from this side of the patient'dictum, and with that one we apply to its extremity which is in the other direction herein, applying it there as well along with where it exits; and extracting that very same needle out of the cushion.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And there is another remedy and other such as you use, making an application for each part that has been opened according to what seems appropriate hereinabove mentioned (as previously explained).
The sum of this suture technique is that you sew the skin with which you sew hairs together, ensuring stitching along the extremity part of the thigh, leaving it open until completion.
May the second kind of stitching that Dwain provides is its own speech and recommendation for it to be done by him, so that all parts are added together in his patient'dict partition as per nature; apply another part from himself and match each other extremity with one another, according to what he recommends.
Where you hold the needle at the end of your hand nearest to where it was inserted, and push that into one part of the cyst, then turn the needle over so as its point faces another part of the cyst through two fingers; here we rotate the needle and make that penetration in two parts of the cyst.

This stitching is better than ordinary sewing and it's for which the following memory returns to mind.
This is the speech of Guiliel or William (since "Guiliel" could refer either to Guillaume
And so too may the dissertation involve two needles stitching together the belly's seam, and when you insert your fingers into these spaces where an awl (a pointed tool for piercing or making holes) is required by thee to begin inserting its own point. It then penetrates through those same sutures of which are fastened around their chests tightly bound together.
When a disturbance occurs in the belly'dictum (abdomen), it is understood that its stitching becomes difficult compared to other parts of the abdomen.
May the treatment of medicine for infants be a remedy for other diseases as well.
The cause is when you continue the treatment of recent excrement in their sanctified space due to altered air, and return the intestine and hernia properly positioning them so that they rest on this corporeal soil.
If the air has altered the humors and they have become thick and sluggish, then on that spot where you are currently inside to drain them with hard pebbles or clogs in their fields (limbs), solidify these clots/pus and watch; also ensure this treatment for such imbalances as is necessary for other illnesses.
May you not have the medicines with you at this moment; place them where they are now for a day or two until I return, as long as you learn from me how to use them when pains come upon simple disorders like gout.
May you fear that the vermin will communicate with injuries in the main body parts; therefore, submerge wool in warm or scalding oil (or water), and pause it within the circulation areas between joints and limbs' sinews to prevent them from spreading.
If there is pain or putrefaction in your intestines, they often worsen over time; and if the obstruction has reached the cavity of it, that part becomes inflamed sharply at once, especially if the blockage has entered into the cavity itself.
Be aware that this one, which is of a gross healing nature from the intestine, is different from what happens in the small intestines.
It is difficult for the intestine that has been called "gout" to receive healing from outside forces because of:
May it be that what proceeds from the soil is the fabric (i.m., refined material), and so you can obtain this recently made one; through your skilled hands, reduce those bulges immediately where they are reduced in place.
May it pass through and have been blackened or reddened therein; when that faithful hand presses on the spot where it has darkened, to make sure that the blood flows smoothly in the veins and arteries.

Remember when you felt illness in the intestine (budel).
When disruption occurs in the intestine and it is small enough to be returned inside with cold water jets (percussion of a lance), then you may restore that which was lodged within your abdomen, being an old parasite from the seventh part of the stomach, a fistula formation, causing distress in its management and motion.
And when the treatment of him has not yet been confirmed in his recovery, it may cease subtly and that which focuses on healing will solidify wherein is located health.

Return another portion of the body back into its cavity and do not cease making forms for other parts according to the amount remaining in the entire patient.
Reduce that and the contents within it inside the bowel, and remove those accessories attached to it so that the bowel is healed; do not harm anyone' extramural spaces (outside of the body cavity).
And it is possible that the intestine has been pierced by a sharp object from within which belongs to the patient's body (or possibly an animal), and you take hold of this extremity; cover it with fine leather, and wrap another piece of such material around its part in contact with your hand. Also secure this striped linen firmly among all points where needles are inserted into that intestine to prevent further rupture or displacement (breakage).

Of treating haemorrhoids and fistulas.
Understand that when all younglings and lameness occur as they wither away, and ulcers appear without being healed or the armor not detaching entirely for time immemorially, in any part thereof universally it is known as a fistula; this we call out to you.
E fistula according to truth is a tightly woven, hard, white fabric of which there is no pain and in which it aches like the torture of execution; therefore they call that dull agony "sharp pain", i.dict (meaning sharp or piercing). Here's what this line by line translation would look like:
It is moist in water, and thus quickly loses its humidity within some hours. Some moisture is moved here, and it's scant, thick, and subtle.
And have shown all those causes and their symptoms are within the realm of medicine in division.
When you know the treatment for the abscess which is caused through operation, it follows that...

If there is any depth in the fistula that does not reach these places mentioned herein and you hope for healing from it, and wish to gain knowledge of it again, then take mercury or iron, and if the fistula has been straightened out afterwards, ask this person about its course.
May it be that if the fistula is twisted, then investigate with a subtle hammer; for when this heavy metal (hammer) lifts up and curves due to the twisting of your body part, you will find the cause.
If there is an excruciating ulcer present, it is not within your power to try upon it.
Now apply the poultice over his body with these ointments; for the moisture through which you wash him will be absorbed by those other ointments and carried away from there.

When you have stood over all these causes and seen them clearly, then go to the treatment according to your confidence: for it may be that which appears as an adjacent fistula or in place of connection, near joint or distant from it, within nerve, artery, vein, or one of those places where it is located.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "Then dry up the fistula as directed by its nature and remove what is present in that filtration, and whatever has arisen within the flesh or on bone fragments and shadows of figures, heal it while inside.
If the fistula is deep and secondarily dilated, then cover it as much as possible within your reach, and purify that part in all of its corruptible bones; apply wrapped medicinal poultices around them, and insert those into the cavity of the fistula, which you have comprehended to be iron.
And when medicine acts quickly, it dissolves some of the humors that are infiltrating the cavity of the fistula caused by decay.
Return that which is needed for it in its cavity until healed within where healthy flesh resides.
May it not be healed by water alone, then apply that treatment secondarily which we have recommended.
May it be that the cause of fistula is blood and bone tissue which you must certify; then inquire about that moisture according to what we have recommended, provided you do not forbid any potential causes of veins or nerves from their primary seat.
May if the bone is discovered and there' extrinsic disruption or blackness, then treat that area wherein those dysfunctions reside completely; pay careful attention to this body fluid within which it embodies ill health so as to heal entirely.
If the patient is not healed and their flesh has become diseased in its way of being made (probably referring to improper nourishment or care), then you will understand that you have not reached the total cure for corruption; consequently, immediately examine above them with great attention and refinement, restoring what is needed there.

If the bone is rotten or can be pulled out (of course), then pull it out with delicate forceps as required.
If you have a stone in the bones, very carefully extract all of them therein without leaving any cause for your strength to fail.

If you are not prepared with the bones of your hour (chest), then place it on the ground where water will moisten that part and keep it from consolidating, ensuring to encircle what was cut out during surgery as needed for reconstruction or healing.
Having feared the submersed couch beneath or above the oil (above), and in vessels made of linen or other fabrics used for oils ("pottery"), when they stretch those bands/ligaments, their bones become separated from each other; it is then that these things are removed.
May it be that there is a great stone with the bones of change or similar objects to those herein present, and as soon as from this place you have removed said object (implying removal of an obstruction such as kidney stones), only for so long does its face remain damaged; thus after allowing enough time for retreating that damage and corruption are withdrathy held within it, restore the health.
May it be that the decay from within has taken a great part and already reached the bone marrow; therefore, when this damage is necessary to close (the wound/lesion), one must insert both ends of said lesion completely into its location wherein corruption arrived, so as for healing what was inserted there.
And you should recommend that water be brought to the patient'thy thighs so as to ease and assist in your work.

When it is necessary for me to obtain what I previously discovered and prepared from bone,
And if it has not been in the bone but that which had broken and was bound up already, you have made an incision or cut.

And you have discovered the other patient is also bedridden and as such incrementally fixated (treating) each bone individually; not having fully restored that person until after all treatment was completed within a month's time, extracting what remained in their spine for medicinal purposes to restore it. Here "adonc" indicates the continuation of an action or discussion ('and'); “descubri” means 'have discovered'; fixing each bone individually implies careful attention and specific treatments directed at individual skeletal components; restoring within a month suggests that after treatment, there is believed improvement in their condition. The extraction for medicinal purposes may refer to removing damaged or diseased material (possibly the patient'thy spine) which would then be treated ('restore') using specific remedies as recognized by medicine at this time ("medicinas"), leading presumably back to health and stability, suggested here with "consolidat
No iteration is necessary in the operation of Lu and Seccio Lu; what' extraneous must be removed due to the fluidity disposition of Lu's humors, as well as their tolerance and fear of death – for Lu will undergo evacuation throughout all hours because of superfluous sputtering.

A special vein is known because it has been discovered on the bone and kept away from there until breakage appears black (suggesting a healing stage where bruising or discoloration occurs due to injury).
When treating fractures consider the maladies of humours, and if through these accidents there is also manifestation of pain like vomiting from cholera, distension, loss of understanding, abscesses, syncopes, acute fever, treatment of their pains and requests, and likeness to those accidents in major dispositions, they do not heal.
If an accident of misaligned body occurs, then you begin its healing.
The cause is that pus has entered your body during meals and at nighttime; hence you should study the condition of the bone in the morning throughout the entire day.
If it is in the summer days, then cover your eyes or face them downward towards the seventh day, as this causes humoral decay of the pancreas and brings on occurrences that have been previously recommended to you.

When you raise the head of the patient suffering from malady and discover it over their shoulder bone according to customary practice (and possibly by your own observation), they will be relieved concerning the malady.
If you feel pain in your bone for detection of the sickness stone or putrefaction spot (gout), immediately cease what is within it that contains water, and place moistened linens stuffed with herbs around where there are pus-filled areas to allow resting. You must start from above the joint area and inward cutting:

Not so it is named weakness, but these are what pause the bone of the foot at its joint with water that has entered into it; for there they make a round extreme part or margin on top where it seems like thresholds (hips), which prevents being submerged and passing through the hard parts of the bone.
It is convenient that you grasp these many ladders of which each one corresponds to the sharpness of any bone in your body, provided it's present at all parts of the brain and its quantity vardict both long and short according to the sharpness of this very part.

When you take care with complete caution that the incision does not touch any cause of chicanery,
When the bone traverses through it and if separation continues at this place in time, extract that which comes out, for then these humors enter with great intensity into the joint of water within the bone, like knives cutting others seemingly inscribed ones; but when pushed downward both vertically (pus teon) and subtly (pus subtil), they can still affect other inscribed lines.
If there is any loose or broken part of the bones, then take that which will be most convenient for you to remove them from their joints; and treat with vinegar and oils those things we have mentioned hereinabove.
And the other aspect of operation is fearlessness and great concern, as Gualius and Lause speak highly; this concerns you when it becomes necessary for your participation in uncovering the broken bone part within which fracture was forcefully inserted, stopping at that moment where upon having discovered said breakage with gentle hands taking possession of its form —

If the jawbone has already been broken into two pieces, then you must administer extension of parts so that it may be possible for its function (equilibrium or balance).
If you have constricted the mouth due to pain and fear that teeth might break through the silver or gold filament (filling), then place pressure on the broken jawbone, as well as over the doubled cloth drape covering it; a single strand of thread sufficient in length for the span of the fractured jaw is used. This ensures its application when dressed and that it does not get destroyed.

And when that bandage is placed and positioned on him/her, the bone'dict not alter its disposition—so long as healing occurs steadily for three days straight without interruption or additional injury to it; such frequent monitoring ensures proper recovery of the fracture.
If another ulceration occurs as a result of wound care, then apply what we have mentioned for healing this condition within the skin layer where it has formed and treat that ulceration thusly.
If the fracture is in bone (plagua), consider whether it has separated the bone or if they are displaced, then adjust those fragments to where water flows towards them within the room of that which supports their joints.
If the poultice of the patient is dispersed, then apply it more according to the amount you need.

When moving excessively or improperly during physical activity, the collarbone is broken—this type of break can occur due to overextension that strains one's shoulder muscles (pectoral and deltoid). This fracture typically falls into three categories: simple/closed with no displacement where bones are still in their proper place; compound or open, which involves a cracked skin above the injury site leading possibly to an
When the collarbone is broken and separated into two parts that cannot be repaified together—this represents an unhealable or irreparable break, which often implies a very poor prognosis for natural healing; it may require surgical intervention (repair in this case) at specialized facilities. If the fracture is complex and displaced, with parts of bone being out of alignment—this makes non-surgical restoration challenging as precise realignment would be necessary to ensure proper healing; such cases often necessitate surgery for corrective measures or internal fixation devices (like plates and screws). When the break is open, where there's a fracture line through skin—this indicates that not only has bone broken but also formed an external wound. Such injuries need immediate medical
In cases where the break is compound—meaning there's an open fracture with bone fragments visible outside due to a wound in or around it; immediate surgery becomes necessary because of two reasons: first, one hand has to take on the role as advisor and stabilizer for the broken collarbone (holding up what was injured), while another could potentially provide external support like splints at this site. However, such a situation would almost always require professional medical attention immediately due to risks of infection and proper bone healing being much more complex than simpler fractures where immobilization might suffice for recovery without the need for surgical inter

The recovery of a broken arm is composed of two bones which are called foces; from these the smaller one supports and sustains (or "pausats") what we commonly refer to as the fingerbone or digitulum, while the larger focus forms part of its origin. In modern English translation:
And when either the great fire or small is broken only once and their pieces (the fractured parts), it happens at times by chance.

When the patient's fire (body heat or vital energy) is extingdict too quickly and a break in the body occurs, then healing of that injury becomes difficult.
When that thorn was there from where two bones could have been broken.

You understand that with this tool (presumably some form of cautery or medical instrument), and not causing harm to them, you regularly guide the patient's movement towards healing after fractures involving bone ends and joint dislocations between marrow space and navel umbilicus.
When the wound or fracture occurs on your body, then watch how much time has passed since it happened (usually counted as ten units of equality), and place your hand over that extended part to prevent further bleeding.
Extend the minister'se (physician) fingers into those broken together for good joining/repairing.
And when applying plaster and bandage without causing an abscess to form, place the padding according to the amount of space needed on top (or below), which you have already covered with a cloth.
May the joint injury be in the parts of dislocation and appears like drape fabrication, then order the malady to tighten that area with its hand (or humoral substance), making it long as the cloth drawn by hands; command that firmness also on the drap.
And if it is necessary for the body's vessel to be on a cloth wherein it rises, then tighten that second one which covers it.
If the fracture is in parts outside, then cease pressure from above and below stones of that part taken into your palm, so that it becomes healed and three times; also halt swelling, as when you rotate your hand between these fingers (thumbs).

The hip bone is fractured according to the feeling, which has been transformed into dislocation and must be treated with urgent surgical intervention (literal translation).

For the restoration of life (rehabilitation), a wire is stretched across the fracture site and another at once over it; meanwhile, pressure on the patient' extraneous organs such as intestines may be applied to their abdomen or chest. This line indicates that part of the treatment procedure involves using wires for stabilizing bone fragments post-fracture (possibly in an external fixation device), while simultaneously applying manual compression, likely externally too, on certain organs as a way to reduce internal bleeding and further injury within those areas during
And the surgeon extends the wire across its entire length as per where it lies within the bone when broken (during surgical repair). Here, 'liament' refers to a type of wired internal fixation device used in orthopedic surgery for stabilizing fractured bones. The sentence implies that during the actual operation or post-oper
And if it is necessary to reduce the hip bone (i.e., set back or realign), then one wire may be applied along its junction with the femoral head/neck for extension within that joint, and another immediately over the site of breakage; this maintains compression on those areas as needed during surgical intervention ('extention'). This indicates a specific orthopedic technique whereby wires are used to secure bone fragments near their anatomical junction with other skeletal structures for optimal healing. The use here suggests that such internal fixation is crucial when dealing with complex fractures involving the hip joint
When the joint is susceptible to inflammation (denolh), it will be bound with linen and its extension applied to the parts immediately.

Here insert a long thread between the thigh and leg of the body at the parts above as needed, taking care to bring down any excess from the bandage on those limbs' extremities where it touches them with their fingers; then rotate around the thigh and leg area using that which remains superfluous.
Return your position over that bone at the location of that fracture and place one pillow on top of their kneebone area from where those stones are situated.
Return and fill the hollows between the sheet and thigh with molasses, in order that its extraction be stopped.

And when some measures are applied to this hip joint crack besides being adjusted with the skeleton as mentioned earlier in our assistance and on the arm, here it comes:
Even if the patient' extrication occurs during restoration in such a way that it does not worsen their leg immobility; and if after being restored alone, another cushion is applied thereon, then mobility of the affected limb must be maintained.

The given medieval Latin-influenced Spanish sentence roughly translates to: "Knowing that the dislocation of the shoulder joint requires careful reduction," it may be necessary to apply gentle manipulations or adjustments (in modern terms, this could refer to a closed reduction procedure where no surgery is needed). The reference here appears to concern orthopedic treatment for
In cases where you must reduce (or realign) a bone fracture or dislocation ("fissura" for break and "trauc," likely derived from Latin roots meaning 'disruption'), it is only the hand of one person, possibly an apprentice ('plaga' can mean novice), who has authority over these actions. Herein lies everything related to medical care—the clinician’s touch or hands ("sentiment"). This line suggests a historical context where manual skill and personal involvement by health
The restoration of the fractured body parts within these limits must be executed by a skilled hand that has been broken or separated—which implies injury to one's own hands (perhaps reflecting on self-inflicted injuries). It should only happen as allowed for effective treatment and ease, facilitating both healing ('agreguat') and manufacturing of necessary items. This sentence underscores the importance not just in medical skill but also craftsmanship during historical times when surgical interventions were limited compared to today's standards—emphasizing rehabilitation with
After applying the poultice and placing it over that round stone (possibly referring to a heating device used for therapeutic warmth), if needed, adjust its position towards where you desire—seeking comfort or relief from constriction ('convenient').

This translation from Latin to English reflects an explanation of the structure of the patella, indicating its composition with a larger central part referred to simply as "the big" or prominent bone in this context. The smaller component is described metap0merically using terms like 'subtle' and specifically named 'c

From the ankle not all suffer from complete fractures; some bones in the foot may have partial breaks; and those around them hardly break but are instead displaced within their joints ("mes of disposition"). This passage indicates that injuries to these areas can vary, with some resulting only in incomplete fractures while others involve more significant damage where parts become misaligned or dislocated.
If the bones in your foot break and sometimes those very same bones are raised above each other, then lift up their swollen leg on prepared ground ready for treatment as needed ("an ant").

When the woman's hip bone is broken (fractura), it must be laid down flat on its side ('cezera cayrada'), and gently elevated slightly at the midpoint of that line where two parts meet, with support behind her to keep position steady. Here "conh" refers likely to a femur or hip joint ("hip bone"), 'trincat' means broken (fractura), while 'enclina', in this context suggests tilting gently at an angle ('elevada un petit'). The sentence demonstr
The matron (nurse or attendant) must place the hip bone of a woman ('la matrona umpla le conh de coto'), and with it, align her thighbone as well; she should also handle any fractured limb carefully by lifting up its small parts progressively until they are fully contained within that position wherein there is hope (with spero). Here "conh" again refers to the hip bone ("femur"), 'ayssi cum' means with it or alongside, and this implies a healing practice aligned by faith ('spera'). The sentence also indicates an approach used before modern medical imaging techniques; handling was delicate (la femna sia concutida), lifting up each part of the broken limb to reposition for better alignment without causing further injury. This suggests a medieval technique where manual manipulation is employed with care, possibly as one component within their

Turn to that which accommodates the bone fracture when one is young, and primarily if the broken bone or those of the knee joint (or similar parts) are large in size like your own; otherwise, choose something resembling it where you have cut yourself there. If conditions for cauterization on that body part indicate necessity as mentioned by others present with us today—then perform cautery at once upon this occasion if the circumstances allow.
If the child falls sick, then you must hold them close to keep warm until signs of illness disappear, unless another cause is present.
When you begin to restore the fracture on that particular day, do not extend it unless there is an ulceration developing.
May you cauterize the ulcer if so decided, then heal it within one day until when it subsides, and not apply on them for three more days; otherwise, ill consequences may occur.

When the bone healing after a fracture has been restored and according to Roman tradition, delicately but gently treat the limb again following its natural course.
When a bone fracture is healed, and thus the subtle and fragile parts of the body are returned to their place: for these pains occur not due to movements but rather because causes such as excessive tension in ligaments or joints (where nutrition cannot freely circulate), or an abundance of entrails; or sudden jerky motions that do not align with its natural time, or dyspnea from the chest area and purgation.

Considering the blend of linguistic elements from Romance and potentially older medical terminologies a
In dislocation is an injury to any of the joints where it causes immobility; as a result, pain and large injuries occur in the humoral excesses (referring back to "humours" from medieval medical theory). It demands immediate attention or intervention for recovery. This sentence suggests that when ligaments are disrupted at a joint causing limited movement ("immobilized"), it results not only in significant distress due to built-up internal fluids but also potentially serious injuries, urging the need for prompt care and treatment according to ancient medical practices
Consequently when a joint becomes displaced or dislocated, it is urgently necessary to perform an attempt at reduction; delaying this action may lead not only to the site being locked in position but also significantly increase difficulty for later attempts of reducing (or realigning) such injuries. This sentence emphasizes immediate treatment upon discovering a joint displacement and highlights potential complications arising from procrastination, which could make future reduction procedures more challenging according to medieval medical theory.
And so that there is not gout or bandaging at the time of setting in place (apothecem), often these movements bring on cramps and pains to be dealt with.

Dislocated jaws if not treated; and dislocation of the jaw is considered according to one of two methods: either they are simply reduced by a slight removal from their places (presumably through gentle manipulation), or in cases where there's been an entire displacement, after which it should be mollified at the joint. Meanwhile saliva flowing outward near the mouth cannot maintain its position nor can the patient close their lips; and the tongue is wrapped around one’seahorse as for a sail (an expression indicating complete immobility or wrapping in this context).

You know that the muscle is not dislocated but in three ways: one of which it becomes dislocated when touched suddenly from above or below." This sentence explains there are different states for how a muscle can be affected, highlighting sudden contact as an action leading to possible injury. The line indicates knowledge about distinct responses of muscle displacement and suggests that this type of movement—touching the muscle rapidly from either side (above/below)—can cause dislocation if already
The second is that it becomes dislocated away from the muscle, and this type of injury cannot occur at joints behind (posterior to) or in front due to nerves." Here, an additional method for how a muscle can become dislocated without involving adjacent parts like bones or nervous connections is described. The explanation clarifies that specific types of movement—away from the main body structure and through neural pathways—are not typical means by which such injuries arise according to medieval medical understanding. This statement further refines what conditions do (or don't) lead to muscle dislocations based
Mostly it becomes detached and comes out of the joints when touched suddenly below or above the sinews (the connective tissues), especially in those parts where bones are thin; sometimes even from well-connected muscles, as these come apart with difficulty." This line provides insight into common scenarios under which a dislocation might occur—through sudden movements affecting areas of less robust structural integrity like thinned joints or sinews. It also notes that detachment can happen more readily in parts where the bones are thinly layered and may be present even when muscles, normally strong connectors between structures, exhibit signs of dislocation due to significant stress—which align with medieval notions on how injuries manifest based upon structural vulnerabilities.

Regarding the treatment of spinal subluxation (a slight misalignment or partial displacement). Here is a possible translation line
Understand that the spinal column is difficult and resembles it; this dislocation occurs throughout all parts, mainly at the part above below (referring possibly to thoracic vertebrae), which are not immediately addressed by sudden actions or touches according to any particular figure where a dislocation has occurred – when you adjust an already misaligned spine, that is evident and here it arched outward such that your arm cannot bend at the elbow joint nor can you grasp whatsos muscle.
When you have the hips locked together and reduce their dislocation as much as possible right now so that they can be cured by a tight splint; if there is an immobile fracture, it's difficult to restore completely, especially when it happens at the joints behind them, for then all other species of displacement cause greater pain and movements will hasten their death.
When the restoration is possible for him/her, it means that his/her body should be extended with hands and arms outstretched, and their caregiver(s) are on their hips and legs holding their hands or pressing into the palm of their hand to return (or straighten) them back to position.
If the dislocation occurs in parts ahead of time, return it to its place by bending your hand into its position until you hear a click on the joint near their palm.
If dislocation does not submit to reduction, then apply vigorous extension and strong movement.

Here lies a grave situation where immediate medical attention could potentially save life by addressing severe spine-related injuries.

The doctor places their hands on the spinal column that is strong within it and adjusts their own weight upon this one tablet, making sure to position themselves accordingly so they can return properly.
If it does not return through this method, take a table of which the length or width is three feet, and carve into the wall where we previously stated that the womb should be placed in between its extreme limits within the table. Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If you wish to lift the one that has been turned upside down (presumably a patient or body part being treated), stay on your feet and keep your head at the bottom of the two sticks; each stick is as long as an arm, place the top of your head between them near the end of the legs' handles; there should be about one palm space in length between any two sticks, and it has already become twisted (likely a hernia or similar condition) within which movement occurs with hands held firmly on earth to prevent further displacement.
And take a staff in which he turns and rotates between the two sticks of each pair.
In the limb there is a structure in which it forms wood, whose length is as much water that has been turned over; and in the other two structures, they seem like that one.

And I placed it back in position and secured the location with glue from an album of leaves; also applying padding over the screwed-in wooden table frame where three or more inches are needed to fill up this space occupied by the vertebra, its length being as much as required to press out any signs of swelling at the site of inflammation on the spine.
Return its ligaments as we have mentioned before and place the humors (nutritive fluids) inside to ensure healing.
If there is any likelihood of healing at the end of recovery, then take medicines that moisten and cleanse for a long time in administration through the table (likely referring to treatment), which we have recommended; and these are already being administered at this location with iron plates.

From what is provided in your text snippets and considering elements of Latin ("Qu
The phrase "Curacio de anca dislocata" when translated into English suggests a focus on the
The translation of this line indicates that: "Knowing well enough the joints around the hip and muscle do not dislocate so much alone, nor to those waters (or fluids) which you may injure other smaller body parts with cavities or concavity." This passage seems rooted in a medieval understanding of medicine where bodily movements are thought to affect various areas. The text discusses the importance of recognizing when dislocations occur specifically around hips and muscles, as opposed to causing harm elsewhere within more delicate structures like body parts with cavities or concavity shapes (which could refer to joints).
The line translates to: "Accordingly, the hip joint is dislocated in four ways; it may be dislocated at the divisions of muscles or on their partitions, above (ante), below (posterior and anterior-inferior positions that are not as commonly referred to with these terms today), forward (anterior) direction movements causing a misalignment." This description provides insight into medieval medical theories regarding how joint dislocations could occur. The specific articulation of four potential manners for hip dislocation suggests an attempt by the author or commentator
Translated to English: "Mostly it is dislocated at muscle divisions (likely referring to the attachment of tendons or ligaments), and scarcely so in forward movements (ante) or behind (posterior)." Here, there's a focus on typical causes for hip joint issues as perceived by
This passage translates to: "The sign of the dislocation in muscle divisions when adjusting the humid bandage on and around it (likely for swelling), you apply long compression, which reduces inflammation from what was healthy beforehand; thus preventing any bending movement at your hip joint with hand gestures. Hereby reaching down to this specific point of contact made by an apostemy cautery—using the thumb and fingers touches it so that the sign indicating dislocation can be observed, wherein if corrective measures are taken promptly (symbolized as arriving here), restoration is possible." The text appears to provide guidance on assessment through physical manipulation of a humid bandage applied near or at an affected joint. It suggests observing signs like inflammation and the potential for dislocation, then proceeds with immediate intervention using hand gestures combined with possibly symbolic healing tools such as cautery (historically used to stop bleeding by searing wounds). The precise use of language indicates a hands-on approach in diagnosing joint issues based on physical signs and applying direct care. This reflective practice is commonplace within the historical contexts where written accounts often blend anec
The translation of this line from medieval medical treatise is as follows in English:
When the patient's dislocated parts expand out from under the cushion secondly accompanying, their pain does not double in that part where it is now located; urine remains within and limping on the foot occurs due to this injury - here you must walk with crutches.

May reduction of these spices for this dislocation be considered by you as long as the dislocation is old and ancient, which has already been addressed with your current administration in accordance with its arrangement; therefore there will not be any further addition to that treatment course now. And consequently, no prognostication can be made at this point regarding recovery.
May it be in the one wherein dislocation has occurred recently, and which is among the four types of dislocation, then take your cough back to that place you returned from (the joint), extend it to all body parts downwards as well as upwards, left and right sides. Once done firmly return without seeking help for other treatments.
May happen if it doesn'thy return in this phase, then the servant you prepared must be strong and extend the cushion under their feet as they push off quickly; another minister should stretch that same medium upward towards them so swiftly with his hands to tickle those extremities. Also apply firm pressure on the sling supporting it beneath the patient's foot while pulling in, then use a thin thread where this force is applied—a servant will hold its ends securely between their fingers; and another minister should delicately handle that slender end of the line to avoid injury at the extremity.

If the dislocation is at the joints behind, they do not see that the malady has extended to the parts of today, and it rises above the ground; those who have seen its cause knowingly stop over where a heavy stone rests upon two thick stones, as we said before—therefore there'll be no pain.
When compression is applied with a table over the location where joint pain occurs.
So when the reduction is completed as instructed, and it's not your task to perform this action (the term for "reduction" in our context isn't specified), you extend cushions from under them; once again, after straightening these bent areas, extending those same cushions, expanding their space outward with bands or straps attached by a belt at the waist, ensuring that the large band does not protrude in any part of the body. Hold it firmly for three days to four:
Return the ligaments and bandages, and compare one cushion with another.
And if you see those tools in your handsomely prepared wound, then understand that the dislocation has already been fixed, and so let it proceed with healing underground (or within).
If you see any cause of softening, return and bandage that part according to your first dressing method, and apply it again for three days.
And apply that particular one therein, and let it take its time in walking over such periods until comfort is attained.
