Chapter thirteen on the treatment of the fissure that occurs in the upper eyelid.	CHAPTER THIRTEEN. On entropion occurring in the upper eyelid.	0.7026135
The eye that is affected by this fissure is called "hare-eye".	The eye that suffers this inversion of the lid is called 'leporine' (i.e. hareeye).	0.7288415
And this fissure is either natural or accidental.	Now sometimes this inversion is natural, sometimes acquired.	0.55922806
The accidental one results from the healing of a wound, a tear, a cauterization, or something similar.	It is acquired either from the cicatrization of an injury, or an incision, or cauterization, or the like.	0.7849226
The way to treat it is to incise that healed part and separate its edges and place between them a wick of linen and tie it until it heals.	The idea of the operation is to excise the scar, separate the edges of the wound, pack linen between them, and bandage up till healed.	0.7513952
And it is not appropriate to use in its treatment things that dry and constrict, because if you do that, the fissure will return worse than it was.	In the treatment of it you should not use anything styptic or drying, for if you do the inversion will return worse than ever before.	0.7053515
Rather, use things that soften, such as fenugreek and poultices with water in which marshmallow and flaxseed have been soaked, and diachylon ointment melted with some oil, and smear the wick with it and treat with it.	Employ relaxing substances such as fenugreek; and fomentation with water in which mallows and linseed have been boiled; and diachylon plaster which has been previously softened with one of the oils and spread on the packs; and treat it with this.	0.828895
And the key to its treatment is to strive by every means that it does not heal in the way it was originally.	The main thing in the treatment is to use every device to prevent the healing up of the place as it was before.	0.68401545
And this treatment that we mentioned is only a partial repair of the fissure, not that the appearance of the place returns exactly as it was originally.	This operation which we have described is but some correction of the inversion, not that the appearance of the place will necessarily revert to what it was.	0.75267935
