Chapter thirty-one on the treatment of dislocated hip.	CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE. On the treatment of a dislocated hip.	0.9032445
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and they are not subject to what happens to other joints of slight displacement and concavity.	You should know that a complete dislocation alone is sustained by the hip and shoulder joints; they do not sustain the lesser displacements, with concavity, as do the other joints.	0.83230895
And the hip joint dislocates in four ways, that is, it dislocates inward, outward, forward, and backward, and it most often dislocates inward, and rarely dislocates forward or backward.	Now the hip joint is dislocated in four directions, interior, exterior, posterior, and anterior. Most commonly it is dislocated interiorly; and rarely is it dislocated anteriorly or posteriorly.	0.8693104
And the sign of its dislocation inward is that if you compare the healthy leg of the patient with the diseased one, it will be longer, and the knee will be more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient will not be able to bend his leg at the groin, and the area next to the groin will be swollen, a clear swelling, because the head of the femur has gone there.	The indication of an internal dislocation is that when you compare the patient's sound leg with the injured leg it will be longer and the knee will be prominent as compared with that of the sound leg; nor will it be possible for the patient to flex the foot back on the groin; and there will be an obvious swelling near the groin because the head of the femur has moved there.	0.86052084
And the sign of that which is subject to dislocation outward is that its symptoms are the opposite of these symptoms.	The sign of the occurrence of an external dislocation: the symptoms will be the exact contrary to these.	0.7218306
And the sign of that which is subject to dislocation forward is that he extends his leg completely, except that he cannot bend it without pain being in the knee, and if he intends to walk, he cannot do so forward, and he retains his urine, and his groin swells, and when walking, his weight is on his heel.	The sign of an anterior dislocation is that the patient can stretch his leg out fully but cannot flex it without feeling pain in the knee; and if he tries to walk he will be unable to walk forward; and he has retention of the urine and his groin swells, and in walking he hobbles upon his heel.	0.8779512
And the sign of that which is subject to dislocation backward is that he does not extend the knee, and he cannot bend it before he bends the groin, and his leg is also shorter than the other, and the groin is relaxed, and the head of the femur is clearly at the position of the loin.	The sign of a posterior dislocation is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he flex it before flexing the hip; also the leg will be shorter than the other, the groin will be relaxed, and the head of the femur will be evident at the lumbar region.	0.8705362
As for the reduction of the types of this dislocation, it is that you look; if the dislocation is old, it has become chronic with its owner, and he has not tried to reduce it, and it has remained in its state, then there is no treatment at all, so you should not deal with it.	As to the reduction of the various forms of this dislocation, you must examine the case and if it be an old dislocation which the patient has suffered from for a long time and the reduction of which has not been contrived and which remains as it was, there is no treatment for it at all, nor should any be attempted.	0.8107077
As for he whose dislocation is recent, and whatever type it may be of the four ways of dislocation, hasten to twist the joint and extend it inward and outward and move it right and left, perhaps it will return and will not need any other treatment.	But in that case whose dislocation is recent, whichever of the four kinds of dislocation it be, hasten to rotate the joint and extend it internally and externally and move it to the right and the left; for often it will return and no further treatment will be needed.	0.8745711
If it does not return like this, then you should prepare a strong servant who will extend his leg from below, either with his hands or with a bandage tied around his leg above the knee, and another servant will extend him from above by putting his hands under his armpits, then he will tighten a soft bandage on the origin of the thigh, and a third servant will hold the end of the bandage, and his extension will be either from the front from the groin to the collarbone or from the back to the back.	But if it does not go back thus, you must have ready a sturdy and powerful assistant to extend the leg from below, either with both his hands or with a wrapper bound upon the leg above the knee; while another assistant pulls from above by putting his hands under the patient's axillae; then you should bind a soft wrapper upon the root of the thigh, with a third assistant to hold the end of the bandage. Then extension should be made either anteriorly from the direction of the groin to the direction of the clavicle, or posteriorly toward the dorsal spine.	0.8874202
And their extension will all be at once until the patient is raised from the ground with his body and remains suspended.	Let them all make their extension simultaneously so the patient is lifted up bodily and remains suspended.	0.7603454
For this type of extension is a common type for the four types.	This kind of extension is common to all four kinds of dislocation.	0.83848834
If the dislocation returns as we said, otherwise, each type must have the special treatment that I mention.	If the dislocation goes back by the way we have said, good. Otherwise, each kind must have the special treatment I shall describe.	0.90030855
As for its special reduction if the dislocation is inward, the patient should lie on his healthy side, then you place a bandage on the origin of the thigh between the head of the femur and the area under the groin, then you extend the bandage upward from the groin to the upper body to the collarbone, then another strong servant takes with his arms and embraces the thick area of the diseased thigh and extends it outward with a strong pull, then it returns to its place.	When it is an internal dislocation then the special reduction is for the patient to lie upon his sound side; then apply a wrapper to the root of the hip in the space between the head of the femur and the part below the groin; then carry the bandage upward from the groin toward the upper part of the body, in the direction of the clavicle. Then another powerful and sturdy assistant is to take hold of his arms while the thick part of the afflicted thigh is clasped and strongly extended outward; then it will return to its place.	0.89142275
And this type is easier than the other types of treatment by which this limb is reduced.	This kind of treatment is easier than the others for the reduction of this limb.	0.85665905
If it is difficult for you and it does not respond to entering with this type of treatment at all, then you should tie the patient's legs together with a strong, soft bandage on the heels and on the knees, and the distance between each one of them should be the length of four fingers, and the diseased leg should be extended more than the other by the length of two fingers.	But if you find it refractory and it does not answer to this method of treatment, then the patient's two feet will have to be bound together with a strong soft bandage round his two ankles and his two knees. The distance from each to the next should be four fingers, and the injured leg should be stretched two fingers beyond the other.	0.81613433
Then the patient is suspended from the head by a wooden beam that is in the house, and its distance from the ground is the length of two arms, then you order a strong boy to embrace the head of the femur, and another boy will hold onto the patient, and the other boy who is embracing the femur will push strongly, then the joint returns to its place quickly.	Then the patient is to reach upward and grasp any beam that may be in the house; he should be about two cubits from the floor. Then tell a powerful servant to clasp the head of the hip and another servant to hang from the patient; and the other servant, the one who is clasping the hip, should thrust powerfully; then the hip will speedily go back.	0.7668711
As for its special reduction if the dislocation is outward, the patient should lie on the bench according to what we described for the hunchback, and tighten the bandage on his diseased leg especially and on his chest, then two wooden beams are placed, one at his feet and the other at his head, then an additional wooden beam is placed in the middle of the bench, very securely fastened, with a wet cloth wrapped around it so as not to hurt the patient, so that the beam is between his thighs so that he does not be pulled downward during the extension.	The special method of reduction in the case of an external dislocation: it will be necessary for the patient to be lying on a bench after the manner described for the one with a curvature of the spine; but wrappers are to be tied only on the injured leg and the chest. Then the two spars are to be set in position, one at his feet and another at his head; and have an additional spar firmly fixed in the middle of the bench and wrapped in soft cloth so as not to injure the patient; this spar is to be between his thighs so that he will not be dragged down during extension.	0.84976375
Then each servant extends to his side and the physician straightens the hip with his hands.	Then each assistant is to pull in his own direction while the doctor sets the hip with his hands.	0.83364
If it responds to the return, otherwise, place the board on him and compress it as we mentioned in the hunchback, except that the patient should lie on his healthy side.	And if it goes back, good. But if not, place the board upon it and put pressure upon it just as we prescribed for curvature, except that the patient will have to lie upon his sound side.	0.8157365
And if the dislocation is forward, then you should extend the patient's leg at once, while he is in this very description on the bench, and the physician places the palm of his right hand on the diseased groin, then he presses it with the other hand, and with that, the pressure is extended downward to the knee.	When it is an anterior dislocation, extension will have to be applied forcefully to the patient's leg, on the bench, exactly as described; the doctor should place the palm of his right hand upon the injured groin and then apply pressure with the other hand, directing the pressure so as to make extension downward toward the knee.	0.8731017
And if the dislocation is backward, it should not be extended downward while it is raised from the ground, but it should be placed on something solid, as it should also be if his hip is dislocated outward, according to what we mentioned of his lying on the bench, and he is on his face, and the bandages are tightened as we said before, and the compression with the board should also be used on the place where the joint came out.	If it is a posterior dislocation the patient must not be raised above the ground and extended downward; rather must he be placed upon something hard, in the manner that we prescribed for an external displacement of the hip: he is to lie prone on the bench with the bands tied as we said before. It will also be necessary to apply pressure with the board to the site to which the joint has been displaced.	0.86566424
When the hip joint returns completely as it should, and the sign of its return will not be hidden from you, which is that you extend the patient's legs; if you see them level and the patient grasps and extends the leg without difficulty, then know that the limb has returned as it should. Then, bring the thighs together, apply the bandage, and tighten it with a turban so tightly that the hip does not move to any side, and the patient must remain still for three or four days, then untie the bandage, and compare the leg with the other.	When the proper reduction of the joint is completed—the signs of reduction will be plain to you; namely, that you extend both the patient's legs, and when you see that both legs are of equal length and the patient can draw up and stretch out the leg without difficulty, then you may know that the limb has gone back as it should—then bring both thighs together, apply the plaster and bind with a sash so that the hip does not move in any direction; and the patient is to keep perfectly quiet for three or four days. Then loosen the bandage and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other.	0.910774
If you see them equal in size, then know that the dislocation has healed, so allow the patient to walk.	If you see that they are both the same size you may know that the dislocation is cured and you can allow the patient to walk freely.	0.82902
And if you see some relaxation in it, then return and bandage it and tighten it according to your first tightening and leave it for three days as well, then untie it and let him walk slowly on it for days until it strengthens well, God willing.	But if you see any slackening then repeat: replaster and rebandage as you did at first, and leave for another three days. Then unfasten. He should be cautious about walking on it for some days, until it is thoroughly strong, God willing.	0.83493257
