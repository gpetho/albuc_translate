 CHAPTER THREE.
On the cauterization of non-chronic migraine.
 When there occurs pain with headache in one side of the head and the pain extends to the eye; and the patient has cleared his head with purging drugs and there has been applied the other treatment that I have mentioned in the sections on diseases, but to no avail; in this disorder cauterization is of two sorts, either with caustic or with the actual cautery.
This is the manner of cauterization with caustic: take one clove of garlic; peel it and cut both ends off; then cut open the site of the pain in the temple with a broad scalpel till there is room to contain the clove under the skin; then introduce it under the skin till it lies completely hidden.
Then bind up the wound tightly over it with pads and leave for fifteen hours; then unbind it, remove the garlic, and leave the wound open for two or three days; then apply cotton wool soaked in butter till it suppurates.
Then dress with ointment till it heals.
If you would rather, you may carry it out with one of the caustic drugs that I have included in the eighteenth treatise, on caustics.
 The actual cauterization with iron should be done in this way: heat a cautery of this shape.
It is called the claviform; the head is nailshaped in that there is a slight curvature with a small protuberance in the middle.
Apply it then to the site of the pain, hold your hand steady and revolve it little by little.
Let the thickness of skin burnt be about half; then remove your hand so as not to burn a subjacent artery, for thus a haemorrhage arises.
Then soak some cotton wool in saline, apply to the place, and leave three days; then apply cotton wool with butter; then treat with ointment till it heals.
Or if you prefer you can cauterize this migraine with the knife-edge that juts out from the cautery; but be careful not to cut an artery, specially in this kind of migraine that is non-chronic.
