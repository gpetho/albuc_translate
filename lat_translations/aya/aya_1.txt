Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have completed for you, Son, this book, which is the last of medical science with its complement, and having finished it from its explanations and declarations, I thought it fitting to complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of surgery, that is, surgery by hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since surgery by hand is laid out in our region and in our time entirely private: until perhaps the science of it has perished, and its track has been lost: and there remain no remains of it except a few descriptions in ancient books which hands have twisted: and it happened to them error and hesitation, until their intentions were closed and their meaning was drawn out: It seemed to me that I would make it clear with this arrangement of this treatise according to the second intention of explanation and declaration and abbreviation: and that I would bring it into being with the forms of tools Cautery, and the rest of the instruments of operation: since it is necessary to add a declaration and proper ownership.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	Since therefore the reason for which a good craftsman of this hand is not found in our time, it is: because the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary that its author be exercised before it in the science of anatomy, which Galen narrated, until he knows the joints of members, and their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, and nerves, and ligaments, and counting them, and their exits, and their pulse beats, and quiet, and places of departure.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And for this reason Hippocrates said, A name with a name is much, and with work it is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	But we have already said about that at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since who is not aware that we have said about anatomy, will not be satisfied unless he falls into error, in which men are formed from this science, and boast of it without knowledge or experiment.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What is, because I saw a doctor seize an apoplexy scrofulous in the neck of a woman, and hit some arteries in the neck: why flowed the blood of the woman until she fell dead between her hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another doctor who presumed to extract a stone from the urine, which had stayed for a long time, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So he came to him, and extracted it with a twig of grass.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Why the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I had already been called to extract it; and I saw from the great size of the stone and the care of the nurse that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor who was taking a fee from the Duke of our land for medicine; and it happened that a black eunuch, who was with him, broke his thigh near the heel; and the doctor did not notice this ignorance and bound the break tightly to the shin with strong staples and did not let go of the wound's discharge.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he set it right according to his desire.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Later on he discharged him after a few days and ordered him not to loosen the bonds; and he remained so until his leg was withered away, and his weight, and came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	So I was called to him; and I tried to loosen the bonds; and there followed peace, and he was free from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the corruption had already been confirmed in the member; and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	So then the corruption ceased to walk in the member, until it died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another doctor who pierced an apoplexy cancerous; and it was ulcers after days, until the disease of him became evident to his lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	That is, because when the cancer is pure from the melancholy humor, then it should not be used at all to draw it out with iron unless it is in a member that bears it, so that it may be cut off all of it.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for that reason, my sons, it is necessary that you know that surgery is divided into two parts: namely, the operation to which health is associated, and the operation with which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already aroused, in all places of this book, where an operation has come, where there is fear and alarm.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Why is it necessary for you to be afraid of that, and to avoid it completely: so that they may not hear the loudest word, or become ashamed to speak.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore take a measure with carefulness and protection, and bring the sick among you with ease and firmness, so that by the grace of God for salvation and glorious succession: and remove terrible illnesses from difficult healing: and remove your souls from there, which makes you afraid, so that it may come upon you hesitation in our faith and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For there is more remaining to our glory, and higher in the world this way: and finally to our numbers.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen has already said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat illness with medicine: do not call yourself a doctor for the worst.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	I have already divided this treatise into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	First chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	On the Precaution with Fire, and the Precaution with Acute Medicine, Raw Herbs, and the Arrangement of Tools, and Tools for Cauterization: and everything necessary for an operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Second chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On cutting and puncturing, phlebotomy and venesection, and wounds: and extracting arrows, and similar things: and all the chapter, arranged by the forms of tools.
Capitulum tertium.	Third chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration, and dislocation, and cure for torsion, and similar things: the chapter arranged from the head to the feet, and the forms of tools.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.

Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Regarding the use of cautery and the types of wounds that require it, the timing of its application, and whether it should be used with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I explain the nature of the operation and its effects, I must discuss the qualities of cautery and non-cauterization and when they should be used on different types of wounds.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I therefore say that the speech about the quality of cauterization and non-cauterization is a long, subtle, learned, and secret speech.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	A multitude of wise men also spoke on this matter and disagreed among themselves; however, I will suffice with a few of their words, as I am afraid of repetition.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say that cautery is applicable to all types of wounds, whether they are deep or superficial, and with or without matter. Except for two types of wounds, which are deep and dry and devoid of matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	But in the case of warm and dry wounds with matter, they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some said that cautery is applied to healing wounds.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	But others said the opposite, that cautery is not suitable for a disease characterized by heat and dryness, as fire's nature is warmth, and it is contrary to how one heals from a hot and dry illness with warmth and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who spoke against this said: "The application of cautery is appropriate for any hot and dry illness that occurs in human bodies, because when you compare a human body to the elements and its moisture to the element of fire, the body becomes cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I myself say through my own experience: because I have sometimes discovered it for myself.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not necessary to insist on this point unless one has already proven and practiced in the last exercise of the chapter on cauterization, and knows the diversity of human complexions, the nature of illnesses within them, their causes, and the accidents that occur with them, as well as the timing of these illnesses.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	But fear not the residue of poultices upon you: and above all in cold and moist diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all doctors have come to agree about them: and they do not differ in their opinion from Cauthereius on these matters.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know you sons, that the secret of the cure through cauterization with fire, and its goodness in comparison with medication burned with it, is this: for fire is simple, whose action does not reach, except to the member which is cauterized: and does not hurt another member connected with it, except by a little harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	But the action of medicine burned does reach to that which is prolonged from the members: and perhaps makes difficult the cure of a hard disease, and perhaps destroys it.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire because of its softness and goodness of its substance, does not do this, unless it is in excess.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	But that has already become clear to us through experimentation, because of the length of practice and study with skill, and stability on the truth of things: and through it I forgive the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not, for it is not allowed to my book, I would deliver to you the secret and mystery of fire, and the quality of its action in the bodies through its expulsion, which expels diseases through philosophical demonstration by the minds of your own, which are acquired with difficulty.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know you sons, that they disagree at times when cauterization is to be done, and set a better time for the wound.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cauterization is appropriate at all times: for the harm that happens because of time is hidden in the cure, which is attracted with cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And above all if cauterization is because of the pains from painful diseases, strong, and feasts which do not tolerate delay: for they fear those things, that evil which is greater than a little harm, which cannot be tolerated through time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not say to you sons, that they do not estimate it, unless the common and stupid doctors: that is, they consider that the disease which is cured with cauterization does not always return: and they set a consequence, and it is not as they think: for cauterization is not, except in place of medicine, which changes complexion, and dries out the humidities which are causes, from which the pains arise.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem valetudinis suae, et virtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et virtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	Indeed, the cauterization supera
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in a few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But the word of the popular, which is that the cauterization is the last resort of medicine, is a wrong statement: for they believe that it is not a cure that is brought about by medicine, nor by any other means after the occasion for cauterization has passed.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But on the contrary, it is precisely because we use means of cure in some diseases and not others that we then apply cauterization at the end: so then it follows that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention that the common people and many doctors understand it.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	But the ancient ones said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron: and they did not say that, except for the reason of the equality of the value of gold, and the substance of itself: and they said that it does not leave a place for cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But that is not absolutely true: for I have myself tested that, and found that it does not do so in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And the cauterization with itself is good, and better than with iron, as they say.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	But verily when you ignite the gold cautery in fire, it is not known to you when it is ignited according to the quantity that you wish, because of the redness of gold: and when it is proper for it to be cold, and if you add it to the top of the ignition, it melts in the fire, and turns into leaves. Why does the craftsman fall from that in occupation: and therefore we make the cautery with iron with us more quickly and closer, from the right to the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I have already arranged this Chapter in the Cautery, according to chapters: and I have arranged them from the head down to the feet: that you may easily find what you seek out of it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	De mode cauterizandi caput in commissura coronali.
Caput II.	 رأس  رأس
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Here is the confirmation of cauterization for the lord of humidity and холодности on the head: which are two causes of salt, and a multitude of flux of humors from the head to the parts of eyes and ears, and a multitude of sleep, and pain of teeth, and pain of throat: and generally all sickness, which happens from coldness, such as paralysis, and salt, and convulsions, and strokes, and similar things from sickness.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is, that you prescript to the sick: that he may be drained out in the first place with a solution medicine, which purifies the head, three nights, or four, according to what requires the virtue of the nurse, and his age, and custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then prescript to him, that he make his head radiant with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands square, so that he has placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	So then whatever your middle finger touches, mark that place with fire.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then the fire cautery: which has this form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place the wound on the marked spot with the caustice, descent, so that your hands are slowly constricted, and you rotate it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly put your hand on it, and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	That if you see already detected from the bone amount of salt, or amount of garlic, then quickly put your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the iron, or with another from him if it is cold: until you see the bones that I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and dip it into the cotton ball, and place it on the spot: and let go for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place over the wound cotton dipped in butter, and let it go on the spot, until the fire scar is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for that with the four-ingredient ointment, until healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	I have already said, that while the wound remains open, it will emit pus: why is better and more beneficial to be cleaned.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said, that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone: and hold the cautery, until a certain hardness of bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then it is sharpened after that which has been burned from the bone, then oiled.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that the cautery should be applied to the last place, until it impresses on the bone an impression of a forking, so that the bone is made as the form of a fork: or with an instrument that women put in a little vessel of ink: and they estimate, that from this place emit vapours of the head's smell, and the open wound should be left for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then oil, until it is hardened.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But I do not know these two kinds of cautery at all if they are not used by some people out of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	Then let go of it, for me it is better with the health of it.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the solution of its natural continuity: as we have testified in the other members: and above all when the head is weak and feeble in nature: and the species of the cautery is first of all more preserved and better with me, and I use it: so operate when it is healthy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.
Caput III.	Of the way of cauterizing the head, when it is in pain throughout all the head.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When in the whole head there happens to be a chronic pain: and it is prolonged in a person who is ill, and uses honey, and broths, and head-purges, and oils, and employment with the hand.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has been cauterized once by one that we have described, and gives no benefit from those: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head is strong of its natural creation, and is not weak, and finds a cold sensation severe: then cauterize with another cautery below it a little.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize itself on all the horns of its head with its own cautery, and let not the skin be drawn off, and let a quantity be revealed from the bone, which we have described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize itself with one cautery in the backend of its head, in the place which is called a vas; and it is a place in which is placed a flowing [one]: and wash your hair well in this, and do not reveal the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the weak one finds, on account of that severe pain, and is separated from the pain of the other parts of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will call this Cautery in its place: and it must be that it is a cautery, whereby the horns of the head are cauterized, and the backend of the head, subtler by a cautery, whereby the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	Of the way of cauterizing in a headache, so much as to the medicine added, as to the iron.
Caput IIII.	Head IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When a pain and swelling occurs in the part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is washed with medications that clear it, and the remaining treatment is given, as I have said in the division of illnesses, and this does not include everything, then cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with an acute medicine burning; or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	But cauterization with an acute medicine burning is, if you take a tooth of another person, and chop it up, and cut off the ends from the two sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut the place of pain at the time with a phlebotome on the side, until it becomes in it a place under the skin, where the knot is captured.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then introduce it into him under the skin, until it is hidden: then tie it over it with a little knot of constricting thread, and let go of it for fifteen hours, and then dissolve it, and take out one more, and let go for two days, or three: then put on it a cotton pad immersed in butter, until a pus place forms: then care for the wound with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you want to do this with certain medicines that burn, which I wrote in the twelfth book, On Burning Medications.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	But cauterization with iron is according to this method:
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The fire cauterization, whose form is this one:
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a 'clauis'; because the form of the head is like the form of a 'clauis', in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small eminence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then put the iron on the place, and hold your hand: and you turn the iron slowly with speed; and let be the amount that burns due to the thickness of the skin, like half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And you turn your hand so that it does not burn any artery that is below, and happens to run blood.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then dip the cotton pad in saline water, and put it on the place, and let go for three days: then dip the cotton pad in butter: then care for with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you see, cauterize this half-headache with extreme knife-slashing cauterization second Cauterio.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And do not heal the arterial incision in this half-headache, but properly old.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	§ The mode of cauterizing in ancient half-headache.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat a headache, with this that we have said from the previous cure, and that we have said in the divisions of ailments, and there is no cure: and you see from sickness that it is not sufficient for him what we have said from the first cauterization with medicine, or with cauterization with fire, then it is necessary to use the fire of cauterization by a knife, until it becomes white after the marks on the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or almost like that: and set your hand down with force, and squeeze it until you touch the artery, and reach all the way to the jaw.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you, so that you cauterize the continuation of the jaw, which moves during chewing, so as not to be damaged on the side, or the nerve that moves it, from which a spasm occurs.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be over guard, and care about the flow of blood of the artery, which has been cut off.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For there is a fear in the disconnection, and especially to him who does not know that which he does, and is not studious, nor expert: and dismisses the operation with the first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come with a reminder of the regimen of the flow of blood from the artery according to its way, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	That if you see from sickness that this cauterization is not sufficient for him, and you see the body tolerating cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have told, heal the wound, until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you see, administer the cauterization, which we have said in the chapter on extracting the artery with a cauterizer having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cauterization is better and more helpful in this regard.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	The way to cauterize ear pain.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and is cured with hot things, and the remaining cure as we have said in the division, and the pain does not disappear, then cauterization with fire: and this is what is called a point, whose form is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then the points with it after its igniting around the whole ear, as it resolves: or around each side, if the pain is simultaneous in both sides.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And lengthen it with the cautery a little from the root of the ear, after you have marked the places with the causticum: and the quantity of the cautery is ten points in all the ear, and almost the same.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then cure the place, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	The way to cauterize in torture.

Torrence which is cured with cauterization, is not excepting species which occur from the mucus, according to what we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And distant cauterization of the species which occurs from drying, and spasm of a nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you cure this species of torture with hyssop, and the headpurges, and gargarisms, and your cure does not help, then you should cauterize the sick three times: one near the root of the ear, and a second a little lower than its place, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And put your cautery on the opposite side of the weak part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Since softening does not occur, unless in the part which appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of the cautery is, so that it cauterizes itself with the cautery in the direct extremity of the upper ear at the top of the head a little bit: and another in the time: whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cautery, until half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of cautery, and it is a kind from the knife, whose form is mentioned above: verily, however, it is not much more subtle than that, as you see; and it is necessary that the knife be slightly less bulky.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with it where it preceded: until it heals.

Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This, however, is the method of cauterizing: and make it according to the same order which we have said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	But if he heals by that, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.

Then wash the head with milk; then cauterize himself with the cautery in the middle of the head, and with the cautery on all the horns of the head, and with the cautery on the posterior part, and with three cauteries on the three bends of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	But if you are not able to endure the purification of the body in many cases, and if you are weak at endurance, and the disease is strong: then cauterize himself with four cauteries on the bends of the back, and the last one with a cautery, until it burns through his skin a lot, and wash your hand.

Therefore it is necessary that you should purify his brain first with fire, and with the other cure which we have mentioned in the division: when the disease is strong, or endurance is weak in the reception of medicines.

But if he is a boy who does not endure medicines, then administer gargarisms and chewing which purify the brain before those days with many good foods.

Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery is in two ways: either with fire: or with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In the cautery, if it is with fire, command the patient before it, so that he loses his hair, if he is of those who clean them, until they are lengthened and made even.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If it pricks him by his root: then squeeze the eyes of the patient with witty, so that they do not move, until they are closed.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they are then closed and made even, put the head of the patient in your lap: and then sign it on the eyelids of his eyes with encausticum, a sign that it is according to the figure of the leaf of myrrh: and let the beginning of the sign be near the hair.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then put a cotton wisp dipped in albumen or in silken yarn on the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then fire to the cautery, whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then he cauterizes on top of the figure, which you have marked little by little on many pieces, until the surface of the skin is burned, which is like a figure of a bay tree leaf, all apparent in itself.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the mark of your work is health: if you squeeze the eyelids of the eye and make the hair grow near the eye when you cut it.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	So bless your hand then: and dismiss them from the tribes after a few days.

When it happens in the liver that there is pain from cold and moisture, or from a thick wind, until it emerges from its skin by natural exit of excess fluid, and the sick person is cared for with what we have said, and does not benefit in him: then it is necessary that the sick person lie down on his back on his skin, and sign with the caustice three cauteries according to this shape, and the same quantity above the lowerスパ, from where the man's bed reaches: and let there be a space which is what is between every cautery according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be according to the length of the body straight: and do not squeeze your hand much with the caustice.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity which is to be burned from the thickness of the skin, half of its quantity without addition: and let the sick person stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	If he is not standing, then let him lie down, who has already extended his legs and raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the caustice.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is also possible for you, when you have a small knife with you, that you cauterize this caustice with a knife, when you are with subtlety and wisdom in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And guard yourself, so that you do not proceed in the cauterization, and burn the thickness of the skin all at once, since it burns the whole body, and arrives at the intestines: for the skin is there subtle, so you know that one.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	To cauterize the aploms of the liver.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30: On cauterizing the aploms of the liver.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	If an exit is present and you want to know whether it is an aploma of the liver or of its membrane (peritoneum), then if it is in the liver, you will notice that the pain is weak and there is no sharp pain; and if it is on the membrane of the liver, the pain is very sharp: and you will see that the doctors' treatment has weakened them.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Then the patient should lie on his back.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then, with a caustic, draw out the shape of the aploma  (if it is in the liver): and then light the caustic with fire so that it is absorbed by radiation.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize it with one caustic, until the skin is all burned up and reaches the nipple   (liver), then take care of the patient's cure for exitulatory wounds, until he is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary that this caustic be used only by those who have extended their studies in the art of medicine: and since, through this procedure, some illnesses have sometimes been cured with experience  , then one should dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	However, if you want to let go of it, in my opinion it is better not to do so.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the method of cauterizing in the pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31: On cauterizing in the pleurisy.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that with root of aristolochia caustics applied to the pleurisy  (cold pleurisy) in this way:
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is as follows: when you receive the dry root of aristolochia   (long root that can be found in it), and make it as large as a finger   (long, thick root):
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil: and set it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize it with one caustic in it that is between the rib and the neck    (furcula), and two small ones slightly below the angle towards the side that is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And two cauterizings also in him, which is between the fifth and sixth ribs falling back a little: and a cauterizing another in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauterizings from behind: one in him that is between two blades; and two cauterizings from the two sides of the chest, lower cauterizing which is between two blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary that you should compress your hand with the cautery, but let it be in the open skin smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancient men said that from men who use a cautery of similar iron radius: and set it on fire, and put it in him that is between ribs until it comes to the same as the apostema, and the pus comes out: as we have said in the apostema of the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this piercing with the cautery there is fear, that either the weak one dies at once, or a fistula happens to the place, which is not healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	§ On the way of cauterizing the Spleen Head XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you are curing the disease of the spleen, with him that we have said in the division of diseases, and your cure does not give, then cautery is in it according to three ways, which are all right.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	Of which one is that you make three cauterizings, or four lining according to the length of the spleen according to the figure of the Epatis cauteries, whose precursor was the figure.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be a quantity of roughness between every cautery as much as a finger's breadth, or more little.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let there be a way of the cautery, which we have said in the cauterizing of the liver equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not compress your hand with the cautery: and let the sick one be lying on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And the way of another cauterizing is: that it has two hot wires, which we have said in the chapter on shoulder dislocation: and let go of the skin, which is in the direct spleen, where the cubitus goes to the left nurse: and let your lift up go up according to the width of the body, so that the cauterizings fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then introduce two hot irons strongly, until you pierce with them the skin from one side: then remove the iron; so there are four cauterizations.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with another iron having three irons, too.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then take care that the cauterization is done after having sent away the pus for many days: for each part which has been treated before, takes more time to heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	De mode cauterizing in Hydropsis.
Caput XXXIII.	Head 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not fall in Hydropsis unless it is properly elevated.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat a Hydropic patient with the modes of treatment which we have spoken of in connection with division, and when there is no healing, then you should cauterize the umbilicus four times, one cautery above the stomach, one above the liver, one above the spleen, two behind the spine between the vertebrae, one on the right side at the base of the heart, and one on the left side at the base of the stomach: and the depth of the cautery should be proportionate to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then remove the open cautery so that it can discharge pus after a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not leave the sick person unhealed after cauterization, because there are two purposes to be served: and he will quickly recover with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the cautery when the abdomen is cauterized, should be a tube: second, because it precedes in form; and its shape when the back is cauterized, should be an oval, because it precedes in form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	De mode cauterizing of the Feet and Legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Head 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they are bed-ridden and filled with yellow water, you should cauterize the back of the foot in the space between the auricular and the lateral bone, which is under the thumb: and stretch your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then stretch your hand again, and do not turn the cautery at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For this reason water should be yellow, and the cautery should be of this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then, two cauterys should be made on the two legs, and a knife-like cautery should be made at the end of each cautery: and one cautery should be made along the length of the leg, one under the knee, and the other below it, about halfway down the leg: and two cauterys should be made on all the hip: and do not leave the open cautery without care for a long time, so that it heals over from it some water: then take care of himself with the rest that we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	The way to cauterize in the solution of the belly.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When this solution of the belly has weakened the protective powers and digestive power which are in the stomach and intestines: and cure it with the methods of curing, and it does not heal: and you will see that it tolerates the cauterization of great power, then cauterize it itself with a large cautery over its own stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery and four subtile cauteries around the navel, and a cautery above the liver with an edge: and a cautery above the loins with one or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see moisture emerging and the body tolerating it, then cauterize it itself with a cautery over the chest, and a cautery over all the pelvis: and perhaps you should add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For this cure is successful, whose power does not fail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	The way to cauterize Hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are of thick humors, cold, or corrupt humors, and the cure with that which we have said in the division, and it does not produce a result: then cauterize three cauteries on the lower part of the back under an egg-shaped triangle, and a cautery below the navel almost like two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is cold and his food is not digested, and you see a pale face, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and cauterize over his spleen, and another over his liver, with a cautery clamped; and let go the cautery opened at some time: then take care of him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	How to cauterize the patient after the removal of his organs.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you are cutting off the patient's organ, then you set fire to the cautery so that it burns by radiation.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the patient' s organ that has been cut off, and with your last hand, before the cautery reaches the opening of the stomach from which blood flows, once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If then there are many organs, then cauterize each one separately, as we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them while he puts the ointment on them, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cautery over his throat, it is more final in its effect.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	The mode of cauterizing the fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not submit to the incision and operation that we have described in his place, and shudders at it, perhaps he will be healed with the cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When then happens to someone that there is a fistula, and it has become old, pus flows out of it, and corrupted moisture.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is therefore fitting that you should test it with a subtle attempt.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then know the depth of its extent with your attempt.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then set fire to the cautery, which is like radiation.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then introduce yourself with the burning end in the fistula and measure the quantity in which it enters by the clamp.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cautery on it, until all the corrupted bodies are burnt out, once, or twice, or three times, according to the need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And I will keep you safe from the heat of the sun, if there is one, or from the great blood vessels: or if a fistula has opened into the body of the bladder, or into the body of the intestine, then I will keep you safe from these places everywhere.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not make this unless a fistula is in a fleshy place: and think, for it does not pierce.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the place until it has healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place is sealed, and the materials have been cut away from it, and it remains like this for a long time: then you shall know that it has now healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if it is not cut away from it by the materials, then you shall know that it is penetrating, or its opening is deep within it, or almost like it from among those: of which there is a memory in its own place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	The way to cauterize Renes.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When it happens in the kidneys that pain comes from cold, or from gross wind, and it lingers because of that, then you should cauterize the same above the skin on top of the kidneys, cautery on each kidney with cautery of the claw, whose reminder came first.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterized that within itself second time in itself almeidatum.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Why are there three lines?
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	So they will be more last in the bonding.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	The way to cauterize the Vesica.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When it happens in the Vesica that weakness, and softening from cold rain and moisture, until it does not retain the weak urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the supply on top of the Vesica, where the hairs begin to interweave, and cautery from the right supply, and another from its left: and let the length of that cauterization be according to the measure of the thumb knuckle: and cauterize it with cautery on the lower back, or two cauteries if you can bear it: and let it follow the reminder of the previous cauterization with the claw.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	If the wound is deep, cauterize the matrix.
Caput XLI.	De modo cauterizandi matricem.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture occur in the womb, and it is forbidden by this means from impregnation, and her menstrual fluids are corrupted, and their procreation is delayed, and she experiences pain at the arrival of her visitors, then it should be cauterized with three cauterizations around the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the vagina, and a cauterization below the back on the skin, or two cauterizations: and let the cautery sit.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	De modo cauterizandi matricem.
Caput XLII.	When the hymen is torn in the dislocation
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the mucous membranes exude moisture towards the vagina, and it becomes a cause of exit from its place: and its sign is that the skin prolongs on one side when they face each other: and the site of the dislocation is found in it vacant.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it should be that the sick one is cauterized over the vagina with a similar circle of the caustic: after which you mark with the caustic around the opening, as it turns: and that it falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the caustic sit whose form preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	That if this caustic is not present with you, then you should cauterize it with three caustics, with a large oily caustic: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the quantity of its thickness of the skin of all.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the one, until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	The mode of cauterizing in sciatica:
Caput XLIII.	When the sciatic nerve is injured, and there is pain, or numbness, or tingling, or loss of sensation, or weakness, or paralysis, or when the patient experiences these symptoms after an injury, then cauterize the sciatic nerve with a sharp tool, such as a knife or needle.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the vagina, and it is a cause of its coldness and moisture: and the sick one is cured with it, as we have said in the division, and the cure does not benefit him, and it becomes old: then it should be that you remove the sickness from gross humors with foetid pills, or with artificial pills, and similar.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then he cauterizes it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cauterization in it is according to two ways: either with medicines that are applied, or with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Either with fire, which is according to many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	Of which one is, that he cauterizes over a piece of salt of his own body with three triangular cautery tools, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them a good depth, or a bad one.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And there is a space that is between each cautery of the quantity of the finger's thickness: and let the cautery be oil.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	When it is made a cautery in the middle on top of the head of his own body.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Why are there four cautery tools?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose preceding form was in the cauterization of dislocation of his own body, one: so that the circle contains all the body.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the skin of all.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cauterization in the sciatic nerve when the pain adheres to his own body, and does not extend until the hip and the leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends until the hip and the leg, then he cauterizes himself with two cautery tools on top of the hip, in the place where the pain injures, in which there is a pain, and his own cautery tool on top of the nail of the little finger slightly: and let the cautery be scissor-like.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And make the depth of the cauterization according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	That if the injured person complains that the pain extends almost to the toes, then he cauterizes himself there with a point cautery tool, three, four, or more, if he likes it.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if the injured person complains that there is pain under the knee towards the leg, then he cauterizes himself there with a scissor-like cautery tool.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And cause yourself in all your cauterization, so that you do not end with a cautery tool that burns the nerves, or a large artery, and does not hurt the patient with it on top of a bad injury, or a contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And verily I have seen one and the other, of those who cauterized above the knuckle, and ultimately stayed in cauterization, and the leg was inflated until the tumor attached to the foot, and it was perforate all over, and all weight was corrupt: then a solution of the eye happened, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	That if there is pain in two parts at the same time, cauterize each one according to this way.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise ones have said in cauterization of the anchus, whose cauterization is this mode.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar replica out of iron, whose diameter is half the size of the palm: and let it be at the opening of its nail according to the thickness of the finger nail, or less than that: and within that third replica sit a third replica.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let there be space that is between each replica according to the quantity of the knuckle nail: and let the replicas open on two sides: and let their height be almost like a knot, or two knots: and make them handles out of iron crookedly adapted in the replicas.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be heated in fire, until it rusts, and let sparks come out: then let it be placed on a paste of the anchus laid down on the sound side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Then cauterize him with three round cauterizations in one stream.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let him go after three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Then smear it with butter: and let the nail open be left for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the man with ointment, until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Says Albucasis, with this kind of cauterization of the son, we are little used, because of the look of fear: and therefore, because we find few who wait over the man.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, there is from good cauterizations to him who suffers, and he finds with him the place of his wound.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	But the cauterium is with the medicines that burn, so that you make two replicas having a hole in the wrist, in which descends a pin of his door out of iron, or steel, length of walls: whose height are two knots, or almost like them.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And there should be a space that is between the two quantities of the thickness of the finger, and they are opened from below and above: and there should be what contains itself adjacently, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then put it on top of the pillow on which the sick person lies on the sound side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And compress your hand hard against the pillow on which the sick person is lying on the sound side.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then tie between the two circles of warm water, which is heated with fire slightly, and hold it for a time: and let the sick person feel the tingling, and his own warmth, because he finds the tingling like fire, until he is calm.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then clean your hand with the instrument and wash off all the hot water with sweet water: then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put on top of it the butter, until the blackness of the burn comes off: and leave it for a few days, and let the pus run out of it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For this is the last of healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for that with ointment, until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or the leg: make him a rest in it that contains water, according to what you have done in the width equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the mode of hot water: and I have already written it in the book on rectifying medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkaline and burning not extinct on one side, wash both, and put them in a new bowl whose bottom part is pierced with a small hole, according to the amount that enters it: and put under the bowl another one that drips: and pour over the alkaline and the ash with sweet water, which immerses each one by the finger: then you compress them with your hand good compression: and set aside the bowl, until the sharp water in the bottom part of the dripping bowl has gone.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then gather all the water together and pour it over another ash: and wait, until it renews itself.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For then it will be sharp-wittedness which is mighty, which is administered in many operations of medicine, and in the cauterization of the remaining members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Since it will effect the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from medicines are, with which they cauterize the anus, also as a poultice, and oak galls, and lead with soap, so that both are mixed.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen himself relating, said about a man of an ancient cure, which he was cured of the pain of the anus and sciatica: and he magnified that it is mighty.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said, I do not prefer another cure, and because he was cured with one juice until he told, that perhaps he entered a hot bath, and came out of it already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is, to be taken from the oil of sesame: and if sesamum is not found, it is taken as it is, fresh: and it is boiled a lot with some fat, and placed on the anus, where there is pain, or in the crotch, or in the thigh: and it is tied on, and left for a quantity of three hours, or per quantity that the sick person feels the pain of sitting down because of heat.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then put him into a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	And when his body becomes wet with sweat, put him on the ground.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain has subsided, and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And you should know that it is not necessary to use any kind of application with these medicines unless after the body has been evacuated.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides who said, that when the sheep dung is applied to the sciatic nerve with fire, it brings him relief: and it becomes a wound in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take wool, and soak it with old oil, and place it on a deep place, which is between the thumb of the foot, and between the fire, and it is closer to the fire.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take sheep dung as it is, and light it on fire, until it becomes a coal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then put the flesh on the wool, and let it go, until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then do this again.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not cease to do this, until the sense has settled on the middle as far as the navel, and the pain has rested.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this mode of cauterization is called vaccinum cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	[¶] On cauterization for back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 48.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When pain occurs on the back from various causes, or from injury, or from excessive evacuation, and similar cases, only use the cold-water infusion: and cauterization should not be done, unless alone in this species, which is done by using cold water.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after the evacuation of the wound with foul pills and similar things, let three lines be drawn on the back where the pain is, according to the width of the palm, having five marks with caustice in each line, or more according to the quantity that comes from the tolerance of the nurse's power: and let cauterization be done with the caustic puncture.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you want, cauterize three or four times with the middle claw-shaped caustic, in this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	[¶] On the method of cauterizing in gangrene of the gibbus.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 50.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This illness often occurs in young infants.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of this disease in children is: which happens to him a stricture in the air passage during raising and movement: and swelling in the last spine of the back and its knots, which has already begun to emerge above the remaining spines.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, when you see this, and want to do it, then cauterize it with the caustic that is a circle according to this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And take the cautery over the whole spine evenly: and if you want to cauterize around the spine with the claw-shaped caustic twice or three times: and let the marks be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for the place, until it heals with it as we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And do not, let alone administer cauterization to the deformity, which is made in a spasm of a nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	§ The mode of cauterizing in podagra, and pain in joint-swellings.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVIII.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains of joint-swellings arise from cold fluids that flow into any limb of the body, then, according to the custom of physicians, they name this disease Podagra by itself.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	So when Podagra of a cold cause is to be cured with certain methods, and if the pains do not disappear, then let them be cauterized to remove those pains.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is, that the cauterization of it is after evacuation in the circumcision of the feet, with many cauterizations: and let the cauterization be made with olive oil.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is this form:
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you will bear to touch a spot on the face of the foot, then do so with the cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	That if the pains rise up to the knees, or other joint-swellings, and this often happens, then cauterize that spot over every knee with three cauterizations, or four from all sides, with this same cautery of Caelium.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	But if you need many of these cauterizations, then cauterize that spot.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, but rather let the fire be concentrated only on the skin's thickness.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	But if the pains rise up to the knees and back: then administer that which we have said about the cautery in our chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	That if the pains are in the hands only, then touch spots around a fire, as two lines spread out.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	But if any of the pains remain in the fingers, then touch those spots, over every knuckle a spot, and over the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	But if the pains arise after days in the shoulders, or arms, then cauterize both sides completely.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And not does the sick person recover from good management, from receiving medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if the regime is made good, and the phlegm is evacuated, the sick person will be healed with the help of God by this cauldron.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	Mode of cauterizing in ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 57.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine goes down, or the ball [of the testicle] comes near to the testicle: then you should instruct the sick person to abstain from food on his own day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use laxatives, so that the feces come out of his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and instruct him to hold his breath until he goes out, or shows his balls, or the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then let you reduce the person with your fingers, and mark him with the cauldron under the rupture over the spine of the pelvis, with a mark whose extreme is similar to the half of a circle to the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then set fire to the cauldron, which has this shape, until it becomes white, and let it throw up sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then let you reduce the intestine, or the ball to its concavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the servant put his hand on the place so that he does not come out of the intestine: and you have already opened between the legs of the patient, and placed under him a pillow, and one serving on his back, and another holding his chest, who holds the hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then let you place the cauldron on the person with the mark, with the hand holding the cauldron standing upright.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold him, until you have reduced the jaw: or repeat with another blow, if you are not successful with the first one up to the mouth.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe from the exit of the intestine during the time of your cauterization, that you do not burn him, and let it pass through him to the sick person or death, or great evil.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you are not successful with the cauldron in closing the mouth, your operation does not bring forth fruit.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	It is appropriate that the caustic be delicate for infants, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then the care with the other ointments, until it heals.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is closed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you give him food according to the length of his recovery time, which softens his stomach: so that he does not evacuate the intestines by straining and diarrhea.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then administer a loosely made ligature, and let him hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And he should not work, and should not be satisfied with food and drink, and should not have hot drinks.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, he recovers with whole healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will speak about the cure of wounds with incisions in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When, however, ruptures occur in the rest of the stomach, and they are incipient and do not add to each other, then cauterize his rupture with a round caustic according to its quantity: and let it be so burned from then on as the third part of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for him, following what I have said: and do not add to it.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some first say: let the rupture be cauterized with a triangular caustic, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	Afterwards, it is marked with encaustum, and a line that is across the width in the back upper rupture, and another line to the bottom.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the caustic closed.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first caustic is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	The mode of cauterizing in pains because of injury, or percussion.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When it happens in some member by injury or percussion: and that pain persisting for a long time, and not responding to treatment with medicines: then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a pointed caustic.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let there be a cautery for every limb according to its size, and its perfection, and its weakness, and its virtue, and its location of torsion, and the pain it causes.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore is healed by the first cauterization, it is well.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat over the same cauterization.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Since of these diseases is used to rotate, so that they change from one member to that which approaches it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Why should those things be carried out with a cauterization, until the sick is healed?
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	On the way of cauterizing in leprous disease.
Caput XLIX.	Head 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	But lepra when and as long as they are healed by a strong cauterization.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the kind of lepra which is made through putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: so that when you are cauterizing, consider the leg.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If however lepra is not able to be healed and you have treated it with the same cauterization, as we have said in the division, and it has not fallen off, and stands still: and you wait over the sick one, that corruption embraces his whole complexion: then cauterize him on the head with five cauterizations: one in the middle of the hairline, and a second lower down towards the front at the end of the hair, and two above the two horns, and one behind the ear next to the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And last, with a little finger slightly touched by the fire, until it prints in the mouth a deep impression, and the membranes are dislocated from it: so that the expiration of large vapors from it is eased, and cauterize also with the same fire on the spleen, according to what has preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if lepra is already spread over the sick one, and appears clearly: then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauterizations which we have said in the head, and a cauterization on the tip of the nose, and two cauterizations on each cheek, and two on the tips of the neck, and six on the back, and one large on the achilles tendons near the heels, and one behind it: and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the knees, and two on the breasts of his chest, and one above it: and two on each hand, and two on each foot, and one on the tips of their toes.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And let not the nerves which are above the heel bone burn thee.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And when the wound is cauterized with a cauldron over the shin bone, and with another over the stomach, and with another over the spine.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add cauterium, the more it is an aid, and gives strength.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that a sick person does not find pain in the cauterium, as he finds it when he is well: for his body is already stuporified.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And let the cauldron be of proper size and proportion according to the member and joints: according to which it preceedeth in appearance from the tools of the arsenal.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the cauldron with flour of herbs with honey, and with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.

Caput L.	[1]  Caput: nonne quod caput superum est, et super pedem, et super os sacrum? aut nonne super os cubiti? aut super os ulnarum? aut super os trapezii? aut super os clavorum? aut super os radiatum?
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	[1] When a member is stuporified and is treated with medicines, oils, plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize the stuporified member with the cauldron, according to which the magnitude of the member is increased, or its smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cauldron rest in the thickness of the skin a little.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with ointment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And when the cauldron is used for a certain stupor that happens to the hand, and to the foot, in the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerves that move that member: and the stupor vanishes.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But it does not preceed for that one, unless he is wise in anatomy of members, and the exit of the nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	§ On the mode of cauterizing in the Albaras.
Caput LI.	[1]  Caput: nonne quod caput superum est, et super pedem, et super os sacrum? aut nonne super os cubiti? aut super os ulnarum? aut super os trapezii? aut super os clavorum? aut super os radiatum?
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When ancient Albucasis is dismembered and there is nothing in him of the arts of medicine, then cauterize him with a deep cautery, according to the thickness of his skin, until his flesh turns white, and his color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with herb powder, and lentil oil with rose, and leaves of arnoside, and pigeon's blood, and hyndigo's blood: let each part be a piece, these things shall be mixed and laid on a cloth, and shall adhere to the place until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	The way of cauterizing in cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter 22
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop its spread: then cauterize him with a circular cautery according to the shape of his face as it has turned.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	But the wise have said that he should be cauterized with a final cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But I do not see that thing: for I am afraid that it will ulcerate: and I have seen it sometimes.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that he should be cauterized around his face with a circle, as we have said: or with many cautery tools.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	The way of cauterizing in adubelas.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 23
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When anyone has adubelas, and it is delayed in its maturation, or because it is doing something unnecessary to it, or because of age and weakness, when it lacks a little blood, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of Adubelati: then cauterize him around his face with a few small cautery tools by piercing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then let go of her.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For she will hasten in its maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you wish to pierce her with a cautery, then take this kind of fire cautery.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And lay the cautery on top of Adubelati until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery follow him who is ill, that he may bring relief to the course of blood.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then the care is for himself until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	The way of cauterizing a corroding evil.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIIII.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	The corrodent is not anything but corruption in a walking member, and it corrupts itself: as fire devours dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If you see a corrodent in a place where the cautery with fire is applied, then many cauteries, small and great, will burn there, according as it fits that place where the corrodent is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize him in every part until you have eradicated the whole corruption, and leave nothing of it within.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave him for three days, and put sulfur tratum with oil on the places that have been cauterized until all the scabs have been eradicated, and all corruption.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then the care for him is with the application of fat-forming unction.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If you see that after three days meat is born with a healthy birth, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then apply the cautery repeatedly to what remains of the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And the corrodent is sometimes healed with sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it rises again in the place of the cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, the cautery with fire is quicker in its action; and I have indeed already said that the application of sharp medicine is a division of the cauterization: so take it then whenever you can bear it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	The way of cauterizing in Clauis and Verucis.
Caput LV.	Chapter LV.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This affliction often occurs in the lower parts of the feet; and it is a gross, filtered, infection that affects the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And there are two ways of applying the cauterization: cauterization with fire, and cauterization with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for the application of fire, so that it is similar to the spark of a small torch: let it be made from iron according to how much it contains a clauum (a drop) on all sides: and let it be below the edge.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then lay the burned flesh down upon a slab of stone.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then, with the cauldron, turn your hand around the edge of the slab until the cauldron reaches the depth of the slab; and let it rest for three days, until the pus begins to come out.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then, set a piece of plaster on the flesh with soft strips, crushed with salt; and let it lie upon the flesh during the night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will itself be removed from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then, care for the place with a generous ointment of meat, until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not turned, and often happen on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet; then administer to them a cauldron with hot water: and there is, as if you take a tube of brass, or iron, or a quill feather: and lay it down upon a slab, or an athorl.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour into the tube a small quantity of hot water: hold your hand over it, and turn it slightly so that the edge of the tube is pressed into the root of the slab, and there is hot water ready to flow down to the root of the slab: and let the sick person wait a little while on the sting of the hot water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then let go of the flesh, for the slab will be removed with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do so with one at a time, until you have finished with all that are in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then care for them after they are removed, with that same ointment which generates meat.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	The mode of cauterizing in a tremor:
Caput LVI.	Head LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to anyone, a tremor from cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or any other: then it is necessary that he cauterize the flesh four times, or five on top of the spine, and between every rib with cauterization, and in his heart with cauterization, and on his stomach.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	A tremor is quieted by an oiled cauterization, and the health of an illness of cold is speeded by a cauterization with oil.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	In the manner of cauterization by Al-Baitar.
Caput LVII.	Head LXVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When also are expelled in the body by Al-Baitar pus, that is, pustules, which are produced from gross corrupted materials.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore it is necessary that at first when they appear they should be cauterized all over the head with a fine cauldron of Myrtle wood, whose extremity is heated with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or when a long root of Aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or when a cauldron of lentil.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized the putrefied matter, at first according to this method: and do not increase: and breaks off their superfluity, and heals from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary that that be done after evacuation with bleeding.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	In the manner of cauterization in the flux of blood from an artery in the forearm.
Caput LVIII.	Head LVIII.De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arterię in vaine.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Often happens the flow of blood from an artery, which has been cut at the wrist, which happens externally, or at an incised pustule, or a member cauterized, and similar to them: and it becomes difficult to remove it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	So when this happens to anyone, then with your hand properly at the opening of the artery, and put your thumb over it: and tighten it very much, until the blood is obstructed under your thumb, and does not emerge from it anything.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put in fire a small oil cauldron, and a great number of them: and blow over it until they glow brightly.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take from them one, or small, or large, according to the wrist and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cauldron over it, then quickly remove your finger: and hold the cauldron, until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If if should be removed with the hand that is bent from the opening of the artery, and extinguished the cauldron, then take another cauldron quickly, from those which are prepared in fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore, you shall not continue to do that which is after this, until the blood is separated.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware: do not burn the hair that is there, and let another evil occur on the sick one.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know: when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to cut it off; especially when the artery is large, unless it is four hands wide.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or when cutting with a knife, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or when extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its extremities are stretched out, and the blood is separated.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or is tied up with a strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or are placed on the sick person by virtue of their property, of which it is necessary to separate blood, and is tied up with a constricting bandage.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	But whoever performs this cutting with a ligature, and constriction with a bandage, or with the positioning of burning things and similar things, does not give him a clear explanation, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	But if this should happen to someone, and there is no present doctor or medicine: then he should begin with the positioning of the index finger on the opening of his wound, as we have told you, and constriction with force, until blood comes out from the upper part of the wound, and is applied to the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And do not remove the finger, always wash it above the wound with cold running water until the blood has congealed and thickened, and has been separated.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	While this is being done, he should consider what is needed from a knife, or from medicine.
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	[The first part of the end.]
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	(Lib. chirurg. Al.)
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	(Lib. chirurg. Al.)
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	(Lib. chirurg. Al.)
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	(Lib. chirurg. Al.)
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	(Lib. chirurg. Al.)
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	Before I begin that, you should know that this is a very frightening thing, which is why it is discussed in the first chapter of the book on cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of this, you should be very cautious, since many times during the procedure described in this chapter, there is a lot of bleeding, with which one falls into death when opening the vein, or cutting on an abscess, or opening an exit for the bowel, or healing a wound, or removing an arrow, or cutting on a stone, and similar things: from all of these, fear and tremor set in, and many times death occurs.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you so that this does not happen to you when there is hesitation, for sometimes those who practice this art fall by the wayside with the modes of human weakness and the modes of disease.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For from them is one who becomes angry with his own sickness, and he is careless about his death: due to his impatience that he finds in his sickness and the length of his evil.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when the sickness is from fear which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And from them is one who gives you a gift, and promises you with it, hoping for health, but his sickness is destructive.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore you should not consent to him who comes to you from them, whose mode is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And be very cautious on your part, greater than your desire and your greediness.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not assume anything about anyone from them, unless after having certain knowledge that confirms to you the arrival of something worthy and praiseworthy.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And so that you may heal all your sick patients, by prognosis and indication from that to which healing arrives suitably.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in it there is for you an aid in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O son, with his understanding, and may he not take away from you guidance and inspiration: for that is in his hands.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have also ordered this chapter distinguishing by chapters, according to which preceded in the chapter of cauterization from the nose to the feet: so that you may be relieved of what you seek from it, and where you need it.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	§ On the Cure of Water Which Aggregates in the Heads of Boys.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You should know that this illness often occurs in boys at the time of birth: or when the midwife tightens the boy's head without levity.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it happens also for an obscure cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I have also not seen this illness in anyone else but in boys, and all of them who had it were dying, for that reason I have decided to leave the operation alone in it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I have also seen a boy among them whose head was filled with water, and his head increased in size every day until he could not sit on himself, because of the size of his head: and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture, or it aggregates between the skin and the jaw: or it aggregates under the bone above the sinus.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation on him, if it is moisture between the skin and the jaw, and there is a little apostema, then you should find in the middle of the head one crease in width: and the length of the crease is almost like two knots, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of the needle.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	But if the moisture is more increased and the apostema is larger, then place two creases, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and there is a sign of it which you see open at all parts of the head: and water is depressed when you compress it with your hand towards the inside, and it does not hide itself from you: then you should find in the middle of the head three creases, according to this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after making an incision, take out all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then tightly bandage the fissures with rags and powder.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then dip it in wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the ligaments, and treat the tendon with linen bandages and ointment.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not stop tightening the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick on dry food with little moisture, until the member is comfortable and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	Another type of incision is when you consider where the build-up of blood appears, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For when it is deeper in the occipital, or in the scalp, or on the right or left side.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	So then with the incision where you see the build-up of blood and the filling of water: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And be careful not to hit an artery, or cause a flow of blood, and the sick person dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Of the incisions on the arteries that are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Head 2.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When a catarrh happens to the eyes, or to the chest, and it does not respond to medicinal treatment: then the last resort is to make an incision in these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	It is necessary that you make the incision when the sick person's head is swollen.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then clean the place with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the sick person should bend their neck and tie it with any cloth they have.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the pulse is thumping.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places are those that are behind the ears depressed: and rarely hidden, unless in some people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark them with cautery on both sides: and make an incision on each one with a scalpel so that it reaches to the bone: and let it be made at the base of the skull.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert a scalpel under the artery, and make an incision towards the top with another incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And the length of the incision is as much as two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	Nam when the new wound is incised, blood exits with a pulsatile flow, which climbs to the inside with a frequent leap.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	But if the artery does not appear to the touch, then one should measure from the navel the amount of space of three fingers' width.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with charred wax, and find until the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what should be emitted from the blood, is six ounces and perhaps you emit more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of this depends on the quantity that appears to you from the urethra and the filling of its artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider toward the kidney.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if there is any residue at the mouth of the siffar [a kind of tube or pipe], then incise it so that it does not cause a hot swelling: then tighten the kidney with linen threads.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of himself with ointment, until he is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Regarding the extraction of arteries, which are in the temporal region.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a man that he has an old headache, or acute catarrah because of the humidities and acrimonious quality, and heat in the grooves of the temporal bones, or old soda, irritating, and things like these: then we are skilled in the methods of medical treatment, and do not provide this: then we have mastered the extraction of arteries from the temporal region, or cauterization of the arteries as mentioned.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the mode of operation in extracting them is this: let the sick person shave the hair that is in the temporal region, and expose to view the artery that appears in the temporal bone.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For this will be shown to you from its pulse, and it rarely hides unless in a few people, or when there is a coldness of the body.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it hides from you, then the sick person should tie his own head with any fabric of his: then cover the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or warm the place with hot water, until a visible appearance appears to you.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the needle, which I had made a little before.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then skin the meat with it easily, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then insert the hook into it, and extract it from above, until you have extracted it from the skin, and make it ooze with blood from the tunics that are under it on all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If, however, the artery is thin: then wrap the end of the hook around it.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from that side according to how long the ends of it are extended, and bring them together, and do not let the blood flow.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it does not separate, the blood will not rise deeply.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then make it ooze with blood up to six ounces, until three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	That if the artery is large: then it should be tied to it with double thread, strong, and silk: or with hakhod strings, so that it does not adhere to putrefaction before consolidation of the wound, and blood flows.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut off the excess, which is between the two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Make it do that at that time, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery until the tip, with a knife-edge: until the ends of it have been cut, and it has stayed in place of that work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And this work is better if he does not have a fever, or if his skin is warm.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For the cautery is made of those things that remain to finish the moistures.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	So it is better to fasten it.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, that the place be filled with old lard: and they are placed on top of the wound at a distance from the center, which has been made up.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the dressing has been applied with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with liniments, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	That if, while you are working, blood flows from the artery: then proceed to cut it off with a cautery, or fill the place with a poultice: and grasp your hand firmly, until the blood has stopped flowing.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If there is nothing of them present with you now, then place your finger on the spot, until the blood congeals.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And moisten the spot with cold water, until the pain subsides, and tighten it according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And from that which is lighter and easier to be extracted, that is, as the cautery has two tweezers: let the sharpness of the two tweezers be like an almond.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are much less sharp than the two tweezers.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Since if they are sharp, like the two tweezers, it is fitting that both have coldness: and they do not strike flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	And since there is a little bulkiness in them, heat from fire is held within them, and flesh is cut quickly: so with this work it is better in every way, lighter, and easier to do.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And set a space that is the quantity of bulkiness of the finger between the two tweezers, after you have marked the two spots with the cautery: and lay both on brightly, until they reach the mouth, and strike exactly in the two spots: so that what is between the extremities of it may be lengthened.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	Since they do not consolidate deeply with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	The care for the course of sharp, burning, and painful tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are persistent tears, and the course of the tears comes from the veins on the back of the head: and does not provide any medical cure with medicines, and his eyes turn red, and he feels a crawling sensation in his forehead, as if it were ants crawling: and his eyelids become warmed by the sharpness of the tears: then the ancient people used this operation to cure them, and called the cure Ense.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And is, as you command, for the sick person to shave the hair on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then cut three slits in the forehead equidistant according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the slit be almost that of two fingers, and one slit sit equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second sit according to the length almost a little more than the movement of the mandibles, and the third sit on the other side: and so as not to cut the arteries that are in the two sides: and extend your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of every incision be the quantity of three joined fingers: and let there be for you a sponge fragment prepared, or many dried cloth with which to dry blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce the spoon-shaped ends of two sharp instruments, whose subsequent form is described.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision that is from the temporal part, up to the second incision: and scrape with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, with oil, which is on the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then also make this from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then take this spoon-shaped one out, and introduce into the first incision again another instrument called a sharp chisel, from one side soft, not acute from the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And put its sharp side opposite the annexed flesh with skin, and its soft side opposite the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle slit: and cut off with it all that comes down from the head to the eyes: except that which continues the incision up to what appears from the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then also make this in the middle slit up to another slit.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And when an equal amount of blood has run out, express the places from the fragment of coagulated blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then put in each slit a black thread from dried meat, and put on them wicks soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And check so that it does not happen that the wound becomes hot.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day dissolve the ligaments, and administer a strong infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then this ointment cure, and the other remedies used to heal wounds, until they are healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	¶ On the treatment of acute eye injuries and cataracts from within the head.
Caput V.	Head.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When any acute, sharp, or severe cataract occurs, and the eyes are weakened, pale, and their appearance is declining: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hair falls out from them, and there is a sharp pain in the depth of the head, followed by a cough: then remove these accidents, for those materials do not come except from many causes.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the best treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is as you command to shave the sick person's forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then cut into it a fissure in the middle of the forehead, or slightly to the sides from end to end, and begin to cut down to the bone: and lengthen your hand away from the jawbones that move during mastication: until when it has touched the bone: and you will dry out all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two lips of the fissure with roasted old cloth or with linen strips.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then tighten from above with wool: and immerse the wool in wine and oil so that a hot blister does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you dissolve it, and you will see that the hot blister is about to come out: then you must break the jaw, until a small piece of flesh begins to come out.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then take care of the patient with the drying treatment which causes flesh to grow: just as if you were to take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: and prepare an ointment from it, and administer it for the birth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	On the treatment that falls into gold.
Caput VI.	Head.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into gold is of one of four species: or mineral stone, or something similar to it, such as iron, and rust: or it is from a plant, such as wheat, and beans: or it is a liquid thing, such as water, and vinegar, and things like them: or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When, therefore, the stone falls into the ear, or if there is a kind of stone not added to it and does not grow in the ear, expose the ear alone to the sun: but if you see a stone, then distil into the ear some oil of chamomile, or saffron.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction of it and make it snort with the prepared one, and cover the nose at the approach of sneezing, after you have put on the circumcision of the ear swabs, or wool, and extend the ear to the top.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For this treatment is frequently carried out with this care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not go away, then administer the extraction of it with a gentle gesture, which is called a subtle pizigarol: whose form is this one.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If it goes away with the gesture, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a subtle, slightly curved hook.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	But if it does not go away with this treatment, then make a pipe of brass and introduce the end of the pipe into the hole in the ear much, and cover what is around the pipe with melted wax with oil so that there is no wind except through the pipe: then extract it with your strong breath.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For this treatment is frequently carried out by those who know how to treat these cases.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if it does not go away like this: then take from the helkalimbat, or from the water, that is, prepared gluten with which they are bound, and put the whole thing on the tip after you have dried the ear with a towel placed awkwardly: then introduce it into the hole of the ear with ease, after you have dried your ear.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	But if it does not go away with all that we have mentioned, then approach to cut off, before a hot apoplexy or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the way to open the fracture is so that blood flows out of it according to the measure of its strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear to the top, and find a small crack at the base of the ear in the place where it is depressed: and if the crack has a round shape, until you reach the stone: then remove it with that thing which is possible for you from the instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	And then, at your hour, with speed, sue the wound and care for it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	That if the rain falls on an ear from one grain, which grows and swells: then administer its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not obey you to the exit, then take a small, fine spoon, according to this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the ablation of its species from the grain that falls in the ear, and do not do that, when you think, that that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you put many waftures on it: then extract it with a hook, or with a subtle hand, or with suction, as we have said, for the extraction of it is soothing.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	But in water which is poured into the ear, it is necessary that he should use sneezing with condiments in the beginning: and already it fills the ear with some cooked old: and it lies on that ear where there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	But if it comes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, small, soft, and heat them with fire enough, and introduce one of them into the ear of the sick: and let it salivate on the sole of his foot from that part, and beat it against another stone in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	So therefore should not stop doing that with stones and pebbles, until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And already the water comes out so that you take it from the pyrop or from the yew branch, and introduce its end into the ear: and light up its other end with fire, until it is well burned.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat the yew branch, and do it many times, until all the water comes out: and extract it with a tube according to what has been said in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction, but if the animal is small that enters into it, like a flea, and similar to him, care for it as I said in division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body which appears to the sense: then administer extraction to it with gestures and hooks: and its matter is easier than all those that are held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	But in the extraction of the wisp from the ear, when you are treating it with the same care that we have mentioned in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and your cure is not successful: then you must examine the ear under the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	But if something appears there from the wisps, then extract it with gestures or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	But if nothing appears there, then take a tube of this shape, stiff below and wide above: and insert the fine end into the ear according to the quantity that it tolerates it weak: and then suck up with it a strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times, until all the wisps come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	But if they do not obey you to the exit, then cover around the tube with wax, as I have said in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	That if they do not come out with it that we have mentioned: then administer the distillations which the old people have experienced in the infection of wisps: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your efflux be like oil and medicines that you pour into the ear with this instrument, the shape of which is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see make it out of silver or brass, below stiff, in which sits a small hole, above wide.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let it be made so that what is inside the tube is driven away, let it be made of brass which is cast unevenly.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you want to make it out of lead, take radium, and wet the end of it with a solution which is slowly boiled: then pour oil, or broth, or what you want from these medicines into the tube: and let it be in the ear: then insert radium with the cot which is slightly warmed: and throw it out with your hand by moderate compression, until it drives out oil in the concavity of hearing, and feels weak inside: and that which is infunded into the ear, may now be heated with fire a little: and let not be anything that distills in it coldly: for medicines do not tolerate this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the treatment of ear injuries.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII. On the treatment of head injuries.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	And sometimes some children come out of their mothers' wombs not pierced.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it has also happened to some men that there is an injury in the ear from a sword, or flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this injury, when it happens to be in the deep cavity of the ear, which does not respond to warming: and sometimes it happens to the external cavity a little, and it responds to warming.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	So that which happens in the deep cavity of the ear, and which does not respond to sight, is difficult to heal in many situations.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which responds to warming, it is necessary that you place golden ointment on the ear, and examine it: then if you see an apparent wound, open it with a sharp stick whose shape is as follows: let there be a small sharpness at the end, and its other part should be round: and let the rest of the stick be soft on both sides: so that it does not hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If then the injury is from flesh born in the ear's meatus: then hold it with a fine hook, and cut it with ease of cutting, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the injury is in the deep cavity of the ear: then take a fine ray of light, wood, and heat it slightly with fire: then put it on the ear's meatus.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If then you feel that the injury is with it, that it causes a weighty hearing: try to heal its wound with ease: and be careful not to hurt the ear nerves.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place in the ear wax according to the quantity of the width of the cavity which you have opened with Egyptian ointment: leave it for several days, until you are safe regarding the wound's healing.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take wax, and pour it into rosewater, and powder it on the ear: and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If then you see the ear already blistered: then it is necessary that you remove wax from it, and let it be with other wax which you have made with rosewater until it cools down: then take care of the ear as long as it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	But if there is a flow of blood: then dip the sponge, or cloth into cold water and put it on the wound; and use the remainder of the cure, which cuts off the expected flow of blood in the treatise on distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	A Cure for Eyelid Inflammation:
Caput VIII.	CHAPTER VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	of the disease called Althelis which occur in the eyelids of the eye, when they are moist and also dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore, you should hold them with tweezers: or with an implement having a point, and push them from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then put three drops of the remedy on the affected places.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	But if any blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lens cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And cauterize them, it is better after an incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For often they return when some remain in their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned up, and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	A Cure for Eyelid Inflammation:
Caput IX.	CHAPTER IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Often occurs in the eyelids something that is absorbed Crandin in its strength, and hardness, and on account of which it is called Grando; and is a gathering of coarse moisture in the upper lid, and lower lid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Operation with them is, that you consider then, if it is a Grando coming from the eyelid, which appears on the eyelid, and move to all parts, and its remedy is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	So find then a crease across the width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it off from all parts with ease, until it bleeds.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then hang it by a thread, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if you are not prepared to cut it off without an incision slightly deeper, then hurts the disease in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the crease is large: then gather it with a stitch: and cure it, until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if she is old, let there not be evil in it for you.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For the bones, they will restore her, and make her flesh grow again.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if there is a growth inside the ear towards the inside, then upside down the eyelid, and suspend the knot with a hook: except that you cut it and press it from all parts.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	That if the eyelid is elongated by cutting, that does not harm it in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the cut with salty water: and take care of the place where it is infected until the wound heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	§ Of the care of the eyelids.
Caput X.	Head X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	The axirne is a fat that grows on the eyelids of young people: and it often happens to them; and it makes their eyes ugly, and they get cataracts in the morning, and they cannot see the light of the sun, because the tears go towards them, and because of this the sight goes away from them, and they always lie with their faces down, and on top of them sleep, and their eyelids are moist, which have now been inflated by swelling: and the appearance of axirne is obvious to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the axrine between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the way that it works is that he puts the sick head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a piece of linen cloth, and prepare it with a knot, and make from it a circle according to the amount that contains axrine on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then put him on it, and press him with your fingers from all parts, so that the axrine is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of his moisture with a piece of string at an angle, and there is not a larger crack than that which is made in venesection in the deep.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or you must find the whole skin, until you reach axrine, for axrine often proceeds from a crack in many different ways: because axrine is often white when it has been broken.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	So then take it out with a cloth that you have impregnated between your fingers towards the outside; and you turn your hand to the right and left until it disperses, and be careful not to add to the crack so as not to reach with the spoon to the eye and hurt it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If you do not see the axil at the beginning of the crack, then you add to the crack a little bit with ease until the axil proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then take it out, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then dip the cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the spot, and tighten it with flour.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are those who rub salt, and put it in the crack, so that what remains of it is liquified by that moisture left from it.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If, however, a sore occurs in the place of a warm blister, then care for it with wet plasters, until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	As for the modes of Ataxmir eyes, that is, when the eyelids become soft to the eye, so that it rubs as one should not.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When they grow in the eyelids hair added beyond the course under natural hairs, and antedate: then they are hurtful to the eye, and cause diseases such as frequent tears, and the palpitations of the eyelids, and the whiteness, until it is the cause of the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And Ataxmir eyes are treated according to four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or with a caustic and fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with acute medicine, according to which it is said in the chapter on cauterization:
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or treated with Ataxmir by incising and suturing.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with a cane, as I call it.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It should be placed so that you put the head of the nurse on your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eye of the hand with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is turned well, that is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: introduce it then into that which is on the lower part of the eyelid, and make it penetrate with a thread from above, and let that be near the very hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, in which the hairs grow; and draw the thread upward with the eyelid, and turn it around.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	And afterwards feel within the inner part of the eyelid under the hairs added with a thread incident from the greater tear to the smaller tear.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	And afterwards draw out the thread, and put a small bit of cotton or cloth under the eyelid: and then mark on the eyelid with encaustic, which is like the figure of a leaf of myrrh.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it should be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for that is varied in men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For from these some need so that it should incident out of the eyelid according to the quantity, which is softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	And afterwards find with a thread on top of the two lines which you have marked, and begin from the greater tear to the smaller tear, and let there be a groove one near the natural hairs, as is the thickness of a radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	And afterwards introduce an awl into one or two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	And then scrape that whole thing.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	And then gather together with a stitch the two lips, with an awl and thread of fine wool: and wipe away the blood, and let whatever excess hang from the hairs on top of the two eyelids, with some things invisible, if you wish to do that: and if not, you don't need to worry.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	And then let go of the stitch and thread up to three days or four: afterwards take care of that.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you want, let go of the awl without a stitch, and take care of that which dries up and shrinks.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid rises at the seal of the wound and gathering thereof: but the future is better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	Such a way of caring for it, Ataxmir taught in the ancient texts.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	Yet there is anxiety about the sick person, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another mode is in Ataxmir also: and it is, as signs on the eyelid figure, which is like a figment of a bay tree, as we have related.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then wipe the eyelids with three separate or joined hooks, according to this form which follows, then cut off what exceeds with small knives, according to this form, with an equal incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if you are not able to hold the hook, and it does not fit: then take an acute point where there is a filament, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert another filament near the larger tear, and a third filament near the smaller tear: and join the filaments between your fingers with an equal measurement.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then wipe your hand with an equal wiping: and wipe the skin over where the mark is in the patch, as we have related.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join together two lips of the wound with a suture: and take care of it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	But if there happens to be a hematoma at your incision, or a fissure: but that hematoma with caesarian, and those similar things, from an ointment sitting on it.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when sometimes the eyelids also turn out because of his hairs.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is necessary that you use in this what we have said about the incision: but the suture of the two is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	Of the care of Ataxmir with knives.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And is, as turning out the eyelids, and splitting the fissure which is within, according to what we have related.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then with art make two knives, or two thin pieces of wood: of which length is according to the length of the eyelids, and width of them less than a toothpick: and you have already cut at both ends where you hold the hooks.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then join each one with subtlety on that which exceeds from the eyelid of the eye, and tightly tighten the two knives from both sides with a strong tightening, and leave it for a few days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin is strict, it kills and corrupts and decays until it falls of itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If then it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When then it has consolidated, remove the sutures: and do not prick the hairs.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two cans, which you shall make according to this figure, and their quantity in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	§ On the raising of the hairs pricking in the eye with an aiguille.
Caput XII.	Head XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in that is, that you take an aiguille fine, and insert it into the eye with a silk thread fine, and tie it.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then you aggregate the ends thereof, and knot each with a small knot well: and make the length of the threads an inch.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then compose on the eye another thread fine under it, and knot the ends thereof if you will: and make the length of the threads an inch.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then lay the sick head in your bosom, and bring it near to the sun, that the operation may be declared: for it is an operation slight, or minute.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the aiguille with the alinxotated in the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate into the eyelid faster, until you draw it out over the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw the hair up to above the alinxotated: and insert into the alinxotated that hair: if one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the alinxotated on the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	But if the alinxotated is drawn out, and no hair comes out with it: draw the alinxotated to the lower part, with the thread which you have composed in it, until the alinxotated comes out of the upper orifice, and turn away its sight: for then draw the alinxotated, and the hair also: and both together, and close the eye: and let go of it closed two days, or three, until the hair has adherent to its place, and has grown on the eye.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either join it with a long strand of natural hair, and cut it off with him; or let it be, until it grows longer, and then cut it off.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	De the treatment of the Al-Kafasi that occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII: On the treatment of a wound in the eye.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this happens to the eye, it is called the Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Al-Kafasi can be either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	So the accidental one is caused by the healing of a wound, or its sectioning, or cauterization, and similar things to these.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the mode of operation in this is, that you should find her consolidation, and that you separate her lips, and place in it what is between them from linen, and bind her, until she heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary that you use in her treatment those things which dry and constrict: for if you do so, Al-Kafasi will be worse than it was before: but it is advisable to use in it those things which soften, such as foeniculum; and dip it with water, in which has been boiled aloe, seed of linseed; and unguent with daclone, which is liquid when mixed with some oils; and wrap it up with linen thread, and treat it with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your treatment is that you should guard against all artifice, so that it does not harden, according to its former form.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have described is no other than a certain correction of Al-Kafasi, so that it does not return to its former form at all.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	On the treatment of Al-Kafasi that occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upward toward the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XVIII: On the treatment of a wound in the lip.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Al-Kafasi that occurs below is the one which is truly called Al-Kafasi.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And an accidental wound, or a rift, or a cautery, and those like them.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the way of the operation in it is, that you take an acorn, in which there is a double filament, and you dip it into the flesh, and you make it penetrate from the left tear to the right tear, until the filament reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh towards the top with a sharp tool, and cut it with a chisel from the side.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If then the figure of the eyelid returns according to what is necessary, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a radium, and put it in the rift, and turn it with it the eyelid: and find two rifts on the inner side of the eyelid, and the ends of the two rifts are from two angles of incision, until they meet and the figure is made thus: and when they aggregate, the figure is this figure, and it is a Greek letter.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by its quantity, which is the acute lower side of it, from there that follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then aggregate the separated parts: join them with wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with what I have said, on medicines that soothe and liniments, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if the Alcazars have occurred from a rift, and a stitch, or a cauterization: then you should find a flat rift under the eyelashes, also according to what has preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a liniment, according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of the speech on the care of Alcazars, when it is above, or below, it is, that it runs in it an operation, according to how it is prepared from the form of Alcazar.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it is many different shapes: and the prudent craftsman prepares his mind with any way that is possible for him, until he returns the figure to a natural shape, or close to it, and himself is infirm, according to what suits him from operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	On the adhesions of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	When this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the whiteness of the eye, and prevents itself from its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, it is necessary that you insert the tip of a radium under the eyelid, and raise it up; or that you extend it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a very thin chisel, which does not cut with the sharpness of the incision of the chisel, but rather is somewhat blunt: so that the sick person is not disturbed in his operations, and moves the chisel, and hurts his eye with its sharpness: and let your incision be almost like taking away something from him, until when he returns the eyelid to its natural form, and heals the adhesion entirely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then, at that time, pour into the eye the saline water, with water washed: or distil into it from a sieved substance, from dissolved zinc with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a liniment; and put on the eye wool dipped in albus (whey): and after three days use the sieved substance, and with consolidates, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	On the incision of the nail and the eminence of the flesh of tears.
Caput XVI.	De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum:
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You should know that the nail is second in two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is a nerve: and it is similar to a hard chisel, thin.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not a nerve, similar to frozen moisture of white color: which when it touches the iron, or the chisel takes hold of it, tears off, and does not stick to it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And of both kinds do not begin, unless from the greater tear, until they are gradually added, so that it covers the sight, and stops up the light, and prevents the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the way to operate on it is: so that the sick person puts his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes and close his eyelids with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then take a hook with a little spring and extend it upward.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert it into the eye with a pin or a hook: and make a knot at the end of the thread strongly, and fasten it to the middle of the nail slightly: and pierce it with a sharp needle, and bind the thread to the nail, and extend it upward: and scrub with hair of the side of the nail which follows the pupil, as if you were holding it with the hair until it reaches its rearmost part.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remnant in the root of the lacrimal bone with a fine scalpel or with a few chisels: and let go of the natural lacrimal tissue, so that it does not run as a result of the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes when the nail is only extended with a hook: or with thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrub it with a soft scalpel, which has this shape.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And let the scraper not touch the horny tunic, so that there is no break, and do not pierce the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, pour into the eye some crushed salt, or made from a paste of zinc, and let it rest until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the eye with what is necessary, until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not nerved, and you cannot insert an acu into it, nor fix a hook to it, then often treat this nail-disease with medicines, and it heals like that of a narrh in division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you are going to cut it, then open the eye with care, and take a sharp scalpel, gentle of keenness, in this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scrape the nail from above with subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that the nail is becoming thinner and tighter, and it impressions into it, then distil from your own urine in the eye made from a paste of zinc, or of red ochre, or of ground salt: and blur the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then cut again over that, until he has completely removed it.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a heat apostema in your eye: for then you shall let go of that itself, and take care of the apostema, until it is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then again operate on that with a razor, until it is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	Except for the lustrous flesh of the eyelid, if it hurts a lot in the eye with a great harm, let it hang with a hook and cut off from that part of it: and do not make the last incision, so that the course of tears does not run.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then put a little rub on the tear canal, or made with ochre, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Regarding the incisions of Algardenic and the flesh that has come out in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	It grows when some of the eyes of men have red flesh, whether it is applied or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches or tightens over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids toward the outside: and it becomes like the blush on the cheeks.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation on that is also that he puts a sick head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes and take all that flesh with a hook suitable for it: and hold it with one clamp, or gesturing.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first, until all of it has finished with the scalpel.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And cause it not to be a matter of operation before the eye: and let your cutting be made from that which you cut, or with a chisel, which we have spoken in the incision of a nail: or with small hooks, with which Asbel is bound, according to which his form will come after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your cutting has been completed and all the Algardenici has been removed, then fill his eye with a crushed salt: or distill into it red powder, and similar things from corrosive medicines: and put on the eye a woolen cloth with alum, so that it is protected from the heat of the apostema.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If anything remains of the algirdas and warm blood reigns over you, and a warm poultice is applied: then let go of the eye, and care for himself with it while the poultice sits.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then bandage him again with the operation, until he is well.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do likewise for the flesh that has entered the eye from this kind of accident.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that the cure of a weak eye from its natural or accidental way be done with iron: and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you have recovered your sight, for that member is tolerant of that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Collection of Sebaceous from an eye.
Caput XVIII.	Head XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sebel are little red bumps that grow on the eye, which prevent the operation of vision: and weaken the eye with the passage of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore, first, you must consider, if the eye in which Sebel is, is strong, and has no other sickness than Sebel: then pluck out Sebel from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And is, as you order the sick person, to put his head in your bosom.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then hang those bumps with a single hook, or two according to your prudence: and let the hook be of subtle thickness, according to this form, or that there be two hooks placed in one body, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then pluck out those bumps with subtle hooks, with subtlety, and wipe away the blood at hour after hour, until you have removed those bumps from the eye, and they are resolved: and do not leave the eye with the ends of a spindle.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be steadfast in your operation greatly: so that you do not fall except those bumps.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have exhausted it, then distill into the eye red or pink juice: so that its own acuteness eats up what remains of Sebel.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	But if you are not able to collect that whole object in that hour, then patch the eye with that, which soothes the eye's pain; and leave it for a few days, until its pain is abated; and keep away from any heat: and then apply again to it according to the same mode, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the method of the fork.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	¶ On reducing arıs to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Head 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Namendi et ex parte maxilli, ut in hac tabula subiecit.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no art in it: unless you find the pus which is in it from its birth, and scrape out all the moisture which is in it, until the hole is discovered.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	But when the hole is discovered, and you see corruption or blackening in it, then carve it out with an instrument, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the chisel of the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of iron, and let the head be round like a chisel, that it may be dotted with the file's dots, or with the aliskirm's dots, fine dots: and place the object on the spot of the bone's corruption.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then roll the object between your fingers, and press your hand upon it gently, until you know that that corruption is now smooth: and do it sometimes.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the spot with dried-up styptic.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	But if that spot hardens, and a piece of flesh is formed in it, and the wound heals over: and remains for forty days, and does not return to bleeding, and does not ooze out, then you shall know that he is now healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no art in it, unless you reduce the tube to the nose, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, so that you can remove the second bone with iron, or with acute medicine: and when the bone is detected, then take a twig according to this form, whose end is a sharp one, triangular: and let its wood be extended into a pyramid up to the end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place that over the bone itself; and let it be close to the lacrimal; and extend your hand a little from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then rotate your hand with the skull, until it penetrates the bone and feels weak; by this means you shall perceive when he is coming out of it, while holding his own hand on his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with the dry medicines that you have mentioned to him.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When then does the flesh grow and the place harden: at that time the matter which is pouring out to the exterior returns to the nose: so it is easier on him who has been weakened.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	De reductione eminentiae oculi.
Caput XX.	The Reduction of Ocular eminence.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye emerges with all its parts and does not cause injury to the vision or decrease in it: then you should loosen the affected part: afterwards you should bleed him: after that, place the windy ones on the skin without scraping, but with a vacuum.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place over the eye a liniment made from acacia, and aloe, and incense, and ox-blood-wort.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then tighten the eye slightly above the plaster with powdered things.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of the powdery things is this: that you take soft cloths, many, and double all of them together; make them of a number; then place them one on top of the other, according to the quantity which the eye requires: then tighten them strongly above them with a hard cloth.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And again place the windy ones without scraping.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the windy ones, and release the eye, tightening it during the day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If then the ligature again softens, you should tighten it much; afterwards remove the ligature after a day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If then you see that the eye has already been re-closed with new liniment, this is good: and if not, then again place the plaster, and powdery things, and tightening, and windy ones, until it is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	¶ On the Incision of the King's Tunics.
Caput XXI.	De incisionieVuaetunicae.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture occurs in the King's tunic, then let it be cut and removed outside the eyelids like a grain of wheat, and let it be fed in the form of a man because of that, and let it be incised: then the operation is, according to what I say: and it is, so that you introduce an aiguille in the root of the King from below towards above.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another one in which there is a double thread from the part of the eye, and let it penetrate: then let go of the first one according to its disposition.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then incise the place of the double thread, and bind with it the side of the King around the acu: and tighten it much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then extract it now, and place over the eye wool steeped in alum on the membrane: then let go of it, until the thread falls with the King.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with it, which comforts itself, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the King is tightened from all sides with a circle of cloth, so that the eye adds a great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then is pierced with a sharp stylus, which reaches to the depth of the eye, and runs the alum-moisture, and goes down the eye, and enters immediately: then tighten it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	De cure for the King's eye.
Caput XXII.	De cura Vuaem Alcoitati.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This illness which is called the King' eye, is not otherwise than a grit that gathers in the eye, similar to water that has fallen down, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the mode of operation in it is, so that you make the sick sit on a prepared seat, or directly facing.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head with your hands from the two parts, and move it so that you feel the grit coming to the lower eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then fix it, and let it not fall down, and clear the light: and let the sick person see things as they are: and if it does not fall down below, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if the descent of the sap is not prepared with him as we have said, then make the sick sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a thin needle and find it with him just above the granular layer a little toward the edge of the connective tissue that joins the corneal layer on the crown, until the sap comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it has come out, then distil into the eye a warm water in which you have mixed honey: or wheat grass and honey: and then let it be cared for with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	Of the care of the water that has come into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already spoken about the kinds of water, and what is fitting for the spoken word that reveals and explains, then take it again according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then you should make the sick person sit between your hands square, opposite the light, near the sun; and bind the eye that has the water, and tighten it well: then shut the palpebra of the eye with your right hand, if the water is in the left eye, or with your left hand, if the water is in the right eye.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand almagre, if the eye is on the left; or with your left hand, if the eye is on the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then put the end of the almagre next to the crown by its thickness on the apparent lachrymal skin of the eye; then push the almagre with force: and you should rub it with your hand, until it enters into the eye's membrane: and you shall feel that the almagre has already reached the watery part.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is fitting that the length of the almagre to the depth be a measure of the space from the pupil to the end of the darkness: and the crown of the eye is there.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see them in the same pupil with a bright sight of the corneal layer, because of its transparency.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then put the almagre until it is in the place where the water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press the lower one side with a force of one, after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If then water has descended at once, then at once the sick man sees that which opens his visum at once, and almagra in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then you rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If then water has descended, then lay it down second, except that the almagra should come out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When then is fixed, and does not rise: then draw out the almagra with ease: and you unroll your hand little by little.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve in water some of the clear salt of the gem: and wash with it the inner eye.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put outside the whole stuppum, or a wool infused with rose-oil and with albus; and bind it with it the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we and those who are of our time, put on him ground pepper mixed with albus.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	That if he does not obey you the almagra for the entry into the eye because of its hardness, since it is of a man, whose eye is very hard: then you should take a staff, which is called Alberid, whose this is form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Then open with it the same connection only, and not at the last your hand in the hole: and is there is no other than to make a way for the almagra a soft place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almagra, according to what we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And near the end of your work, is prepared for the sick man an awkward bed, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark house: and let be forbidden all movements, and coughing: and put his food which he may heal nature: and should not move his head to the right, or at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And sit a ligature according to its disposition until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then solve it in that dark house, and test his vision: and let him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligaments until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary that he should do this during the time of cure, or immediately after the incisions are made: but it is necessary that he should keep it away: for water rises quickly through a wrinkled surface.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if a fever should come on: then it is necessary that you should keep his eye open until the seventh day: and straightened out let him be with him who watches over his eye while he sleeps: then absolve his flow of urine, and put it on the face of his mouth where it flows under him for some days, while he remains in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him go out of the house gradually, and let him walk about in his rooms.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that a student is not to be trusted with regard to the sight sometimes: for then he may dare to speak about the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And already has come to us some of those from Al-Ayyaram who said that it was done in Al-Ayyaram a hole through which water is drawn up.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But truly I have not seen anyone in the land of the Arabs who did this thing: nor is it written about it in any of the old books: and it may be that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of eyes from the wound, so that they stand on her who does not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of pure brass: and let their ends be with this same subtle triangle, and the sharp end.
Formae magda.	The forms of eyes.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	Regarding the cure for a birthmark on the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Head XXXXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	When they are born in the nose various meats, from which something is mixed that resembles a scorpion with many feet: and from this is the flesh of cancer, peaty, of dull color: and from this is that dull flesh, not peaty in color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	So then from these meats that are dull, not deceitful, and not cancerous, you should make him sit with his hands opposite the sun, and open his nostrils, and insert hooks into those meats: then draw them out towards the outside, and cut off whatever you have held with a sharp, fine knife, until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If something remains after the cut, for which it is not possible to close: then cut it with a slender instrument easily, until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If, however, blood controls you, or if a feverish ecstasy occurs: then resist it with what is necessary; or if it is a malign apostema, then approach it by cauterizing it, until the blood is cut off and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then let it be poured into the nose after incision with vinegar, or water, or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	But if the nose is opened, and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then you shall know that he is already well.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you shall know that flesh has been born within the upper bones of the nose, to which the incision instrument does not reach.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then let you insert a thread of linen which has some thickness, and mark in it many knots; and place between each knot the quantity of a finger, or less: and let him bring his sick person so that he holds one end of the thread in his nose with a beam, or with whatever is possible for him to do after he has made himself similar to a nose hook: and let him pull his odor at the other end until it reaches his throat, and let him come out over his tongue.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many times this boy of yours in school makes the nose hook similar: and it is an easy thing for him who wants to do it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then let you place the two ends of the thread, one end that comes out over the nose, and the other that remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then let you tie a knot in the thread to secure the flesh with the knots in the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Let him do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then let you pull out the thread: and put in the nose after the blood has stopped flowing that liquid which you imbibed in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remained of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place in the end of the matter a cannula of lead, for several days, until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If, however, the cure is slow, use the cautery.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For making a nosepiece, when oil is distilled with other medicines in the nose, make it of silver or brass; that it be like a little lamp, open like a shell-fish: and its aperture also.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish to make a closed cannula, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for making a nosepiece be full, and well-closed: which has a handle at the end, that you may hold it, when you heat oil in it, or what you wish to put into it, and fluid substances.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the shape of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the treatment of nosebleeds.
Caput XXV.	Head 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Often, in the extreme of the nose, the Thezul [blood] is born and becomes large, and grows greater with the days, until it looks like a mass.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of this, you should cut off all of it when it first appears, and tear out all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place on the spot, or the cauterizing, or the burning medicine that stands in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If, however, the cutting fails to be effective until it has become large, then examine it, if it is hard, and of a dull color, and of little smell: then do not touch it with iron: for it is a cancerous growth.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	Often, when the wind blows upon the nose, and a sore comes upon the flesh, and there grows up from it a great evil growth.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the sore is not of a violent touch, is not of a dull color, and you see that the cutting may be possible throughout all of it, then wash it with a warm water, and cut it off without fear or dread: and cure the place along with it, when it has dried up and shrunk, until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On sewing up the nose, lips, and ears.
Caput XXVI.	Chapitre XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Tu scis quia quando accidit solutionis continuitatis in una harum cartilagineam, parum convenit in ea operatione, nisi in quibusdam homine.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Il faut donc, lorsque cela arrive à quelqu'un, de considérer s'il s'agit d'une lésion récente avec du sang : alors, coudre la plaie avec des points de suture, puis prendre soin de la blessure jusqu'à ce qu'elle guérisse.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	Et s'il y a une rupture de la continuité entre les lèvres, et qu'une partie saine reste séparée: alors il faut retirer toute la partie visible de la peau, jusqu'à ce qu'elle saigne à nouveau.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Puis coudre les deux lèvres ensemble, les serrer et les appliquer avec de la poudre de dragon rouge et de l'encens broyé: poser sur la poudre un morceau d'embossement de diafinique, et un autre morceau d'embossement consolidé: et laisser ainsi le patient ligoté pendant deux jours, ou trois.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Puis dissoudre le bandage, et changer la medicamentation: et laisser ainsi le patient jusqu'à ce que les fils se détachent d'eux-mêmes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Alors prenez soin du patient avec de l'onguent, jusqu'à ce qu'il guérir.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	La méthode de la suture est de rassembler la solution de continuité, ou avec les os, comme nous l'avons mentionné dans la suture de l'œil: ou de rassembler la solution avec un fil, comme je vous ai enseigné.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	La mode de l'extraction des nœuds des lèvres
Caput XXVII.	Chapitre XXVII.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Il arrive souvent à plusieurs hommes d'avoir dans le centre des lèvres une dureté semblable à de petits grains d'herbe: et certains plus petits, et d'autres plus gros.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Il faut donc ouvrir les lèvres, trouver tous les nœuds et les suspendre avec une pince, puis faire tomber le patient de tout côté.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Puis remplir la place ainsi incisée avec du gingembre broyé, trois fois, jusqu'à ce que le sang soit absorbé.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then the wound is washed with vinegar, and the place is cleaned with it until the sores heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	Now if there is a sore on the skin, incise it and clean it with vinegar.
Caput XXVIII.	CAPUT XXXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	A frequent wound that arises on the gum is what the ancients call abluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	It should be suspended from a hook; or you should hold it with tweezers and cut it near its root and let the blood flow, or let the blood run.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then put on the wound a powder of saltpetre, or other powders that dry up, to wither it away.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	That if that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does, cut it again and caustice it; because it will not return after the caustic.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	Now regarding the cutting of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	CAPUT XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When the teeth are gathered together on the surface from within and from the outside, and between the gums there are sharp tissues, and sometimes they corrode and turn yellow, causing the teeth to rot through that corruption that reaches the gum, until finally they fall out.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Then it is necessary that you sit the sick person between your hands and set his head in your lap, and rasp away the rotten part and the tooth on which you see the gums, and make it like sand: until there is nothing left of it, and likewise do with regard to blackening, yellowing, turning citrines, and any other disease until they are cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	But if that which is in them from the beginning of the cutting away is removed, it is good: but if not, then cut them again on the second day and on the third, until you have finished your work in them with regard to the rasping.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And you should know that the tooth keeps the rasp for a long time in different shapes and forms: moreover, that the rasp with which it is shaved from below is different from the rasp with which it is shaved between the teeth, according to the different shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of razors are prepared for you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	¶ On the extraction of pain from teeth.
Caput XXX.	Head 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that you cure the tooth from its pain with all skill, and be hasty in its eradication.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	It is not that the tooth is to be supplied when eradicated: for it is substantial: until such time as there is no excuse for the eradication of it, then it is necessary that, when it is considered, it is made firm and certified with you, pain-suffering teeth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For many times the pain deceives the sick person, and he thinks that it is in the tooth and eradicates it: then the pain does not retreat, until the tooth that is ill is eradicated.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have now seen this from the operation of blood-letting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	And when the pain-suffering teeth are certified with you, then it is necessary that you sacrifice the surrounding flesh of the tooth with the spatulum, in which there is some strength, until it is healed completely: and then move it with your fingers or with subtle forceps little by little, until it is cut.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then at that place then make deep wounds with good position, and the head of the wound between your knees: which you have held firmly so that it does not move: and then pull out the tooth after its straightness, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If then it does not come out, then take one of its instruments and push it under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If then the tooth is pierced or corroded: then it is necessary that you fill that cavity with cloth: and tighten it with a small radius of forceps, so that it does not break at the time of your clamping on top of it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you do carefully the sacrifice in the surrounding flesh of the gum completely.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And guard your strength so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns to the sick one from its greater evil at first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And be careful, do not do what the phlebotomators do, when they are in a hurry and their boldness leads them to eradicate it, except that they administer what we have said.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For often they bring upon men great diseases, of which it is harder to break than to eradicate, and they leave all the roots of them, or some of their parts: or else they take it out with some of the bones of the mandible: as we have often been witness to this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then let it be rinsed after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	What if a flow of blood should come from the place (for often it happens): then wipe some of the soil off, and fill it with it: and if it does not do you any good, cauterize it, if it does not give you any soil.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The form of the forceps is slight, so that it may pass into the first place, are long at the end, short in the handle, large, so as not to double themselves when pressed upon the tooth: they are as you see the large handles, until when you press them together, they do not hurt themselves, nor double themselves: the short ends, and are made of iron forged, or of a bent bar of iron, straight at the ends: and in their ends are teeth, some of which enter into certain things, and press with a constricting squeeze, strong.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when the ends are made as the form of the ear, which is called the ciconia, and they are made of a very strong squeeze.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Of the eradication of teeth, and extraction of fractures of the mandible bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When a part remains after the eradication of a tooth that is broken, then you should place the cot over the place with butter for one day, or two days, until it softens: and then introduce to it the algar or forceps, whose ends are made like the ear, which is called the ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The form of this forceps is as follows.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	The extremities of them made as a lemon inside: or like a garlic.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	But if he does not obey you at the exit with these pincers, then it is necessary to bring about a cure on the root, and to peel off the whole flesh, and to insert an instrument which is called a small hook, the shape of which is this: .
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let the end be short, but thick enough: and let it not be soaked in, lest it break. But having made a cut in the skin with this instrument, and having removed the hair with a razor, you should then take a hook and tie it to the bone of the foot with a string; and you
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	But if the root comes out by means of it, it is good: but if not, then you should help with these other instruments, whose shapes are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The shape of the first end is triangular, in which there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The shape of the second end is also triangular, but thin.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	And it is raised with this instrument having two branches, the shape of which is this:  .
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools that have preceded in the shaving of the teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also sit the hook with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, of the shape of a triangular end bent, so that it does not break; and let it not be soaked in, lest it break. But having made a cut in the skin with this instrument, you should then take a small hook
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And you should know that there are many instruments for the teeth: and likewise the other instruments do not count, and the skilled craftsman discovers by himself the instrument, according to which is his operation and the disease itself.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For from the diseases of the teeth are due to a variety of instruments that the ancient did not say, due to the diversity of their kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	But if the jaw is broken from the mandible, or from any other bone of the mouth, or is rotten: then examine above it in its own place with what is suitable for him from instruments and pincers which I have mentioned in extracting the root, and help with these movements, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let it be somewhat thick at first, so that it is drawn tight, or held with it and the jaw does not move and waken, until it comes out: and restore the place with suitable medicines for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If there is putrid pus in bone, then cut away the bone from its putridity, and cure it until healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Of the locking of the teeth on others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32. On the locking of the teeth on others.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When the teeth do not have their natural course, but become fouled by the form of the jaw; and especially when it happens in women and girls, that is, weans.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore you should consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if the tooth is born after another tooth and does not fit, neither can its locking nor grinding; then eradicate it: and if it is joined with another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose shape is as follows.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is like a small chisel, and is made of iron, and has a sharp end.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And your cut should be deep, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that it does not disturb another tooth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	But if it is exposed by its own grinding: then grind it with a chisel made of iron, the shape of which is as follows.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	It should all be made of iron, and the handle of its small point should be smooth, like a chisel; with which the tooth is gradually ground little by little over several days with ease, so that it does not disturb other teeth, and falls out: then make the tooth soft at the end, and cut it with some rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	That if it is a tooth that breaks off part of it and hurts the tongue: then it should be ground as well, until its sharpness is gone, and made smooth: and then it should be pressed against the tongue, and not hurt it, or corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Of retaining teeth with gold fillings.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33. On the retention of golden fillings in teeth.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When there is a knock and shock on the anterior teeth by percussion, or by accident: and the sick cannot hold onto it, and the treatment with stringency of medicines does not improve; then they are made into fillings with gold wire: for silver turns yellow, and rots after some days; but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let there be a thread of average thickness in subtility and coarseness according to the amount it takes between teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the shape of retention is so that you take a thread and stick it in between two healthy teeth: then you sew with its two ends the thread between the teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the next healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the operation on the other side from which you started: and tightly hold your hand with care and wisdom, until it does not move at all: and let your constriction be where you tighten the thread, near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not wiggle.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the ends of the thread that are surplus with your scissors: and gather both together, and twist them together, and hide them between a healthy tooth and a tooth that is loose, so that it does not hurt the tongue: then let go so that it relaxes.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	But if it relaxes or cuts, tighten them with another thread and keep them steady with it for a full time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the shape of teeth, and the form of retention of two healthy teeth and two teeth that are loose, as you see it.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes one tooth moves back, or two teeth after a fall and a movement in their places, and remain as we have described, and does not do this except the artisan be prudent and skilled.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a bone is broken by a blow: and it becomes like the shape of a tooth, and is placed in its place, from which it is secure, and is tightened, as we have said: and remains there, and holds fast with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Regarding the cutting of the ligament that is under the tongue, and prevents licking the lips.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament that is under the tongue is either natural, with which a man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation in it is so that you open the jaw of the patient at its head in your throat, and push the tongue forward: then cut this nerve ligament across, until it is separated from the tongue's attachment.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is something of stiffness and hardness in it, and if it comes from the consolidation of the wound: then produce an awl into it, and find it through its breadth, until you strike the ligaments, and loose the nodule.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware, lest there be a tear in the deep flesh, and you strike the artery there, and cause a flow of blood.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then dip it in the water of incision with rose-water, or with vinegar, or with cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then put under the tongue a piece of linen that holds the sick one all night: lest it consolidate again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if there is a flow of blood, then put on the place a lump of powder.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if you hurt yourself with blood, then cauterize the place with a scorching iron, which is suitable for it: then take care of yourself with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	The extraction of a wound that is under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	When there comes under the tongue a swelling that absorbs a small wart, preventing the tongue from its natural function: and perhaps it grows so much that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation is such that, like opening an oven in the sun, you open the mouth: and consider the swelling.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	But if you see that it is of a dark color, or black, or hard, and to which the sick person does not have any sensation: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it declines to whiteness, and has moisture: then produce an awl into it, and cut it with a sharp chisel, and free it from all parts.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If you hurt yourself with blood during your operation, then put on the place a lump of powder, until the blood is absorbed: and then return to your operation, until you remove it with its complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then dip it in vinegar and salt: and take care of yourself with the rest of the cure that is appropriate for it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	¶ On the treatment of two amygdales.
Caput XXXVI.	Caput XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When, however, there occur in the throat swelling, that is to say, glands which resemble angina and occur due to inflammation: and these are called two Amygdales: when you take into consideration the treatment with respect to those which we have spoken of in the division, and they do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If, however, there is a firm swelling, of a reddish hue, and with little sense of smell: then do not touch the swelling with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if its colour is reddish, and its root is thick: then do not touch it with iron, fearing a flow of blood, and leave it aside until it has healed.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	Then either you will pierce it: or it will burst by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if its colour is white, and it is round, and its root is thin: then you must cut into the swelling.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation in it is such that you should consider before the operation, whether the swelling of its own accord has become calm and complete, or is about to decrease somewhat: then therefore let the sick person sit in front of the sun, and place his head in your lap: and open his mouth, and let him take hold of the tongue with his hands, and stroke it with an instrument, whose form this is.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver, or of brass, which is thin like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you have thus pressed it with the instrument and shown it to you, falling on its side: then take a hook, and fasten it in the amygdala, and draw it out as far as you can, pulling some of the skin with it.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with the instrument, which has this form: this is what follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is taken by forceps: however its extremities are curved, so that the opening of each of them is in a sharp angle: therefore the care is that it should be out of iron, or of a kind of glue imbibed.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	But if this instrument is not present, then cut it with a chisel, which has this form.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Sit the acute one from one part, not acute from the other part.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you cut one of the amygdales, cut the other second according to this same form of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision, gargle the sick person with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there is a flow of blood, gargle with water in which the bark of the willow has been boiled: or with leaves of myrtle and similar ones from astringent plants, until the flow of blood stops: then take care of the wound, until it heals.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when ever there arise in the throat any other pustules besides the two amygdales.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Then cut them second according to what I said in the incision of the two amygdales equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I have already cured a woman from an aposteme that was born between her throat, which made it difficult to breathe, and very weak, which almost closed her throat; and the woman breathed through my nostrils, and she had already stopped eating and drinking water; and she was about to die, if she had remained one day longer, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the pustule only rose so high that it made two protuberances come out on the nose.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	So I hurried, and fixed one of my hooks into one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled him out, and a big piece came out with it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut off where it was caught in the nostril hole.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I made him go out from the other nostril hole.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth, and pressed her tongue; then I fixed the hook into where it was caught; then I cut off part of it, and only a little blood came out: so the throat of the woman is entirely well, and immediately she began to drink water, and after that, to eat.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	I did not cease to press upon it for a long time; and the blister succeeded to the place which I pressed upon, until it was prolonged too much and with that one.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I therefore made use of artifice, and cauterized the blister between the lips.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It stood still from the addition; then I walked away on one side, and did not know what God did with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Of the Blister on the Arm.
Caput XXXVII.	THE END OF CHAPTER XXXVI
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrh has come down to the sleeve and has blistered and is long, then it is called the perpendicular; and if it is on the lower part thick, round, then it is called a blister.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When the treatment with it, which I have spoken of in the division, has failed; and you see that the blister has become cool from it, and is thin: then you should press upon it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And that which has been added to it is round and not its length, and is bloody or dark in color or black, and has no sensation: then you should cut off the blister.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For fear is in the blister on the sick.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore when you see it the second time according to the manner which I have spoken of from whiteness and length, that you should make the sick sit in the sun; and press her tongue with an instrument, the precedent description of which: then fix a hook in the sleeve, and pull it down: and cut off it with one or two instruments which I have spoken of in the incision of the two eyelids.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And you should not press upon it, unless it is added over a natural term without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you press upon it more, you will wound the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after incision use that which I have spoken of in the incision of the two eyelids: and take care of it, until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	But if the sick one trembles from the incision; then you should use artifice in its cauterization without fear and concern.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the mode of cauterization is not with her, except with sharp water: and it is, that you put the head of the nurse in your bosom.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument which we have said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I told you in the chapter of cauterizing, and dip it with her not extinct calamus, and put it not thick, nor thin, and fill it with this instrument, whose this is the shape.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Sit to extremities of her in which the medicine is placed cauterized, as cauterized cochlear.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine over its wound: and let the sick lie lying on his side, so that runs the salve from his mouth by internal medicine, so that does not fall out of it to his throat anything, and hurts him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you from the first on her wound a half of a portion of the medicine for an hour, until you see her now discolored, and let sit the medication of the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you will take a bath, and wet your body on the edge of the radius, and pour the bath with the medicine, and insert the radius with the bath into a cannula from above, until it adheres the bath to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this often times, until you get the result that you will of cauterizing your own.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let go of her: for she herself dries and falls after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	That if you will endure to wash the medicine, repeat her: and after cauterization wash her around with a new cotton wetted in butter, and clean up with it what is from around her of the medicine: and let sit with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And heal outside with embrocations, and inside with gargles, until healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This then species of cure is more salutary than incisions and more distant from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And when she is cured a ulcer with her who is finer than the cauterization and incision: for he cures with a smoke, in this way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Sumac, and hyssop, and oregano, and rut, and myrrh, and chamomile, and abrotanum, and similar plants from herbs; and all of them be gathered together, or some of them in a pot, and immersed with vinegar and boiled: and the whole be stirred with a decanter: and there be left an opening in the middle of the vessel, above which an instrument be placed according to this mode.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver or brass; and the end, in which is the graver, be inserted into the opening of the tube to the nose, until the steam ascends to the eye-lid, and much darkness ensue.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then let it be frequently moved over it, until it is thoroughly dried.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware: do not perform this cure at the first approach of apoplexy.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	Indeed, for this adds to apoplexy; and thou shouldst not perform it unless at the decline of apoplexy from heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	But if you do not have this instrument with you, then take a tube, and fit a stopcock to the end of it, so that it may not burn the nose; for the bark prevents the steam from burning the nose; and this is good curing with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	As to the extraction of spines and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXIX.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a bone or spine adheres in the throat, or a fish-spine, or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Then thou shouldst draw forth what appears thereon, which is the object that causes the difficulty, when you press the tongue with an instrument against the light and show it to thyself; because it will be seen on the tongue.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And that which is not manifest to thee and is hidden in the throat, thou shouldst make a sick person fast before any food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Forsooth, what attached may go forth through the sweat.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the sick man shall swallow a straw of wheat, or a leaf of lettuce, or he shall swallow a dry cracker; or he shall take a dry sea-sponge, and tie it with a string, then shall swallow it: and bind also that which he has taken in a string.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	And so, when it has come to the place where there are bones, or a jaw, and is extracted, then he goes away.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	But if he does not go out with it as we have said: then use the instrument of lead in this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be larger than the radius by a little, and at its end let there be a curve, which he can insert into his throat with ease: and let him hold his own head raised up.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And he should guard against touching his epiglottis, so that it does not cause him to cough, and drives out with it the bone, or the spine, or inserts it himself with his own hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But if the sick person inserts it, that is better: because of his knowledge about the part of the body concerned: and he pushes it down, or pulls up his hand with the instrument upwards, all this according to the quantity that has been prepared for him, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On the extraction of blood from the nose.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX On drawing blood from the nose.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When you are treating with medicines and the blood does not come out, then consider the throat in front of the sun, or behind it, after you have touched your tongue with the instrument that I have told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	But if your yawn falls on the leech, then extract it with a small hook, or with subtle gestures.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	That if it is not possible with them: then take a narrow tube and insert it into the throat as far as the throat: and then insert into the tube an iron that has been heated red hot with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Make it do this many times: and let the sick person refrain from drinking water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a full cup of cold water, and open his mouth there: and let him put his mouth on it, and let him not swallow anything from it: and let him move his hand with the water.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech immediately falls when it feels the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if it does not go out with him that we have described, then suffumigate the sick with herbs, or with a tube as an instrument that we have described in the suffumigation of the uula.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, because it will decrease on its own.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in suffumigation is, so that you take an olla in which there are prunes with fire: and the olla be covered with a cover, in which there is a hole: and the end of the instrument be placed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw the suffumigation and let the sick put his mouth at the end of the cannula, and close his mouth, so that the suffumigation does not go out, until you know that the suffumigation has reached the blood-vessel.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the sucking-in will cease immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not cease, then repeat the suffumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the sick suffer thirst, and eat salt and other things, and do not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore it is necessary that he go out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument from which the sucking-in is taken from the throat when it falls on top of the uisus.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to pincers, as you see: unless because of its slenderness it enters into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And the end of it is similar to an ear, which is called a cicogna, in which there is a sharpness of the point: and when it embraces anything, does not let go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	Regarding the opening of the aphemates, and their division, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many species of aphemates, and many ways of remembering them, namely one, and one in this book: and they differ in the perforation of them, and in the division of themselves into two kinds.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	Of which one is a species of aphemate in itself, and on account of its encompassing moist things.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And a second method is because of the places where it occurs from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Since the apoplexy occurs in the head, it is different from the apoplexy that occurs in the anus; and since the apoplexy occurs in a soft place, it is different from the apoplexy that occurs at the joints; and each of them has its own judgment based on the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And of the apoplexies there are some that do not need to be pierced unless they have been maturated with blood and its complement; and of them are those that need to be pierced when they are raw and do not mature according to the complement.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	As for the apoplexies that are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Since the apoplexy occurs when it is near a joint and is prolonged until what is in its surroundings may have been putrefied, perhaps the ligaments or the nerves of that joint are corroded; so this is the cause of the closer contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an apoplexy in a main limb; since if you delay piercing it until it has matured, it will damage or hurt it or the main limb through which it passes.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near a limb, so pierce it when it is immature: and you do not need to pierce a crude apoplexy that has not been completely digested, unless it is near a limb, so that it does not putrefy deeply, and it extends toward the inner parts, and becomes a fistula, or forms a hole in its end which does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	You need to know the time of piercing the apoplexy that has matured according to its complement; and it is during a sedative pain, a decrease in fever, a decrease in redness, a pulse beat, and an acuteness of head pain for the apoplexy; and the rest of the signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And you need to make the same piercing in the lower place of the apoplexy, and it is more severe: and the piercing should be flowing along the length of the body, if the apoplexies are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in the places of the ligaments, and the strings, and the nerves, and the arteries, and up to the last in all equal places, where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When, however, the hematoma is in fatty places: then it is better that you should abandon the perforation of it, until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to the supplement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus extends from it, and it is full of dirt and dirt, and perhaps it hardens its lips, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some hematomas are perforate according to the width of the body when necessary: or according to that by which the limb is in need.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small hematomas and a wide perforation in large hematomas: or sections according to the similarity of the size of the hematoma.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are hematomas from which the skin should be sutured: and it happens when it has already been done like a cloth, and it has reached the end, because it is already dead: such as that happened to many, as the itching, and boils.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And among them are those who separate by cutting with three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And among them is that from which the cut appears like a fig leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	As the hematoma of the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And among them are those in which a round section is administered, and a lunar section: and similar ones from sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That, however, to which there is no head, such as are the soft surface hematomas, it is necessary that you perforate it with a superficial perforation, or simply a flat one.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary that, when the hematoma is large and has already gathered a lot of blood, you perforate it so that it does not go out and expel all the blood at once: but extract a part from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then bandage the hematoma until the next day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract some of the puss again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Make it many times according to the progression, until it comes out: especially if the person is weak of power, or a woman who is pregnant, or a young boy, or an old man decrepitous: for the animal spirit resolves from the animal with the exit of the blood: and perhaps the sick one dies, and you do not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore cause great care in this chapter.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your piercing, from which you have made a hole, it is necessary that you should remove the grit: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	But if there is small grit in the post-hole, or it is a flat cut, then administer linen paste from flax, or ancient cotton.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if there is a great post-hole, and many cracks have been made by the piercing, then you should introduce linen into all the cracks until they are completely closed up.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut off a part of the skin in the post-hole, or have worn it around the edge: then you should fill it with ancient cotton, or as when the cloth is smooth, or is brushed with linen floc: and press it firmly until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then throw it away, and take care of that with you which you need to use ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	But if a flow of blood should happen in the hour of your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar, after which a cloth is dipped in it: and lay it down often on the place where the blood flows.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	But if the blood flow persists, then you should administer a regimen and cure, and powders, which I have described in many places of this book, and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	But if it is in the time of winter, and the post-hole is full of cold air: then you should fill it with wine and hot oil: and lay it down.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in the summer, and the places are fleshy: then you should fill them with water, and oil, or with wine and oil, and all that cold thing.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we have said, then you should remove the post, and wipe it clean, and administer to it what is proper to its cure, until it is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary to know from the treatment of post-holes in general.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	Accordingly, I have already spoken about all forms of apoplexy, and how they affect the brain specifically.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	§ On the sections of the apophelies that occur on the scalp of the head.
Caput XLI.	Head 31.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Apophelies that occur on the scalp of the head are small, and they are of two kinds: nodules, which are surrounded by a sheath, resembling little birds' nests.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many species of them.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Of these there are some that are small; and those that contain a sort of moisture similar to mud; and those that contain a sort of moisture similar to hair and scabs; and some that are like stones, and of the same kind are the hard ones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the sectioning of all of them, there is no fear of their extraction, provided that you do not make a contradiction in the arteries when you are sectioning them.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their sectioning is such that you should try it with an instrument whose shape comes after these, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if that is what contains moisture, then make the sectioning of it according to length in a lateral direction: in this way.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the sectioning from line B to line G. And when the moisture is emptied, then remove the skin that contains it, and do not leave anything of it inside.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For many times if you leave something of it, it will return.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the cotton in Egyptian ointment if it is present, and if not, in water and salt; and fill it with oil, and leave it until the next day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For this will corrode whatever remains of the skin.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the application of Egyptian ointment a second and third time, and if you find it tolerable, trust that nothing remains of the skin, then the care with the ointment is enough, until it heals over.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	For if the apoplexy contains a round nodule, then make it dry according to this form, having a cross-shaped section; and throw the hooks between the two sections, and scrape off the skin entirely: and put your skill into practice when you extract the sheath that contains the nodule.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	But if the artery causes you discomfort, then do what I will tell you after.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And also do the same in an apoplexy, if it is a stone, from the section, and the cure the same, as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the section over an apoplexy of a stone is easier: for there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes some of these apoplexies which are in the head in certain men, in whom there is no moisture within.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is: for I followed over an apoplexy in the head of a young woman, and I found an apoplexy like a solid stone and hard, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if anyone struck it with a blow, he wounded himself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In others, however, of the accidents of apoplexies in the head, except those apoplexies which happen in the heads of boys, and at the roots of the ears, all of them are superficial sections.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or put a hole in them always from their lower part, that the course of blood may be directed towards the lower side.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then take care of them with that which is suitable to them from the cure.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Regarding the section of the strophuli in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XXIV.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These apoplexies often happen in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes they happen in the whole body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And over those which happen from them in the neck, there is one general one and many: and they are generated from a single source; and every strophula from them is within its own tunic, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the kinds of these strophuli are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	For from them there are blisters: and from them there are those which contain moisture: and from them there are the evil ones, which do not submit to the cure.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In that which you see from them a good disposition when touched, whose manifest is its close nearness to the color of the skin, and it moves to all parts, and it is not joined to the nerves of the neck, nor to the guide-fibers, nor to any artery, nor is it deep: let it be separated from that superficial section from the upper part towards the lower part of the body along a line, b. up to the line, g. and scrape it off from all parts: and extend two skin-lips with a hook, or with many hooks, if you can bear it, as we have said in connection with the apoplexies in the head, and take them out slowly.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is with great care so that a new wound does not occur, or a nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the knife be not acute so as to cut deeply: that it may not give you your hand with an incision, or disturb the sick, and you fall down, for it is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you cut a vein or an artery, or prevents you from the operation, then place in the wound a dry piece of wood, or some powder that stops the blood, and tighten the wound, and let go of it until the sharpness subsides from the wound, and the wound softens: or it begins to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For the blood is stopped by the poultice; so return to your operation, until you are finished.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then inquire with your index finger, if there is anything left of the staphylids or other little things: so cut them and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	For if there is a large staphyle in the root: then it should not be cut by the staphylite from its root: but it should be bound with a strong double thread, and let go until it falls by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old cow dung, which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then care for the wound.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the staphyle is whole, then you should gather two sides of the wound: and clean it immediately, as soon as you see that there is no excess.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	But if you see that there is excess because of the size of the staphyle, then you should look to cut its root and pull it out: and administer the stitch that we have mentioned.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And those staphyle that contain moisture, pierce them with a superficial hole: so as to show you the site of maturity of it: and place the hole from that which follows below the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer, after the piercing, the licor with ointment, and similar things, so that it may corrode whatever remains of corruption, until such time as you see the wound already cleaned up: then care for the wound with a genera-tive car-nate ointment, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	¶ On the section of the epiglottis from an accident inside the throat.
Caput XLIII.	¶ On the section of the epiglottis from an accident inside the throat.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancient ones described this section of the epiglottis, and no one in our land has done it, who can do it: and this is the writing of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	In those who have a synanche, the section of the epiglottis should be removed: for it is not done by it: therefore, because all the tonsils and lungs are dormant.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a hot swelling in the mouth, or in the throat, or in the two Almonds, when there is no disease in the canal, it is necessary to use the section of the epiglottis, in order to escape the loss which happens from the pre-condensation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we want to cut that [epiglottis], let us cut it with a small knife under the circle of the epiglottis, or four, with a small section across the width, in that which is between the two circles by measure, that it be a section in the sifac, not in the cartilage: and this place is convenient for the section, because it is separated from the flesh, and the blood vessels are far away from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	That if the doctor is shy, then it is necessary to extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he should find the skin, until he reaches when it goes into the canal: he should tie the blood vessels, if he sees any of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then let him cut the sifac that we have mentioned: and it is shown on the section of the canal from the phlegm which comes out of it, when it stops [the flow], and from the loss of voice by the abruption.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And let go of the knot at some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the hour comes when there is a fear of pre-condensation, let the two lips of the wound of the skin be gathered together, and let it itself be cut alone without the cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer the medicines which make meat grow, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	He said: "Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	Inquired Albucasis.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I saw through myself is that a slave took a knife and put it in her throat and struck it with it on a part of the lung canal.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to cure her, and I found that she was snoring, as is the snore of the dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	So I took off the bandage, and I found blood which had come out from the small wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	So I was confused that she had not cut a vein nor an artery, and wind came out from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	So I sewed up the wound, and I cared for him until he was well: and nothing happened to the slave except that her voice became hoarse: and she recovered her health after a few days.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	So therefore I say: that there is no fear in the section of Epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Regarding the section of the Gut:
Caput XLIIII.	Head 44.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This condition called Hernia Gutturis is a large hernia, of the color of the body: and it is common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it has two forms: either it is natural: or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly, there is no talent.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	On the other hand, it is accidental and has two forms, one of which is similar to the nodules of the lungs, and the other...
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other form is similar to a hernia that is caused by an enlargement of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is a fear in it, and it should not be assumed that it should be made with iron unless it is small: and you test it, and investigate it with intrusion.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If then the swelling is a similar thick knot, and it is not suspended with any veins: then dry out the swelling, as they dry out knots: and draw out the swelling with what holds it in the container, if it is in a container: and if not, then examine all of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with what needs to be done from the cure, until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	§ On Sectioning Above Kinds of Knots.
Caput XLV.	CHAPTER XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of knots, and I have already spoken about them in a general way: it is necessary for me to speak here of the difference between Knots and Swelling, since there is some doubt about them.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say then that when Swelling is hot, and feverish, and sharp pains are severe, until the excess fluid runs out, and decay is complete: for then the fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	But when Knot is not hot, nor feverish, nor are there pains, and it holds them in the skin sacs of its own flesh, which is like a sack to them, and has the color of the body: and they are like beans, and resemble a mat, and are greater or smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are in two kinds: either they are fat: or they hold moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, as I have said in a general way.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	It is necessary then, when you are treating a Knot, that you examine it and inquire into it by means of the instrument called Intromissum, according to the shape of it in the chapter which follows this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of inquiry into swelled parts, and all Knots, is that you take this instrument, and insert it into the moistened place in which the swelling is: and you move your fingers slowly with it, until you are sure that the instrument has entered the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then bring the last hand of yours according to the size of the swelling.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then take out Intromissum, and look at what comes out with it into the opening.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If then a running moisture is discharged, let it be of any color: then make him dry by the superficial incision, as I said in the other pustules.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if there is no discharge of moisture in the wound with an incision, then you will know that it is thick: so dry above the wound with a cross-shaped section, according to this form, as I have taught you: and suspend the body with hooks, and scrub the skin from all parts with ease: and guard the wound with a towel if you can over it, so that you draw out what is healthy with a knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If the skin is broken during the operation, and it is not possible to draw out what is healthy, because this often happens, then draw it out in pieces until there remains nothing of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if there remains a little or a lot of it, the knot will come back according to many accounts.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	That if it should pinch you, and there remains a little of it: then fill the incision with some acute corrosive powder: and tighten the ligature, and place it on top of the spot that sits next to the pustule, and take care of the wound with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	And if there is a large knot, then cut it in two places, and take care of the flesh that has grown with it.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If then there is a reverse shape that pulses or does not pulse: then approach it, and fill the place to be incised with fresh, dry earth, and leave it tied for two days, or three, until the ligature putrefies, and the swelling subsides: then return to cutting out what remains of the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Regarding instruments from outside for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter LVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	Of the three types of incision, there are three forms.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For from these there is a large one, and from these there is a middle one, and from these there is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let there be made of iron four square ends, so that they may push into the pustule from the outside.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of incisions, and no, that is to say, perforations: and one of them is called béris, that is, perforans: and there are three species.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	From these, indeed, is the great one, and the middle, and the little.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	Convezione, that they be investigated by these openings, and exits, and sutures, and abscesses from him since it is among them from the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are round, and smooth, and soft, as the large aiguille with which they are sutured, from citron indeed, or from bronze, or from iron, or from silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And better of them are those that are made from citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And are also the incisions of black lead, which are convenient that they be investigated by these openings, whose reflections are soft, so that they reflect with their softness to those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And again there are three species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For from these are long, from these are middle, and from these are short, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and the strictness of its.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	Shape of the vulturine, and there are many species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For from these are simple, that is to say, with one curvature: and there are three species as you see, Great, Middle, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from these are vulturine blind: and there are three species.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from these have two curvatures, and there are three species: and from these have three curvatures, and there are three species: and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels, with which they cut and scald nods, and openings: and there are three species: for from these is the great one, and the middle, and the little.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities with which is made the section are acute, other extremities are not acute: and they do not put so much, unless it is done with them that there is a iuuementum in the scalding of nods at the fear of an incision of flesh, or nerve: and to cure per it through them that sickens, and finds some quietness from the drying out than it finds in the scald of openings.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are the six types and three species.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	These are made of air, and they are similar to the ray of light, from which alcohol is formed, and at its end there is a hidden, thin, invisible line: it runs to the inside and outside when you look at it, just as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of the needle that is hidden between the fingers near the hole of the blisters: and it is not felt by the nurses: and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of the wind pipe with which blood flow is cut off: and they are three species, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of air, or yellow, round, about the same length, as you see: and let them be in terms of thinness.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And let these be the kinds of wind pipes in you, large and small: so that you cut off blood with speed at need, and then when there is no medicine present with you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them to cut off blood anywhere in the body, and do not use them except in the fleshy places: such as the legs of the reptiles, and the hips, and the wrists of the arms, and the nipples, and the palms of the hands, and the thighs, and similar to these, from the fleshy parts of the reptile, moist.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes they become small tools like the knuckle of the fist, according to their form: from which blood is cut off when it flows from a phlebotomy place, or at a wound on a vein, or an artery: and sometimes they are made round, according to this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	The care of the nipples of men, which are like the nipples of women:
Caput XLVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	When certain men's nipples fill up when they begin to sleep until they resemble women's nipples: and the blisters remain full of milk.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever therefore hates that thing, let him cut off the whole nipple with a lunar saw, according to this form from the line, b, to the line, g: and then scrape the callous skin all over.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards fill the wound with incarnated medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join together the two lips of the wound with sutures, and care for it until it is healed.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If however the nipple turns downward to the lower side, and becomes soft because of its size, as happens to women: then it is necessary that two similar lunar shapes be found on either side of its two upper sides, each held by the other at their ends until they meet in one line, like this form from a line, b. on the line, g. Then remove the skin which is between the two lips, and cut off the nipple, and administer what we have said about sutures and powders, which is necessary for healing, until it is healed.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If however you do not meet the incision which it is necessary to make on him, because of nursing unease, or because of bleeding: then it is necessary that you fill the wound with corroding submerged ointment, and leave it alone until it has corroded what remained of the nipple.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it, until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	Perforation in a wart, which happens under the nipple.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These warts which happen under the nipple are of the hard species of warts, which contain blisters, and from these come those which contain moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Since however these are of the species which contain moisture, it is necessary that they be cut with a lunar section, according to this form, from a line, b. to a line, g. When therefore all that is in the wart has been drained, then fill it with aged ointment, and leave it alone until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then remove the aged ointment, and care for it with the suitable ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If however the wart is of the species of nodules of warts, then cut over it, as we said above, in a section of warts equal to each other.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If, however, the fracture is extended in this way so that it discharges pus, then administer cautery to it, as we have said above, since it is premised.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	§ On the Section of Abscesses Which Occurs Because of an Artery and a Vein.
Caput XLIX.	ヘッドXLVIII。
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is broken and the skin that is above it is hardened, then sometimes much infection occurs from there; and also with veins, so that infection and swelling occur from them.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that an abscess and swelling are because of an artery and a vein, are as follows. Because, when an abscess is because of an artery, it is long, gathered in the depths of the body: and when the swelling of the digits of your hand feels like it has a whirring sound,
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is because of a vein is round, clearly visible on the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the section on this abscess is an error, and especially if it is under the armpits, and in the groin, and in the neck, and in many other places of the body; and it is great indeed.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, so that its care is removed with iron, and that from it too, in the extremities or in the head, so that it is removed.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	On this, then, which is because of swelling from an artery opening, find on the skin in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with a hook, then expose the artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is discovered.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce under it a sharp tool, and let it penetrate to the side opposite: and tie the artery with a double knot in two places, as I taught you in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temple.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then poke the place that is between the two ligaments with a needle, until blood comes out of it all, and dissolve the abscess.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer the cure which generates pus, until the ligaments are broken: then treat that with oils fitting for it, until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If it is an apostema due to the sectioning of a vein, then you should hold your hand as much as possible without hurting yourself from the apostema with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce an acorn under the spot where you held your hand and let it pierce: and let it enter to the depth of two threads, until you draw it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then bind the aposteme with good ligature: according to what I told you in the ligature of uvea, from both parts with both extremities of thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If you are to pull out a thread, then introduce another acorn with another thread under the aposteme throughout the incision of the ace: press, and squeeze your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry up the aposteme in the middle of itself until it comes out what is inside: then cut off the surplus skin, and let go what is bound from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put on top a little wool that you immersed in wine, and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer the cure, which is done with ligatures and ointments, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	The aposteme that happens from twisting of the nerves.
Caput L.	Head.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	As has happened with the artery and vein, so it has happened with the nerves: which has happened from hitting or from excessive work, and similar: and it often happens to them in places of support, or calcanei, and in any place where joints move: and it is a gray apostema.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color resembles the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain: and when it is squeezed with a pulsation, it feels in it a similar stupor.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And this apostema is not agregatum in the depth of the body, but it lies under the skin, and moves all parts, and does not stick to the front, or before, or behind.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	So whatever is in the joints, should not be moved with a iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps, however, it happens contraction.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In that place, however, which is on the head, or on the forehead, find flesh with a hammerhead.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If then there is a small hematoma, then hold it with forceps and cut it off from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook and scrape it off: then take it away, and gather the wound with a stitch: and care for it, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	§ On the removal of hematomas, which occur in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	Chapter LII.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Some people often have little spots in their stomachs and other parts of their bodies that are called ringworms by some, because they resemble worms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Their roots are small, but their heads are thick, and their lips are large.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And some of them are small; and some of them grow very large.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I have already seen a man, and there were two ringworms in his abdomen, which were more like other things than fungi: there was no difference between them, they were white, had small roots, and their lips projected, and always had moisture flowing from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Then cut them open, and you will find in the weight of one almost X pounds and 8 ounces, and in the other almost VI pounds; and the operation on them is, that you should consider then, if they are sickly and moist, and the color of the ringworms is white, moist, with small roots: then cut them open with a hammerhead, and let there be before your eyes cauterization by fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often much blood is expelled in the section; therefore, if blood overpowers you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	That if you see a sick and frightened man overcome by the cut with an iron knife, then take a piece of copper wire that is bent, and tie it with it: for this method has been described above, and let it go for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the tightness of the copper wire.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore do not cease to bind up lead, whenever it impresses on the flesh, until it is cut off, and falls away by itself without labor.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	But if the lump is large at the root, then there is something of fear and worry in its incision: especially because it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible that you cut off half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of the wound so that it heals well.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And do not consider that the lump which is of a dark color, has few senses, and a fatty appearance: for it is an apostemic cancer: and I come to mind when I remember Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	§ On the treatment of prominent umbilicus.
Caput LII.	Head II.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	Emblem of umbilicus from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from a breach of the skin which is on the belly: and it comes out of it as an inchworm, or from the intestines, according to what happens in the other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood which flows from a vein, or from an artery, according to what has been said above.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from a coarctation of the windpipe in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	But if it is from a breach of the skin which is clean, and it emerges slowly: then it is the color of an apostle like the color of the body: and it is soft, without pain: and it shows various shapes.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is from an exit of the intestines, then its location is with what we have described, and it becomes more varied in its shape.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	But when you press it with your fingers, it hides: then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it magnifies much at the entrance of hair, and sounds harsh.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	But if it is because of moisture, it is soft, then it does not hide when pressed with your hand, and does not constrict, and is not added to.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	That if it is because of blood, then with these signs an aposteme appears towards blackening from the root.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	But if it is born of flesh: then it is a hard apotheosis, coarse, tough, and it figures according to one quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	But if it is because of the wind: then his touch is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in that is, when you consider then, if the umbilical eminence is because of blood of an artery or vein or wind: then you should prohibit him from the cure of it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in that is fear and fear, as I taught you in the chapter, where I said that apotheoses are because of the artery and the vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	That if the umbilical eminence is because of the intestines or liver: then you should prescribe to the sick person that he keep his breath and stand erect.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then signs with the caustum around the navel of all.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then prescribe to him that he lie on his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then with a sponge wet with water around the navel on the place that you marked with the caustic.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the middle apotheosis to the upper part with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind him strongly around with thread, or with a silk cord that is strong: and let the knot of the binding be relaxed.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle apotheosis that you have extended above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	But if you find him already captured by the ligament: then remove the relaxed one, and stick your finger into him, and push the intestines toward the inner side of the navel: and if you find the liver: then take him with a hook, and cut off the excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	But if it is the opposite for you: an artery or vein: then bind him closely.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two pins, and stick two strong wires into them: and stick two pins around the mark that you made around the apotheosis in the form of a cross, which you make to pierce through.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tighten the apotheosis in four places on the pins: and if you want to, remove the pins, and let the place remain until the flesh that is extended putrifies: and it will fall by itself: or cut it off when it becomes thin and putrid.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then the care of himself with the ointment until he is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the umbilical cord is embedded in the flesh or in moisture: then you should let the abscess drain as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood or moisture that has entered it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then the care of himself with the ointment until he is healed.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	DE: Curas cancri sunt multae et variarum, sicut et tota cura morbis.
Caput LIII.	CHAPTER LIII: The Care of Cancer.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	DE CURE CANCRI: De cure of cancer are many and varied, as also is the way to cure it with medicine: and guard against cura it with iron, lest it ulcerate: and we have spoken of how cancer is generated in the womb, and of the need for caution in curing it.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients say that sometimes cancer can be eradicated when it is in a place where it can be completely removed: like cancer in the breast or the thigh and similar places from a member located to extract all of it: especially when it is only beginning to bud.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When, however, it has taken deep root and is great, it is not necessary to approach it closely.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I could not cure myself of it, nor did I see anyone else who had been cured of it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation upon him, when he is located as we have said, is, as it were, to follow on and dissolve illness from black cholera sometimes.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then let blood from himself if it is evidently filled with blood.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the sick with a preparation in which he is located during an operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then cast in cancer hooks that belong to him.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then close up the whole part of it with ointment after a scrutiny, until no part remains of its roots: and let blood flow, and do not sever it quickly, but express the places, and wipe away the grosser blood entirely by hand or with whatever means is possible at the place.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if it makes you contrary by flowing gross blood from an incision of an artery or a vein: then causticate a vein until the blood is severed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then, the care for himself with the other cure, until he is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	§ On the treatment of hydrops.
Caput LIIII.	Head XLIV.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	I have already spoken at length about the different types of hydrops and how water is concentrated: the signs of each type, and its treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And those that are cured by iron, there is no need to add any explanation about the type of hydrops: and it does not come close to the iron for the case of ear-droops: nor for the case of low-salty body (hyposality): for this is a deadly thing.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated the ear-droops with these medicines and your treatment has not been successful: then reflect.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the person is already weak or there is another infirmity besides hydrops: such as if he has a cough, or a watery urine, and things like that: then be careful not to treat him with iron: for there is a fear of that.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see a person with an exuberant vigor, and there is no other disease besides hydrops: and he is not a boy or an old man: then the mode of treatment in him is, so that you stand between his hands and have him express his breath with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the pineal.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a bent spikelet, shaped like this:
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Set two acute-ended parts, one long, and the other acute-ended, like a spikelet.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, in it there is something that slowly becomes shorter: so that you do not pass him over to the inside during the operation up to the intestines, and do not harm him.
Deinde considera.	Then reflect.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the generation of hydrops is from a part of the intestines, then it should be extended with a section three fingers wide, directed downwardly beyond the pineal.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	But if the generation of hydrops is due to liver illness: then your section should be on the left side from the navel three fingers wide.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the cause is due to the spleen, then the incision should be made on the right side: and it is also not necessary that the incision should be made on the left side where the sick person used to lie, so that excess fluid does not collect in that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce through with the instrument all the skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce into it the incision, and with your hand and the spatula between the skin, and squeeze, as if you were to wash it off: and let the quantity which is washed off be a quantity of nail, or about that place.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the sponge, until the spatula reaches a vacant place: and this is a place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then take out the thing, and introduce into the pore the instrument, which has this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a tube: it is made of silver, or brass, or gold, smooth, rounded: and at its lower part there is a small pore, and on its sides there are three pores, two from one side, and one from the other side: and its end should be cut, according to the way of cutting the calamus, as you see: at its upper end there is an armlet.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, it immediately rises on the instrument, and thus washes out a medium quantity of water in an hour.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you wash out from it more than is necessary, perhaps in an hour the sick person dies by a resolution of his animal spirit: or happens to him a fainting fit which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But wash out from it according to the strength of its power, and according to what you tell you about the dispositions of the nurse by its pulse, and by its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then take out the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	That is, because it retains immediately on account of the skin which retains the pore which is above the sponge: of which I have told you, that you should make the incision according to that mode.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on the other side, if you see the sick person able to bear that one: and take out also from the water a small quantity.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Keep this day without fear and guard yourself from error until there is little left of the water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you are ill and leave much of the water behind: then care for yourself with hot sand, and sweating much in a bath and sun, and wait for thirst: and care for yourself with dried doctors, until health returns: and cauterize over the stomach, and liver, and spleen after extraction of water: second to that tell in it what preceded.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	On the treatment of children who are born with genitals that are not punctured.
Caput LV.	Head 51:
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any child exits the womb of its mother and the baby's penis is not punctured, or has a narrow opening, or is in an wrong place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Then the child should be helped with a needle and sharp string immediately after birth, according to this form:
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put a small clip on the opening from a lead pencil, and tie it up: and hold it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When he wants to urinate, let him move, and go away.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce the child.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you don't put the lead on, soon it is possible that the urine which flows over the place doesn't let the child be closed off.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But the child whose opening is narrow, is helped with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it grows larger.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	But those who have an opening in an wrong place are hurt.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is, because from the child who is born, the opening is at the end of the penis: so it can' hold its urine until it raises its penis by hand to the top.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	And there is no generation for him, therefore his semen can' reach the womb in straightness: and it is a foul disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the way of operation in that is, so that the sick lies on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the child' penis with your left hand by a strong extension: and cut the head of the penis from a place that is right, with an awl, or sharp string: just as you would cut a stick, or as you would slice something, so that it comes to resemble the shape of the penis: and so let the opening fall in the middle, according to what should be.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And let there be no flow of blood for you during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	So he did not do the incision with me when it cut off the blood, and the wound was healed until it was healthy.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Regarding the things that happen in the prepuce and the head of the penis, and corruption, redness, and adhesions.
Caput LVI.	The head.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	For these things often happen in the penis, and there is an eminence of flesh that is not pleasant.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from it this other is malicious, and this other is not malicious.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	So you should hang the non-malicious one with a fine hook, and cut it off, until you have completely washed it.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then put on top of it a cloth dipped in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the penis after that with dye-finine ointment until it is healthy.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the malady of the penis is of a foul color, then you should administer cauterization after the incision and rasping of it.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If, however, the malady of the penis is caught between the foreskin and is a part of it inside and a part of it outside: then you should remove the part of it that is inside until it is well consolidated, and then take care of the penis outside: for when you take care of it at the same time, the foreskin does not heal unless it is pierced.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And these things also happen in the testicles, and in the prepuce, blackness and corruption.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	So you should put together everything that has already been discolored, and what you want to corrupt, or what has already been corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then rub on top of the penis after that with honey that has already been crushed with flour of a fine grater and herbs of a three-fold sifter.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with the remainder of the cure, until it is healthy.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If, however, a flow of blood occurs, then administer cauterization with lunar cauterization, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	For if it corrodes the head of the shaft, and destroys all of it in an hour: then you should put a plumb-line cannula into it beforehand so that the sick one can spit on it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	But if it is attached to the foreskin of the penis and this attachment does not happen unless the foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required on it: and when the attachment happens because of a wound or an ulcer: then you should cut it off with an dull awl until it dissolves the ligamenents and frees the head of the penis from all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	For if it is difficult to distinguish it finely: then you should cut off some part of the head of the penis and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	For because when the foreskin is thin, it may poke through its thinness quickly.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate between the foreskin and the head of the penis with a soft linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water so that it does not stick again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it with wine of strap: until it hardens.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On the purification of infants and treatment when they accidentally make a mistake.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a cure for continence, as are other wounds: but because it is the result of our work and its use is beneficial to boys on their own, we must mark this operation as superior and introduce a lighter one that leads to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say, that the ancient did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws, and is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	For I discovered most of the arts, and using bloodletting, circumcision with scissors, and tweezers: and they use leeches, binding with thread, and cutting with awls.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I have already tested all these methods and found no better way of cleaning with forceps and string than with a ligature.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For when cleaning with tweezers, the skin often falls off.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	For the skin of the prepuce has two layers; so perhaps one layer of skin may be cut, and the other layer left intact; but then the other layer might be cut too, and pain result.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when cleaning with an instrument called an alefacium, that is, a finger, as surgeons do, the incision at the tip of the male member is not secure; for it may well enter a hole.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In cleaning with a nail, perhaps you will injure the flesh, and ruin your operation; and the skin of the boy is short by nature, and often develops in this way without needing to be cleaned; I have seen this myself.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	But in cleaning with forceps and string, I have found by experience that this is good; for the forceps are of a proportion to make an incision: indeed, the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	But when you press your hand, two sharp points result, and they make one incision at a time in one place; and there results a similar shape, holding the skin of the penis from all sides, so that no mistake is made at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the way of your operation is your own, that you may estimate, especially if he is among those who understand little; for you do not make an incision unless you bind the string to his penis only: and let him go until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then let him be glad and rejoice in every way as much as is possible for you to do so; for he receives his understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then let him stand between your hands which are ready to prepare him, and not sitting; and hide the forceps in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that he does not see them at all, nor any of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then put your hand on his penis and blow into the skin and pull it up until the head of the penis comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then clean it from that which is gathered in it of filthiness.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with a double knot.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then tie the lower part with about the same amount as the second ligature.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then take with your index and thumb and hold the place of the lower ligature with good holding, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then wipe the skin quickly upwards, and pull out the head of the penis.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros.	Then let the blood run slowly (for it is better) and put the powder from above: and on top of the powder a cloth in which is spread an undergarment that has been soaked in rosewater and shaken with oil of roses.
Recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Recent good: and let it be on itself until another day: and take care of the rest with cure, until it heals.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The shape of the forceps for cleaning is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	The two ends should be straight and the two curves should meet: let not the branch of the claw come out: and the length of the two curves should be equal to the length of the two hand-holds.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	An error however falling in cleaning is: for it may miss all the skin, or a part of it at the cut.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore you should, that you stretch it out from your own hour with your finger before the inspection of the place: and cut it second by equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your finger, then take it with the forceps, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if they have gone by three days, and what remains under the inflated penis has healed of its own accord, then let it go, until it has healed well, and cut it second by that which is prepared for you: and wash yourself from the head of the penis.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For that will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore that cure with him which hardens the knot from pus, which we have described in the book about pus: and if it incises the skin above the measure and projects upward, it does not hurt him, but also that one.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore that cure with him which hardens the knot from pus, which we have described, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	§ On the extraction of the hernia retained in the urinary bladder.
Caput LVIII.	The head (L VIII).
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retentio of the urine in the bladder, happens from a plaster made, from a stone, or from congealed blood, or from pus, or from flesh born, and similar things from which we have spoken about the ways of cure in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the hernia does not heal, and you see that the retention is because of a stone, which is now in the neck of the bladder: then it should be so that he is healed on his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then they put together his feet over his back, and he extends his abdomen from the upper part of his back, and the sick one strangles his desire as much as is possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	It is calculated then with the neck of the bladder to expel the stone to the rear: why is the hernia healed.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	That if it does not heal with him whom we have described, and the disease is strong on the sick person: then you should administer the extraction of it with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose form is as follows: Let it be of silver, and let it be fine, smooth, and pointed like the feather of an bird in subtility of its radius, long according to the similarity of the palm of a hand and half its length: to which is a thin cannula in the head of it.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the mode of exit of the hernia through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and ties at its end wool or cotton with a good knot: and introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut with pincers if there is any excess of wool from the thread, in truth introduce into the cannula with vehemence, like raising.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then inject the syringe with oil, or with butter, and with alum: and let the sick person sit down on the seat, and wet his mouth with oil, with olive oil, and with warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then introduce the syringe into the penis with ease, until it reaches the base of the penis.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double the above over the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe into it until it reaches the bladder, and let him feel that he has already arrived at the goal of urination: and this should not be done according to this order, unless because the meatus, in which you inject, is tortuous.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the thread follows the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then withdraw it, and let the thread run through the urethra: and again introduce the syringe, and do not cease to do this, until the bladder is emptied, and the sick person feels relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	This is a description of the quality of cleansing the bladder with a clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When there is an ulcer in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is constricted in it, and water and medicines are to be distilled into it: then let it be done with the instrument called a clepsydra, which has this form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is closed, that is, shut.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And there are three holes in it, two on one side, and one on the other, as you see them.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the place where it is placed, which propels it, is according to the quantity that it obtains by itself without addition, until when it is taken away with it there is something drawn from the moisture: and when it is propelled, it expels it far away: second because it makes a clepsydra pour out naphtha, that is, Greek fire in battles on the field.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When you pour out the waters into the bladder, introduce the extreme of the clepsydra into the water, and draw it along with what propels it upwards, for the water is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce its extremity into the penis, as we have described in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then push moisture along with it, since that's what pushes it - because moisture reaches the skin immediately, so he feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	Form a thin clot so that the urethra is clotted.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver, or of copper; its head should be high, similar to the almond, and under it a pocket in which there is a ligament.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the penis of a ram, and place moisture in it, so that you can urinate with a clot.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two pockets with a strong knot with double thread: and heat it with the help of fire, adding more moisture.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the end of the clot into the penis, then tighten your hand on the urethra with a tight compression as it comes down, until he feels it - that's when the moisture has already reached the skin.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	But if you do not have a present urethra, then take a piece of parchment, and make it into a circle, and pierce it from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then introduce a strong thread in the holes, as they rotate.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle together, as is gathered by an umbrella: once you have put it together into a circle  - you can then urinate with it, and with oils, and water.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it in the instrument: and do with it as you did with the urethra from expression with your hand, until the moisture has reached the skin.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	The extraction of a stone.
Caput LX.	Head LXX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken in the division of the species of the stone, and its treatment with medicines: and I have mentioned the difference between a stone that is generated in the kidneys, and the urethra, and their signs in all: and I have spoken of the stone that is generated in the bladder  - which is my own case - and that which is generated in the penis: I am now speaking of it with manifest explanation and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I tell you, the stone that is generated in the urinary bladder happens often to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from the signs of it is that the urine goes out of the bladder similar to water in its subtlety: and there appears in it white sand, and it grates the weak penis, and labors with it, and often hangs.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it stands up, and goes out with it the anus in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the healing is easy for boys from that age until they reach fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	But in youths it is medium, because it is between that one: and the healing of which stone is bigger is easier: and if it is weak, it is turned away from that illness.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we have come to the healing, it is necessary first that we clean up the weak one with the cloister, which removes all the dung that is in his intestines: for he sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone at inquiry.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the weak one be taken with his feet, and be shaken, and move towards below: that the stone may come down to the depths of the urinary bladder, or sometimes may come out from its high place.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then let him sit between your hands, and his hands are under his hips, so that the whole bladder turns towards below:
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then inquire about him, and touch him from outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If you then feel the stone in space, then lean right away with the incision above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must wipe the finger of the index with oil from the left hand, if it is a weak boy: or the middle finger if it is a full youth: and introduce him into some part of his, and inquire about the stone until it rests under your finger: and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press on top of him with your finger and push him towards the outside against the place where you want to make the incision: and order one minister that he should close the bladder by his hand, and order another minister that he should stretch out the testicles by his right hand towards above: and with the other hand, move away the skin which is under the testicles in the part where the section is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then introduce the spatulum, which is of this shape.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the left of the birth canal: and let the section be made on top of it, and your finger should be in the anus: and let the section be made transverse, so that it is wide outward and tight inward, according to the quantity that it is possible for the stone to exit from it without being larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps your finger, which is in the anus at the time of the section, will compress the stone, and will come out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you know that from the stone are angles and edges, so it is difficult for it to come out because of them.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it is soft, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	So add to the fracture of those who have angles and edges.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not come out in this way, then you should make an incision on top of it: or you should tighten it with a twisted gesture, the end of which is like the Moon, which tightens above the stone and does not rotate from it: or you should introduce under it a thin instrument, with a curved end.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If you cannot do this above, then slightly widen the opening.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If something from the blood makes you feel faint, cut it off with a scalpel.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	But if the stone is larger than one, then push into the first big opening towards the throat.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then make a cut on top of it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push a little behind it, and do the same if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If it is very large, then ignorance is how to cut above the section with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Since it has happened to a man of the two things mentioned above, or that he dies, or that his urine frequently distills: then, because the site does not consolidate at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer its expulsion until it comes out, or you make a fracture of its piece with tweezers, until you cut it off hastily.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have thus completed your operation, then fill the wound with thure, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and tighten it, and lay a cloth infused with oil and wine over it, or with rose-water, and cold water: that the apostema may be dried up by the heat.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then re-bandage the injured part on his neck, and do not loosen the ligature until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have thus loosened him, wet the place with much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then cure the wound with the ointment of dalフィンicon, and with the ointment of basilicon, until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	But if in the wound there is a hot pus, and it is corroded, and similar things: for instance, if blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is prohibited from it; and it is known by the exit of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Then introduce your hand into the wound, and extract the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it invites corruption of the bladder, and decay of its parts.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and oppose to it all kinds of things which are proper to the cure, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary during the whole course of the cure, that two hips should be tied up, and the joints made rigid, because medicines laid on the part are not so effective.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	That if the stone is small, and lies in the meatus of the urethra, and gets fixed there, and prevents the passage of urine: then cure the patient with it, as soon as you arrive at dissection.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times, after dissection, you will have to put up with this treatment, for I have already tried it out.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And take the Perforatorium from iron, which has this form: triangular extremities, acute, fixed in a piece of wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread, and tie it to the penis under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then introduce the piercing iron into the penis with ease, until it reaches the stone; and remove the piercing iron from your hand on the stone little by little: and examine his piercings, until you make him penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	Urinate then immediately so that it is clean.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone on the outside of the penis.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it is broken and passes away with the urine, and the wound is healed when the sick one urinates.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this treatment has not been prepared for you because of something that prevents it: then bind a cord under the stone, and a different cord above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry up on the stone in the penis between the two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then remove it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards, remove any blood that has been frozen in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to bind the cord under the stone unless you want to return to skin; and the other cord above, unless when the cord is released after the stone has come out, does it return to its place, and close the wound, as we have said. For this reason it is necessary for you, when binding the upper cord, to raise the skin so that it returns to its place, and closes the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	The extraction of the stone in women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXI: On the Extraction of the Stone from Women's Urinary Bladder.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Stones are not formed much in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if a stone should occur in any of them, the treatment is difficult and is prevented through many means.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of these is: that a woman may be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is: for you do not examine a woman who takes hold of herself by the hand when she is chaste, or those who have husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	And the third is: for you do not examine a woman who knows this art well, especially the hand operation.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And fourth is distance from the stone; why does it require deep incisions, and there is fear in them.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	That if necessity compels to that, then you should take a female physician who is well-versed in: and it is found rarely.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If however you are desperate for it, then ask a skilled, subtle physician, and present a woman who is well-versed in the business of women, or a woman who has an interest in this art part: so make her present, and especially to him, that he may do all that you command him out of inquiry about the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	In first place that is, so as to look if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she should put her finger into her and seek the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If however he finds it, she should put it under her finger, and then command the obstetrician, so that he puts his own finger into the woman's vulva, and inquires about the stone, after he has placed his left hand on her loins, and presses her with good pressure.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If however he finds the stone, then it is necessary that she should move it gradually from the opening of the vulva to the lower part with her whole power, until he reaches it with it up to the root of the hip.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she should cut over it at the opposition of the middle opening of the vulva up to the root of the hip, from whichever side it is prepared for her, and feels the stone in that part: and her finger should not move away from the stone, holding it under: and let there be a small incision first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then she should introduce her hand over that cut.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If however she feels the stone, then let her add to the incision a quantity proportionate that the stone goes out from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you should know that there are many species of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For this is one small, and one large, soft and hard, long, and round having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	You therefore know his kind, so that it may be made clear to you through this what you see.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore the blood annoys you, then add to the place three times a day, and hold for an hour, until the blood is dried up.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then get ready for your operation while the stone is being removed: and prepare the instruments I have mentioned for removing the stone from the ureter, so that you can use them during your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If the blood annoys you, and you know that the flow of blood is from the artery that has been cut: then put powder on the place, and press it down with a compress: do not change that; and let go of the stone, and do not pull out yourself.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	For perhaps the woman will die if she is weak.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then take care of the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the sharpness of the pain has passed and the place is putrefied, then get ready for your operation, until the stone is removed.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	§ On cutting through the hernial sac with water.
Caput LXII.	Chapter LII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	Water is not present, except for a gathering of moisture in the sac of the spermatic cord, which is covered by skin: and is called sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And when it is in its own pouch, which nature has provided for it between the skin: and that is another thing, and it is called the spermatic cord, because it is covered by white skin, as I have said: and it does not form except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this branch comes from the weakness that happens to the testes: why this substance is discharged towards them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And when it occurs from a blow on the testes.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or indeed its color is changed to yellow, or it is red like blood, or brown, black, or white like water, and that which is more so-called:
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it can be known where the gathering of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	If you are on the left side of the abdomen or as we have said, then the swollen area is round in shape and about the same length as the testicle; it does not show outside because moisture holds it in place from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is moisture in the pouch itself, then the swollen area is round with a part that shows; and therefore a man may guess because it is another one.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the scrotum, then it falls.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When you want to know the color of the moisture, then feel the color of the moisture in the swollen area with your finger inserted into a square, whose shape precedes it.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to this, when you go out and walk around the inserted part, judge it as being between itself.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When we came to the cure with an iron, then you should instruct the sick person to have blood let if it is possible for him, and you will see the body full of blood.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he was laid on his back on a high place and many blankets were put under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then you should sit on his left side and instruct the minister to sit on his right side, who will extend his arm to the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the side of the urethra.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a wide blade and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle along its length, up to near the chest: and make a section according to the equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the scrotum encompassing it; and observe the scar and pay attention or gently remove it, so as not to separate it: and sit with the scar that you separate from him, from the part that hangs with the skin more: and carefully examine with the scar according to the quantity that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the scrotum full of water with a wide water perforation and remove all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lips of the section with a hook, and extend the scrotum upward, and do not touch the skin encompassing the testicles: and cut the scrotum however you can cut it, either completely or in part, especially its side that is subtle.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	If you are not skilled in incising, no security is to be found in the incision, unless water is added.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if, in the course of your operation, you proceed from within the cut made by yourself at the time of your operation: then, when you have finished the section, reduce the wound.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then gather together the two lips of skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound as you would with other wounds, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	That if any part of the wound should become corrupted with a red color from another cause, then you should use the ligature which is called a suspender, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with the suspender and remove it: then take care of it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	But if water is added to the two parts, then you should know that there are two branches: therefore dry one half according to what you have done to the other half equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal to you, so that there is a single operation, then proceed: then wash away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce a woollen cloth dipped in oil, or oiled oil: and place another dry woollen cloth which you have dipped in wine and oil over the two testicles, and press it down: and put the double cloth on top of it, and smooth it out: and tie it on top with six sutures, according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then the two cloths are taken off, and they are made red, and filled with carmine, according to this similarity: and the ends which are pressed together by a cot, or wet wool, should be gathered with a ligature in the lumbar regions of the arms: and one end should take hold over some part up to the back, and the other should take hold to the region of the pelvis: and the two ends should touch the two hips below, and the other two ends should touch the two inguinal regions, and the whole should be gathered together with a ligature in the lumbar regions of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And when this artificial thread is used with a cautery at the place of section by iron: and it is, so that you may take a thin knife-edge cautery, and cut off the skin of the testicles with it: and it is lit up, according to which we have spoken: until such time as it is detected by the white fluid containing water: then take the cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	The Greek letter is assimilated.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce with it that piece of skin, and it will be blistered, until the whole moisture has gone away.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend that skin flap with a hook, and scrape it with a fine hot scalpel, and cut it as well as you can, until you have completely removed it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And let the meat cure from the outside, so that it is not touched by the fire.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is healthier, and has a longer duration away from the flow of blood, and is better than the operation with cutting.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if it causes you a contrario in the hour of cutting, or in the hour of cauterizing, a warm blister, or a flow of blood, or anything else: then you should do what helps to ease that opposite effect on you from that cure which is suitable for it, as has been said.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	But if he is a timid man, and does not expect this operation, because of its horror: then administer the piercing as I describe it above, and that is all.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are certain of yourself through that which we have said about the meanings, that the ramie is watery: then you should make the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the blister on the lower part of his body with a chisel-shaped instrument: and place the piercing according to the length of his body, and make the opening wide, until all the moisture has run.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a cloth over the spot, and bind him, and let him go to run off with the remaining water: then care for the wound, until the blister is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	But if there is an opposite effect of the exit of water at the time you pierce it: and that is not to be done except for this reason, because the white cloth causes an opposite effect in the hole of the wound, and prevents the exit of water: then you should insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument from which the water of the blister flows out, whose shape has preceded it: or add something to the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And you should know that water returns, and is gathered after six months, or about them.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	But when it is gathered then it returns according to the same mode, and the sick person will spend his days then.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	[On the care of the ram's flesh.]
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	You should know that in this section on the ram, there is a fear that leads to peril in many dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore I return to you his dismissal, that he may be healed from her.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am recalling the operation on her, and the type of wound.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say, that many wounds occur in the bodies, from which the testicles are made: and it comes from many causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from acute profuse sweating, or sharp, which runs to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the wound is according to the color of the body, and it does not find pain: and the wound is gray.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone wound, whose color is dark, and it has no feeling.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it comes from the blockage of arteries, and their swelling: as I have already recalled: or from the swelling of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	That which comes from these [blockages] of arteries is recognized by the disposition of the wound, when you press your own fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And you do not need to touch it completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That is true that which comes from the swelling of the veins does not disperse anything from it by pressing with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And also possible is that this form comes to the section, and to the other flesh: and it is, as cutting off the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend your hand up, and pull it out with a hook or something: and free the suspenders from the water, and tie the rope: and cut the suspenders after you have freed the [testicles] from any part of them.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	But if the set of the skin is joined with those flesh, then you need to pull the skin out and cut it:
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is an adhesion between something in the syphilis, or in the thing that is between the pores: then it should be necessary to free all that adhesion, and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	But if there is a birth of flesh in the place where there was an adhesion that was behind: then it should be necessary to cut all of that, and take out the flesh, as we said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When your operation is complete, then fill a wound with wool soaked in rose oil, and vinegar: then take care of it with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	Regarding the care of the vine, which is with the grapevine.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter LII.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	It is useful to put a little poultice on the testicles, similar to a blister, with softening of the testicles: and it becomes difficult on an unhealthy person's movement and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the cure of this disease there is a fear, because of the previous memory of it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it should be said, that we will speak about the operation in her according to what the first did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say, then, that you should have the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push down the suspensorium of the testicles to the lower side.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the hairs that are near the scrotum: and let another person hold them, and stretch them out with a strong extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a sharp chisel-shaped knife across the testicles in a straight direction of the scrotum, until the pores are detected.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape off all parts, as we have said to you in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temporal regions.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then fix in them a knot where there is a double filament, and tie the thread in the first places where the grapes are: and tie it again in the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then dry them off in a straight middle section according to the length of the body, and take out what is gathered from the corrupt dampness.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then the care of the wound with the cure of the other wounds, in which to grow healthy, that fall the clothes that nourish one testicle.
Non est enim malum per illud.	It is not therefore wrong through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if it happens to all the wounds, then it is necessary that they are taken out for this reason from testicles with the wounds: so that they do not shut off their nourishment because of the incision, and do not scar or heal, and are not a nuisance to them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	[On the care of intestinal worms.]
Caput LXV.	Chapter LVI.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The end of this worm is from the section which happens in the broad surface on the gut in the part of the groin from the middle of the testicle.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines come out of that break to one testicle?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this break is either from the fissure or from the extension thereof.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis.	And these two kinds of causes arise from many causes.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Aut saltu.	Or from a twist.
Aut clamore.	Or from a cry.
Aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	Or from the weight of something heavy and similar.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And a sign, when it is from the extension of the fissure.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	This is what happens gradually over a long period of time and does not happen suddenly; it is a swelling towards the inside: for this reason the fissure compresses the intestines.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it when it is from the section of the fissure, because it causes a sudden painful sensation at its beginning: and it is a swelling different, visible under the skin nearby; and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and the course of its movement to the outside of the fissure.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And when it comes out with the intestine twitching: and this is called the intestinal worm, and twitching: and sometimes it happens with a wind.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes it runs in the intestine dung, and holds itself there: and it brings with it a kind of disease; for it causes a painful sensation especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of the disease of this species with iron there is a fear: why it should be prevented from happening to her.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the mode of operation is, that you instruct the sick person to reduce the intestine by his hand to the inside of his wound, if he obeys re-entry.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then let him lie on his back between your hands: and wash her legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin to the top, and dry the whole skin of the testicles by its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix in two lips of the incision hooks, according to which you are inclined to open the incision with them: and the section sit according to quantity, that it is possible, that he comes out from her.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the syphac, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when it is touched, it detaches the syphac white, firm from all part: then insert your index finger into it that follows the testicle, in that which is between the syphac white, which is under the skin , and between the second syphac, and with it completely break the adhesion which is in the rear side of it.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand to the inside of the skin of the testicles: and with this extend the syphac white to the top, with your left hand: and wash the testes with the syphac to the side of the incision: and order the minister, that he extends the testes to the top: and you break the adhesion, which is behind complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And seek your fingers, that there is nothing there of the intestine uncoiled in the syphac or hard.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If then there is anything from it: then push him towards the lower navel.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take the acume, in which sits the thick thread, made of ten threads: and insert it among the posterior syphac, that is, the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the incision: then cut the extremities which protrude from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then join some of theirs with a figure which is in the form of a cross: and bind them together with alsifach, of which we have spoken, because it is a strong ligature under the skin of the testicles, until no water can be sent to them, which nourishes them, so that nothing happens from there to an apoplexy of heat.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place another ligature second after the first one, distant from it by two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures let go of alsifach, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity the size of a finger: and cut off all the remainder according to its roundness, and take out one.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then dry it in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, from which runs blood and pus: as we have told you before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then administer wool immersed in oil, and put it on a twig: and administer the ligature which we have told you about.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the alsifach, of which we have spoken, is cauterized with white wax after its incision, keeping an eye on the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	This often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And let go of the ligature, until it falls down by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if this delay happens, then immerse it with warm water: and place over it that which we have spoken, until it falls down.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the twig with the remainder of the wound's cure, until it is cured.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	¶ Of Ramie water.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this Ramie water, no one dared to touch it with iron for its cure.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first of all they said that it was done as we have told you about the ramie which is with Vinegar.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, so that the wounds are bound with ease below: then dry in the middle, and care for afterwards what opens them up, until the wounds fall down: and care for the twig, according to what we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	On the dissection that was done in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Head LVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and there is an outlet, and nothing comes out of the intestines: and if anything does come out, it is little, and it returns again at all times: in truth, if time passes with it, a fissure is added to the sifach, until the intestines go down into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And what has happened by an extension of the sifach, which is in the groin, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because the sifach extends; then it softens, and the place breaks open, and something comes out.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its cure is with a cautery, as has gone before in its account.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And when it is cured with a iron, according to this way: and it is, so that he lies sick on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry the place of the rupture, where it has broken open and comes out, by cutting across its width, according to the length of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tighten the bandage, and, what is under the skin, until, when it is touched, there comes out white stuff from the sifach, which is under the skin that follows itself.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a ray, and put it on the place that comes out of the sifach, and press it into the depth of the groin.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then, on each side of the place that comes out of the sifach, put two places together with a stitch between them; then remove the end of the ray.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not stretch the sifach at all, and do not stretch one, or anything else, as I have taught you to know about the cure of the intestinal ramification.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then its cure is with a wound-care.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	And when you stretch the thread, clean it out, and restore the wound, until it hardens.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	The sifach is drawn in, and no place of rupture is added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cautery is better in this place: for it is nearer to salvation.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	If the skin of the testicles is tough, soften it with a hot poultice.
Caput LXVIII.	¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	Often the skin of the testicles softens in certain men because the flesh that is between them softens and its appearance becomes better.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who asks to cure himself, that he lie on his back, and cover all the skin that has been softened with the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then he will collect two lips with a stitch: and if need be, first the superfluity of the softened skin will be cut off three or four stitches, and a firm stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then he will cut between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then take care of the cure of the remaining wound, until it is healed, and let the threads fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	¶ Of Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Caput LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You should know that castration is excommunicated in our law: and because of it I will remember it in my book here: and its remembrance is not necessary except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	The first is, that it may be in the knowledge of a medical doctor when he is questioned about it: and that he may know how to cure it when it happens to him.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	The other reason is that we often lack castration of certain animals, for our benefit through it, such as sheep, horses, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say then, that castration is made in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Either by friction.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by a slit and a cut.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by friction, the course of the operation is this: that we make the animal sit in hot water, until his testicles become soft and lax, and hang down: then we will press them with our hand, until they close up and do not appear under the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration however by a slit and a cut, it is necessary that you hold the animal, and with your left hand press the skin of his testicles.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the ligatures together and cut through all of them at once until the two blades come out: then cut them after you have scraped both of them so that there is nothing left except for a thin piece of skin which is on top of the wound.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done by scraping; for scratching may leave something of the testes behind, so that the animal desires to have sex.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	As for the treatment of hermaphroditism, there are two methods:
Caput LXX.	Head.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	Hermaphrodite is from the testicles according to two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	The penis is one of them, because it appears to be so in that it follows a gap or is on the skin of the testicles, being between the two testes, shaped like a vagina of a woman, in which there are hairs: and sometimes it runs urine from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	But in women there is only one member and it is like a woman's vagina on top of the pubic bone like a small penis, sticking out towards the outside: of which one is like a penis of a man, and two are like two testes.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of the three sexes, the two of the testicles, and the one of the woman, is this: for you must cut off the flesh attached until the impression goes away.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then take care of the remaining wounds in the curing process.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	But as for the second sex of men, from which urine comes out and is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation or cure at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	As for the cutting of the hernia and the protruding flesh in women's genitals:
Caput LXXI.	Head.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	Hernia should perhaps be added to the natural place until it is satisfied and its appearance is ugly: and sometimes it becomes so large in some women that it reaches up to the area of intercourse and comes close to having sex with a man.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	You should therefore have the tendinosa hand, or with a hook, and fall on it; and do not end in the incision, especially in the deep root: so that there is no flow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then you should take care of the wound with cure, until it is healed.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	But the midriff is more precious than life; that which is born in the womb of the mother, until it fills itself up: and perhaps it goes out on the outside according to the likeness of a tail: and because of this some call disease that has a tail.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	So you should cut it as we cut the tendinosa, and take care of it, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the cure of the hernia of a woman who has not been pierced.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter LII. Head.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratica is, whether it is a hernia of a woman who has not been pierced, or whether there is a small hole.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural, or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is from an illness that preceded it: and that itself is either born of flesh that has been added, or if it is thin, or if it is wedged in: and it is in the deep of the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or in its lower part: and it forbids coitus and impregnation, and birth, and perhaps it forbids menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the knowledge of it is acquired by the examination of the obstetrical aspects, if the pregnancy is apparent near at hand.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not apparent, then ask about it with your fingers, or with a ray.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If the pregnancy is from a small hole, and it is near to the two lips: then bring them together, and loosen it.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, as you place it on the two lips dry.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then put your fingers of both hands together, and let the woman lie on her back with her legs spread wide.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the two lips with force, until the small hole is loosened, and the pregnancy opens.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a piece of cloth, and soak it in oil, and place it over the site; and let a woman move it every day so that the site does not stiffen by other means.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If however the wound is deep, thick: then one should let the wound separate itself with a smooth blade similar to a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If however the wound is of putrid flesh: then hang it with a hook, and cut it: and have with you medicines that will stop the flow of blood without causing pain, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and let it congeal with white glue.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a large silver tube so that the fracture does not heal quickly, hold it for several days: and administer wolfsbane dried in linen, then treat the rest with the usual treatment until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when a child is born in the womb of its mother, the birth of flesh: it should therefore be cut according to this mode: while there is no scrofula, for scrofula is not caused by contact with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	Regarding the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athahelil, and both or red rub on any woman's vulva.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter LIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are an opening of the anal orifice, until it bleeds a lot regularly.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When however they become chronic hemorrhoids, they are painful: and I have already spoken in the division of their types and their signs: and I will say here which receive treatment and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I therefore say that hemorrhoids that are in the opening of the womb, and do not appear to be painful: then there is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But which of those [hemorrhoids] are in the opening of the womb above, where the sense is lost, they are the ones that heal.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is therefore necessary for the woman to enter a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend Athahelil with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut them off at their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then the powder shall be applied upon the wound of the blood-flow from one hole incised without torture: as the acacia, and the blood of the dragon, and the thistle, and similar to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then he will put his feet against the wall at an hour's time.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then he will put it in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the blood-flow persisting: then make her sit in a decoction of sumach, and of the corn-grain, and of the crow's-feet, and of like things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley-flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore is shed the blood with it, then is good: and if not, then make adhere to her back the water-soaked things, and the nettle- leaves, without having it scarified.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take a wool, and dip it in the juice of tarthar, or of the tongue-worm, or of the gnats' wings, that is to say, in the wine of Pontus, and make adhere to her loins.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When therefore has it rested the poultice, then take care of the place with the unguent, until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth verily is similar to red-beets in shape, and has a rough aspect.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then you shall cut what appears out of it, according as I said in the book, equitately: and take care of itself, until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	On the issue of an outlet which occurs in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Occur in the womb many poultices, as cancer, and the stone-poultice, and ulcers, and blisters, and milking, that is to say, herpes, blister-foot, and fistula, and hemorrhoids, and sores, and thrashes, and poultices hot.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have said already all these diseases and their species, and their signs, and their cures in a division: it is necessary that I should say in this book of the hot poultice which occurs in the womb when it is from poultices that gather blood, and with an iron to know how its opening is made.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	You should therefore consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the wound is acute in its beginning and there is a sharp pulse, fever and heat, and you see it red: if it falls on top of it, then do not suit with his perforation: and care for him with it as much as he can on maturation, until when it rests, the acuteness of the accidents.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a chair that will support her two seats, and lie down or lean against her back, and put her feet on the side of the foot: and are her hips expanded, and she puts her arms under her knees, and binds each one with a rope corresponding to him.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit on the right side of the bed, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form has come to those who are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary that when you administer this instrument, you fasten the string of the womb with the rope deeply: so that it does not enter into the instrument more than the depth of the womb, and hurts the sick.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary that you put the pulleys on top of the depth of the womb: so as to prevent the entry of the whole instrument into the depth of the womb: and it is necessary that you put the string, which runs in the instrument from the side above, and hold it, and rotate the string, until the depth of the womb is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When it appears that it is coming out, and is touched by the hand, and is soft and small: then it is necessary that you separate it from the head with a spatula blunt edge.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When it is emptied of its content, then it is necessary that you put the chisel of iron immersed in oil rose: or in olive oil, in which there is some stiffness: and put the iron, and extract a piece in the depth of the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And put outside on top of the womb, and over the woolen fleece clean immersed in water, in which it is boiled salt.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then he should be dressed with ointment suitable for it, for two days until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes when the wound and the knot have been washed away, so that it swells up with water and honey: then with water in which a bulb of lily root or long aristolochia has been boiled: then he should return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the knot is hidden within the womb, then one should refrain from treating it with fire, indeed care for it itself along with it as we have said in division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Doctrines on Obstetrics, how they treat embryos within the womb, according to an unnatural exit.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LXVII.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to recognize in the first place the figure of a natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From the signs then it is apparent that when you see a woman compressing herself towards the lower parts, and desiring to smell air, and being relieved on her when the birth of an embryo approaches, then you know that this birth is according to a natural figure, and its exit is above her head, and second in order with it: or suspended, or hanging by the umbilical cord.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When then you see these signs, then one should compress her belly, that the embryo may descend quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it has come to rest on its head, this second one comes with it, and is cleansed from it by a good purification of secretions.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But if this is not the case, that is, if this second one is not present, then it is an unnatural birth, one which should be regretted.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when an embryo has come out on its feet, and the body of it has come out before the head of it, and its feet and hands one or two, or the head and hands of it: or has come out in a twist, and figures like these, which are not to be regretted.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is therefore necessary for the obstetrician to be prudent and careful in all these matters, and to guard himself against error and deception: and I am showing you every figure from them, and how the faculty of it functions, and pointing out on it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus has come out of his mother's womb by its own natural power, and it is heavy upon the woman, and her parto is difficult, and she is already weak: then make her sit down on a chair, or let the women support her: and pour over her the juice of foenugraea, and with wet oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the Obstetrician shall introduce his finger between her small fingers, and shall find with it the second child, and shall dry it with his nail, until he has taken what is in her from moisture: and he shall press the woman's belly, until the child goes down.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not go down, then the woman should be made to lie in a bath of foenugraa juice with Sisam oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then order her to compress herself after the bath, and let her sneeze with a stopwatch, and hold her nose and mouth for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the child will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the child come out first, then it should be reduced with ease little by little.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If it does not yield in the entrance, then place the woman on a chair, and lift her feet up: then bring the chair down to the ground: and let the woman hold herself so that she does not fall with the shock.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If the hands do not come out, and the child dies: then cut them open, and take out what remains of the child: and tie her hand with a cloth, and take it out with equality: for he will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the child is at its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the child comes out at its feet, then it should be made to go up: and gradually turn the child around: then make it even.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet, and slowly extend it.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they have come out as far as the hips, then order her to compress herself, and let her sneeze with a stopwatch: for she will come out if God wills it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if he does not go out with that which we have mentioned, then bring back the fetus little by little until you put it in its natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For he will go out then when the exit is easy.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is forbidden to go out with all that we have mentioned: then take from the mucilaginous aloe, and from the sesame oil, and from the dissolved gum: and strike it all together in a good mortar: and then rub it with the hand of a woman, and her lower part.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water until she has hyperpnea.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When you see therefore that her lower parts are already warmed, then make him put on the myrrh: and let him lie.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore he has held the sief for an hour, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze: and squeeze her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of her womb with a gentle compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For fire will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The exit of the fetus over the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it has gone out according to this form, then put your hands slowly.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman shall rise up on her neck, and let her feet hang down to the lower part: and she herself shall lie on a bed, and shall spread her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then squeeze her above the navel little by little.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then draw out what is under her feet from the pubic hair, until it is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not go out, then take her feet, and move them with a violent movement.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then squeeze what is above the navel little by little, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then put your hands on it, and make it even little by little: and command the woman, that she squeeze, until the fetus goes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Let it be drawn out in reducing your hands.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	But if he cannot reduce her, then let him send for a woman, and let her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	But if she cannot walk, then let her lie on a bed: and strike her thighs violently.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the ointment you have prepared from mucus.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	That if she catches fire, then let her sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then study the reducing of the hand, and fix it in the natural position: and command the woman to sneeze, and tell her to compress herself until she has gone outside.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	Exit the child from the neck of its mother, with open arms, and it is facing towards her back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It should be that the midwife hold the baby's hand, then turn it gradually, and smooth it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	But when it is even, then put it on the poultice which we have prepared from oil and mucus.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then command her to move slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	But when you have done this, then let her sit on a chair, and tell her to lean to the right.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then command her to compress herself: and make her sneeze with a handkerchief.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	Exit the prepared child on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it came out through the opening of its mother in this way with the second, then cut the second with your fingernail, until it is discharged from moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	But if it hangs over the face of the baby, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: lest it should be retained, and die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the baby inside, until you put it in its proper place: and command the woman to compress herself at times: for himself shall come out from the exit lightly.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	Exit the twins, or a multiple birth.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You should know that twins are often born: and sometimes three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	Indeed, this is strange, and seldom occurs.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Indeed, this is strange, and seldom occurs. It is a thing out of nature, and they do not live entirely within the skin: but they contain them, though they multiply, by two ones: and they are separated by a slit, distinguishing between them a tied navel of each one.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And when they come out, they come out easily like a baby coming out of a natural exit, and they come out with a loud exit, as we have told you.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	That if some of them are difficult at birth, and they reach to that which we have said from the figures of unnatural things, then take care of them as we have told you: and let it sit on a soft cloth, and make what it makes with ease and tardiness, and create itself according to all the figure with that which is prepared by the inventor leading towards salvation.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remembrance that it forms in the womb out of embryos, and they are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	When one is formed in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and already proven to me that a woman has emitted seven, and another eleven, all of them formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which was done by the measurement of the glorious sage.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	This then, all of it, it is necessary that it should be in the knowledge of obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps, indeed, it will come to that which is similar to that: oppose it, then, with that which is necessary:
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	Regarding the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LXVII.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you care about the dead fetus with that which I said in the division from medication, and does not come out, and force yourself to use the operation with the hand, then it is necessary for you to consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If then the woman is of sound health and is not with any of the accidents from which she fears losing herself: then it is necessary that she should lie down on a bed, on her back, and should have her head наклон된 to the bottom, and her legs raised: and the servant should hold her from two sides, or tie her to the bed, so that her body is not taken out during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the bone of the mother with wet oils and mucilage of althaea, and fenugreek, and linseed meal.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife shall wet her hands with these oils and mucilages: then she shall insert herself into the mother with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she shall seek out the place where the umbilical cord is attached to the fetus, and the suitable places for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider therefore then, if the fetus is ready to descend over its head: then insert the hooks into his eyes, or his neck, or his mouth, or his palate, or under his beard, or in his chest, or in close places by the ribs, and under its nipples.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If however the descent is over its feet, then in the ridge, and in the middle of its ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand: and place a ring on it in that which is between the fingers of her left hand: and insert herself with ease, and fix the hook in some of those places which we have mentioned, until she has reached the loose part.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then she shall fix another hook opposite to it, or a third, if she is able to: so that there is an equal tension, and it does not lean towards one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it shall be extended with an equal extension, and not an extension according to the only straight line, but let it move on all sides, so that the exit is eased: as happens when a tooth is being extracted.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary in that which is between that, so that the extension is softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	That if a part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife insert some fingers with oil and turn them from the part which is retained, so that they release it.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If then a part of the fetus is going out, then the hooks shall be moved to a higher place: do this until the entire fetus has come out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If then a hand goes out before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it by contraction: then it is necessary that a cloth be spread over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then extract it until it is all out, cut it or in the joint of the plant, or on the bed: and so you should do in the other hand and in the two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If, however, the head of the fetus is large, or if it has suffered a rupture during delivery, or if there is water in its head: then one should insert between the fingers the Spatulimile spinosa [a type of spoon], and find out with it the head, and extract the water; or tear off with the instrument called Almisdac [a type of scalpel]: whose form arrives with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter that follows.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, if the fetus is of a large head nature, then one should separate the hair with oil: or extract him out with the Misdach [a type of instrument], as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then pull out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If it is the head that comes out, and there is a rupture at the fork  [i.e., the neck]: then find out, until the moisture that is in the chest is poured out.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If it is not complicated, and does not submit to the exit: then cut the head prematurely, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If the lower part of the body is aphmomated, or if there is water in it: then you should open it up, until the moisture comes out from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If, however, the fetus is above his own feet, then the attraction of it is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the mother is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If it is ruptured at the navel, or at the chest: then you should extract him out with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand: and find out the navel, or the chest, until what is in them comes out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If other limbs are taken away, and then the head returns: then insert the left hand of the midwife.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If, however, the mouth of the mother is open, then insert your hand into the depth of the womb, and ask with it the head, and pull it out with your fingers up to the mouth of the womb: and then insert one hook, or two hooks, and pull him out with it.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the jaw is clamped, because of the heat that has been caused to it: then he should not work on it, but rather at that time administer an infusion of wet, thick things; and administer plasters; and let him sit in water which softens and moistens.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on the side, then it is possible that it will be evened out; then he should administer what we have said about the single fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If this is not possible, then he should cut short and pull out.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And you should not leave anything at all inside for the second time.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	So when you have finished your operation, then administer what we have said about hot apostems that occur in the wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If blood flows, then he should go down into the waters of stifness, and administer the remaining cure.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself have already seen a woman, in whose womb a dead fetus was; and then she was impregnated with another force, and after that a different dead fetus was also.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Then after a long time an apostema occurred for her in the navel, and it swelled up, until it opened up: and it began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	So I was called to her cure, and I treated her for a long time; and the wound was not healed.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	Then I put on the wound some strong plasters of attraction; and she came out from her place, with her jaw.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then a few days went by for her, and she came out with another jaw.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	So I was amazed from there, because there is no jaw in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I thought that they were bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	So I questioned the wound, and I pulled out many bones, while there was a woman in better dispositions; and she has been thus for a long time, and she comes out from her place with little pus.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I do not make this strange, unless there is knowledge and help for it, which the healer of the art uses with his hand in the cure.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	The shapes of the instruments necessary for extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	¶ De forma instrumentorum necessarium in extractione foetus.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here is the figure of the strigentor, which are equal in length to the books, with two twists at each end of two beams.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this twist should be made slightly thinner than the strigentor: and in order that it may be made, let it be of ebony or of basswood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of each beam should be as wide as two fingers; and the edge of each of these two beams is as wide as a finger, and their length is the palm and half; and there are two pieces in the middle of the two beams, which have been already fixed on both sides, whose length is half a palm and slightly more: and the width of either is almost two fingers, or slightly less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two pieces are inserted into the mouth of the womb, so that they open with them when you twist the two twists.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	Here is the figure of the twist that opens the womb:
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Here is another figure similar to it, but thinner and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made of ebony wood or basswood, according to the similarity of the forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at the end of it there are two pieces, as you see here above; and the length of each of these pieces is almost a palm; and the width of either is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When you want to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, her feet hanging down from the bed, and open what is between her thighs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two pieces joined together into the womb; and you should hold the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with the forceps, evenly according to the quantity that you want from the opening of the womb's mouth; until the Obstetrix does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	Here is the figure of the other twist, which the ancient sayers called the propelling one, by which the fetus is propelled:
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	Form of al-Misdad, who is healing the great head: and he makes it like a plier, which has teeth on the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it is made round, as a plier, according to this form, as you see, which has teeth like serrated teeth, so that it cuts and presses.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	Form of al-Misdad who is healing the small head.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	Form of One-spined Winch.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	Form of Two-spined Winch.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	Form of plier which has serrated teeth, with which the fetus is pressed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	Form of Scissor having two extremities to cut off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	Form of two scissoring arms which also hold and support.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	This instruments all are used, and the more they multiply in their kind, and are prepared by the artisan, the faster they are in their work, and the higher among men because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore do not despise these instruments, although they are made by you, who are prepared, while they are used by others because of their efficiency and convenience.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For there is no excuse for their necessity.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	On the Extraction of the Second.
Caput LXXVIII.	Head 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the Second is retained after delivery, then you should take care that it does not retain its weak position, so that it can breathe easily.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then you shall make her sneeze with a device, and tightly grip your hand upon its nose.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If then she exits through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a staff, and pierce through the lid with it; and place in it herbs opening up the nose, such as yarrow, chamomile, fennel, mint, saffron, and marshmallow, and caraway; take any of these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them with water, and put them by fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place an arrow of willow (bough) over the hole of the pot, and a second end within the nose; and let her hold it until the steam from the opening of the nose has dried up.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then I make her sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the second time she will come out with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	But if after this cure she still remains and does not go out: then direct the obstetrician to dip his hand in sesame oil, or mucilaginous aloe.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then he enters into the vagina, and asks her if she feels any pain.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	But when he has found her, then he takes her and extends her little by little.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	But if she is attached deep within the uterus, then he enters his hand, following what we have described, until he finds the Secundina, and slowly pulls her out according to the right direction so that the matrix does not get caught on the strong pull: it should be, so that it can be changed easily from the left and right sides: then the quantity of the pull is added.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	She herself will obey then, and move away, and free herself from the adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	But if the os of the uterus is constricted, as we have already described: take care of her with sneezing, and after the medicine with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	But if she does not go out with all that we have described, then be careful not to tire yourself out by insisting on her during the process of extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	But it is necessary that when she goes out from the os of the uterus, there are some ligaments attached to the woman's loins.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then sterilize her with a four-fold ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For this reason it will decay her after a few days, and dissolve, and go out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	But when it decays, an evil smell rises from it to the stomach and head, and injures that one with sickness.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	But it is necessary so that suitable suffumigations be administered to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancient ones have already experienced suffumigation with mustard and dried fig.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	Form a tool for suffumigating the woman during the retention of the Secundina and during the periods.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let the skin be similar to that of a fowl or a goat; and let the edge be placed wide upon the fire; and let the smoke be placed above plums; hold it, until that smoke is consumed; and let another be held.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	On the Treatment of an Unbroken Anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Head LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born with their anuses intact, and these have been affected by the subtle sirocco of Syphus.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, the midwife should pierce that sirocco with her finger; and if she is not able to do so, let her pierce it herself with a sharp Spatulim; and let her take care not to touch the serpent.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then put thereon wool wet in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then heal that wound with ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you suspect that it is being affected by the wine and oil, then put a lead pipe in the hole for many days, and let it be removed when the boy wishes to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And sometimes the anus is affected by wine or oil from congestion of the wound or pus.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore let that consolidation be removed, and then heal it with the above-mentioned things, as I have said in the treatment of an absent anus with lead pipe and oil.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	On the Treatment of Fistulas Which Occur in the Lower Parts.
Caput LXXX.	Head LXXX.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	A fistula which occurs in the lower parts are a protuberance and grossness near the anus: or in the space of one part: and is a single fistula, or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	Therefore when that protuberance is old, it opens, and from it runs a watery white discharge, or subtle pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And when some of these fistulas are penetrating.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore the penetrating ones are known by that which issues from defecation and windiness, when a person with diarrhea uses it; and perhaps it issues from them without wind.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And some of these fistulas are, when they penetrate into the space up to the skin, and up to the edge of the pubic bone.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are penetrating from them up to the joint of the hip, and up to the node of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	But from that which is recognized The penetrating fistula up to the anus, and also from the non-penetrating one, that is, when you insert your index finger into the anus: and insert a thin tentulum in the fistula out of iron or brass: when there is no curvature.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	That if in that there is a curve: then insert into it a thin tentulum or a small piece of wool from the hair of the horse, until you feel the tentulum, or a small arrow in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	That if you do not feel it within, and there proceeds from the opening nothing of discharge, nor is it hot or cold as I have said: then you will know that it is not a penetrating one: therefore turn your attention to cure.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating up to the scrotum, or up to the meatus of the urine: then the meaning of it is the discharge of urine from it, and its prohibition from this so that the place becomes hardened with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	But if it is penetrating up to the joint of the hip, or up to the mouth of the hip: then the sign of it is, that it should reach the tentulum up to there, if there is no curvature up to the mouth: and the finding of pain in the surrounding part, and that it discharges pus from it at all times: and that it does not dry up in it with the medication, nor becomes hardened with unguent.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in these fistulas there is no cure at all: and the cure of them is a labor and vain toil from foolish doctors, over whom is created.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in that which is not penetrating, and is not old, there is hope for a cure with a bandage: for I tell you, and have already proved it: and it is, so that the sick man lies between your hands on his back: and wipe the legs of him up to above his hips, and his hips are bent towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce the lead, or air, if it is in a winding fistula, until you know where the thread goes.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If, however, he feels it weak around a certain part, then it is necessary that you introduce your index finger into the part.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If, however, you feel that the thread has already entered your finger without touching it, and between your finger and the skin: then you know for certain that it is penetrating: so don't worry about it, because it is not a cure of his, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They said, however, that he heals in some people by meat, and from the treatment of which he hopes to be cured, i.e., as it happened before, introduce the brand new fire into the fistula according to its length, and introduce the same fire into the fistula until it reaches a certain part.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that again twice or three times until you know that all the added and filtered meat is like a feather of an owl's wing.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then the cure of that with a liniment of oil, until those meats come out, which have been burned: and then the cure of that with an ointment which generates meat and consolidates it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If he heals, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then he does not heal with any other cure ever.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the thread comes out, and does not come to your finger, which is in the anus, and is between the thread and a certain skin: and you see the fistula in that part which follows the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you will see that it dries up what is in the fistula, until it is dried where the end of the thread is, and the thread is released and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean those filtered meats which are like feather of an owl' wings so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If, however, he overcomes you with blood, and dissolves between you and the operation - let those meats go: then it is better that it happens, and a faster cure, cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medication.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For cautery is of good habits when it gathers with fire, and gives heat to the flesh, and cuts off blood, and dries up moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then that care with liniments of the butter in oil, or with rags torn, until the place expels pus, and the flesh dried up goes out.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then that care when the wound with consolidated ointments, producing hard flesh: and are the medicines in which are staphylitis and drying out.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they are healing, then already are cured: and do not make an iteration.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the Fistula has come to deep place of the anus, and is elongated from the superfluity of the body: then introduce your finger into the anus, and ask him.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	But if you feel trying, and between you, and among him is a weapon of the sharp one, or flesh, and is near penetration: then is not the operation in that, unless after a second time trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is, for it is administered in him one of two ways: or as it cauterizes itself, as we said: or as it severs away, until the consequence of its concavity, so that it becomes possible to you to introduce a liniment, and from near.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the section, that you do not fall upon a contending part of an anus, and happens on the ill-timed end of the excretion without will. But do it with care, lest you should hurt some part of the body: and make a cut to see whether it is able to bear the cutting.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then that care with him which we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps is healed: or prolongs him the wound, and cleanses it after he has dried up it until near of an anus, as we have said, or with a trying, or with another acuter instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those flesh that are filthy in the section, until where you can with the examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then try a restoration of all the wounds with the section, and a hole that consolidates above: and remains a Fistula open in the interior part of an anus, and is lighter over the ill-timed.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes a fistula is followed in this way: and that is when you push a probe into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and margin of the anus; then take hold of the extreme end of the punctured one, which is like a needle, that is, the corium, in this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And push into it a thread of thread with five threads, and around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then push a probe with a thread into the fistula, until you get a congealed mass.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If then it is penetrating into the inner margin of the anus near, then take out the thread from that hole: so that you push your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together at once: and tighten them well, until those flesh that are between the two ends of the thread fall off, and then care for the wound, until it heals over, and is well.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If, however, the opening of the fistula does not penetrate: then make it penetrate in any way you can, unless it is in a deep place.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it is not good for you, that you should make it because of the snake, and do not hit yourself.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it is well.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The form of the spike which is found in the fistula, whose sharpness is sharp enough, and one side is not sharp, so that it does not hit that which is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Regarding the suture of hemorrhoids, from which runs blood from their incision: and care for the sores.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter LIII.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or, indeed, they are inside the anus, like carbon charcoal, or plums: or almost like grain.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And some of them are small, and some are large: and blood runs from them always, and is one, and they are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside of the body, and at the extremities thereof.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	Indeed those which are outside of the body, are for the most part few in quantity of humidity, from which runs yellow water, or a little blood by steady course: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the cure which is within the body, is, as you prescribe to the sick person that he should strain himself: and it is to be expressed, until it comes out of the anus, and appears to you as a kind of wax.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore therefore hang them with a hook: or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them where they grow in their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If they do not hold themselves with hooks, because of their humidity and their own softness: then grasp them with a sharp cloth, or with a twine made of a double-twined thread, and draw them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and sprinkle over them after the incision some warm powders, that they may stand in their place of cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what has gone before in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then cure them with the remaining cure, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	That if the anus does not yield to coming out, then use enemas on the sick person, in which there is a small mordency, that it may moisten with him who is in the anus, and obeisce to coming out quickly, when it comes out with the sick person.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If however the warts are taken out from the anus, then their condition is lighter, easier: and it is that you take them with your nail, or that you take them with a hook, and cut them off.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then cure them with the above-mentioned method until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And who repels the cutting with iron, then it is necessary that you administer a suture to them according to this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a thread covered with wax, and insert it into the wound.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw the warts towards the top, and make the thread penetrate with a needle into the root on the other side: and turn the two ends of the thread round, in the lower part of the needle, and let them cross each other: and tighten the warts with a strong twist.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then take the thread and remove it from outside.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Then place a bandage on all of them except one; and do not tie your own, so that it will run free from any excess blood.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place a cloth soaked in rosewater or milk on top of it and place the wound thereon; and instruct the sick person to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then remove the bandage when he has fallen asleep.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore the wounds have fallen off, take care of them with ointment and with the rest of the cure, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	The Care of Fractures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For often accidents happen from dried up faeces and natural constriction.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When therefore they are a little dry and there is no medicine to them; then it should be rubbed with the dung of swallows or with your own finger, until they are moistened, and the upper skin which prevents them from healing taken off.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then take care of them, until they are healed as much as is necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If however they do not heal; then rub them again with a more vigorous rub than before, until they bleed profusely, and then take care of them until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	The Cure of Scurvy, whether in sailors or not; and of sore throats, and of flies.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter LIII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You should know that scurvy is a small round knot like the color of the body, similar to a clăuus on the head; and it appears throughout the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes; and causes pain when walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Then it should be cut off what is at the root of the claw-like shape, and held with pliers or a pin, and rooted out from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then take care of that; and if you have a caustic, treat it as it is described in your own chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	But of the sore one there is only a small eminence, rough, filthy, round, rising from the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And many times accidents happen to the hands of boys.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And the treatment for this is that you stretch the tendon, and hit it with your fist: or you tie it with silk thread: or you pull it with a hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if it is a vein, you cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medicine: and these veins that are turned in, and not turned in with an instrument that I call a 'tool', are eradicated.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	But a bug that is also a small eminentia that is filtered, thick, on the surface of the body, waddling into the depth deeply: and when it comes to be cold, it feels in it a similar stinging of a bug, and becomes all over the body: and much of it is made in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And the treatment for this is that you take a tube from a goose feather, or a strong quail's feather: and you put the tube on the bug, until it holds a circle of the tube on its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then you roll your hand with the tube, until you separate what is in the circumferent of the bug: and you put it in the depth of the flesh, and you eradicate the bug from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if the vein, make this with a tube of air, or iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the tube be placed on the surface of the vein at a sublimital point, drawing a dull noise that облегчает the appreciation of the finger and its revolution.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you want to cauterize the bug according to what was said above, in the cauterizing of Athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	§ On the forms of instruments that are used to administer poultices in illnesses of the hen, and for the solution of the eye, and for the colon.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	When the poultice is made of silver, or of gold-plating, or of brass, or of hammered brass.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And when it is made of these small instruments, and of great ones, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	And thus that which is given to the care of boys' lungs, let it be thin; and of those who are weak or painful, let their steam be as well.
Clistere magnum.	And thus the large enema.
Cistere paruum.	And thus the small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	Make the canna, that is, the upper part in which it is tied uter, wide according to this manner: and let there be a distinction so that it is tied as you see, and the lower extremity which enters into an anum, be dull, that is, not open, soft, greatly, drawing towards subtility: and on one side of it there are two holes, and on the other side a hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And let the width of the hole be according to the thickness of the rays, and the thicker the smaller, and let uter in which are placed medicines from animal matter: or from paper piece, which is according to the form of a small aspirator: whose root is a palm one.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And let many holes be pierced through as it revolves, and let the space which is between each hole be the width of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then introduce into those holes a strong thread from raw silk, which is from ten threads, or about them, and bind it with the uter like an aspirator.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	And when this uter has been put into it, let it be pulled up in the canna between two distinctions with strong constriction.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then let the enema be made with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the shape of the uter here depicted, and of the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of making enemas with it is this: that you fill the uter or the uesica with medicine which has been heated according to the tolerance of the nurse: and let it not be hot greatly, or cold greatly.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then let the sick person lie on his back, and raise his legs upward: and place below him a thump, that is, a mattress over which men lie, or a blanket.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then dip the extremity of the enema in oil, or in albus ovilis, or in mucilaginous foenugraeum, or similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce yourself into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the assistant take hold of him with both hands and express it out with a strong thrust until all that is in the clitoris has come out into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the clitoris and lift up his weak legs against the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine makes him want to defecate, then hold on as long as you can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps all night with it, it is more difficult to treat.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if you clean him out with a solution of the urinary tract and push forward his defecation: then repeat the clisterization until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or painful pustules in the anus, then sit in a mild bath, lube up gently, and express the clitoris with the fingers of the hand, letting it out slowly.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of a soft clister that sits on top of which there is a tight skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	The treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter LXXXII
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already said in the division of the treatment of wounds which belonged to the book, and I say here the cure of these with the hand, and with the second aid.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say, then, that wounds differ according to that by which they are made, and according to the place on which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Thus, the wounds that are often made, are like the impact of stones: or a cut of a knife, or a blow with a lance, or a piece of wood, or an arrow: and similar things from many other things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	But wounds that are made according to the places of the body are, such as a wound that falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the hip: and similar ones from the limbs.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling about the cure of certain wounds, that I may put forward the reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I shall begin with simple wounds of the head; because the memory of the compositors will come at the beginning of chapter three.
Dico ergo.	I say this.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When it happens in the head, a simple wound, and there is no fracture of bone: consider then, if it is from a rock-throw, or similar, and has already broken the skin only a little: and it is a great wound, and fear for the consequences of gangrene of the heat: then approach, and perform cephalic phlebotomy immediately: and do not delay that: and draw out from it according to the quantity of its virtue: if there is nothing prohibitive against phlebotomy, especially if the blood which flows from the wound is few.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick one beware of over-indulgence in wine and rich food.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	But if anything prohibes moderation, then he should retreat from meat, and approach not to wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place over the wound if it happens that there is a hot aposteme, infused oil in rose water alone, or with wine in which there is stliction.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	But if you are secure from a hot aposteme, then place over the wound if it is recent with its own blood, and has not changed its air, the powder which I shall describe later: and if it has already changed its air, then place over it some ointment, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	But if the wound is large, or from an incision of a knife, and similar: and if its edges do not come together by means of powder, then join them together with sutures, according to what I shall describe later concerning the suturing of wounds of the legs.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	But if the wound has already touched bone, and hangs, and there is no retention of it, unless in a small suspension: then incision.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then care for the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh at a place of skin, and command the sick person to eat food in which there is coarseness, such as are heads of meat, and cooked wheat, until it is like a pulse: and that also.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If pus has set in and there is no attachment of the bone: then incise the whole putrefied part and throw it away: then take care of that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	But if there is an artery in these wounds or a vein from which blood flows: and it is not cut by medicines, then inquire about the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you have sewed her up without cutting her, then dry her with Spumil, or tie her up.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	That if necessity compels you to do this which I have said, then cauterize it, until blood is cut off.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	But if these wounds are small and simple, then the matter of them is easy, light: so that you put dust on them: for they become hardened before they change.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The way of the powder for burnings.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take a part of olive oil, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of burnt limestone: mix them all up well, and sift them: and fill them with powder, and bind them with good binding, until they adhere to the wound well, and are congealed with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then tie it up well from above with powder, and let it go, and do not take it off until it has healed, so that it does not open.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine will not drive it out until it is cured.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And when it has done this by itself, for you do not have olive oil or dragon' blood, the same operation is made in many large wounds, when they are put on and bound, and their own blood which does not change the air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	That if it has been somewhat altered by the air, especially when it is in summer time, then this powder's intention is not in position: so take care of it with that which I have said, so that you put on it some digestible ointment: or put on it a dust made from barley flour, made with water and honey, until pus is discharged.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of those left over with cure, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If it should happen that there is a fracture of the bone and it is small, then extract it with the Gestra: and I will already say that I am treating the fractures of the head, because what follows is about to come.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	§ On injuries of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Head LVII.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If an injury has occurred in the neck, then there is no difference in its treatment if it is on one side or the other, and there is also no difference in treating a single injury of the head.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	But if an incision has already been made on the nerve of the neck or an artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in its treatment unless it is used to produce a stinging sensation, like pepper, and bleeding, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	For nerves are harmful, and hurt them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put anything cold on a wound at all: for the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuance is with the brain, which is a superior member: and let whatever is used in treatment be of the nature of lye, like lye mixed with sweet water sometimes infused with oil, or with rosewater oil, and turpentine, when it is rinsed also with sweet water: and also mineral stones, according to this method, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	But if the wound is large, then administer a stitch: or cover its edges with powder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	But if the injury is deep, or has occurred in a hollow on the lower part of it where pus has already gathered, then pierce it in a depressed place there.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If it should happen that an incision has been made on the nerve of an artery and the blood flow is followed: then separate it, or dry it, and tie it: or burn it if necessity demands to do so.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	But if the injury has been made by a spine of the guitar, or by all of it, and the skin seems to be sound: then join the skin with a stitch over the neck of the guitar, and do not touch the guitar, but make the wound even, and bring it back into its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tighten him with a ligature and let go for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with ointment until it heals over.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	But if the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then probe it: if there are any bone fragments in it, take them all out, or what you can: and if it is not ready (to heal), let it go until the bone rotten, and its exit is freed.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the bone is fresh, then powder it with a powder that you knead into it.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	But if it goes into the nerve and becomes a fistula: then care for it with what is written in his own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	De the surgery of the ulnar nerve.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter LXXXVI.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is an impression from a lance or a knife: and the wounds are deep, then examine it carefully.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	But if from the ulnar a pus comes out, and when it drains from it the patient is weak, then you should know that the bone is deadly.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep and is fresh with its own blood: then do not put powder in it from the first hour, nor tighten it so that the blood does not stay in its depth, and run back to the heart, and cause weakness: but put an attractable ointment in it, and loosen it by day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	But if the ointment is not present with you, then put a clean rag on the wound to soak up what comes out of it from the moisture: and let the patient sleep on the bone so that it runs what is collected in it.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	But if the wound has passed the three days or more, and there is no spasm of the limbs, nor a bad tremor of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and its other symptoms are good: then you should know that the bone is healthy.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ease, and with the rest of the cure, until it heals over.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If indeed the healing of it is excused, and it has been opened always, then you shall know that it has already become a Fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	The cure of that itself from its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if there is a scar from an incision with a knife, or it is simple on the surface of the chest, or on the back; then the cure of that itself with what preceded from stitchery, if it is large: or with dust, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if it has already made an impression on the bone, and has cut it out from there with a splinter: then inquire about the fracture, and approach to remove that splinter, if it is separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	But if they are not separated, then dismiss them, until the bone rotten, for the extraction of them is eased.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	But as regards the remaining wounds and accidents in the remaining limbs, the judgment in their cure is the judgment which I have mentioned.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Regarding the wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestine, and the emergence of them.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption which happens in the belly is great, medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	So from a great disruption, and when the intestine has come out, or the number of intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Why does that happen, and what is the stitchery of them more vigorous and difficult?
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small disruption also becomes difficult from another mode.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	This follows, that the reduction of them is more difficult if you do not approach to their entry into their place directly: for when it swells up, it opens, and increases: why does the entry of it become difficult?
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore this follows, that a medium disruption is the best: for when it is not difficult to reduce the intestine, as it is difficult in these two species.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the stitchery of the belly is according to four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common stitches meet in a stitch of the belly, and in a stitch of the remaining wounds of the body: and two other stitches properly communicate with the remaining wounds of the body.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	Indeed, they are more proper with the stitch of the wrist; and I tell you one way or another with explanation and demonstration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say then, for when the wrist is small and has come away a little from the body, and there is something of the intestine out of it, and it is difficult to reduce it; then it is on account of two or three things.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or because the wound is small, as we have said: Or because there is swelling in the intestine from cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When then is it so? Then you should warm the wound, so that you dip a sponge or a wet cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or you should put it in squill water and hyssop and pepper and stir it with the intestine, until the swelling goes down.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When then does this liquid make the wrist better; and it is better than water alone in resolving inflammation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When you see the swelling has already resolved, then moisten the intestine with the astringent water in which it was steeped, or make it stronger.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For by that means the entrance into it is eased when it is small.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	But if the return of the joint after this cure is slow, then find a little cut with the instrument with which they tear the hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when it is prepared, whether it be cutting or not; and there is no constraint to do it after necessity and want of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be sharp and the other not, and the end a little less acute than the middle; and let it be somewhat like the saw, as you see it.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When then is it prolonged and the intestine goes into it; then let there be a return of it to its own place according to its nature, if possible to that; for it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	But when then is the wound wide at the lower part of the wrist; then you should lay him on his back and raise his legs.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the superior part of the uterus, then put its head and let its chest be higher than its inferior.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And likewise if the disruption is in one of two parts of the uterus, then put your intention and always keep this in mind so that the part where the wound is located is higher than the other.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it should be, so that you will prepare those who are wounded in large wounds and in medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But in small wounds, put it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make sure that the faithful minister who holds the entire disruption in his hand is present between your hands: and bring its lips together.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then have someone who follows the thread piece by piece: and this is the common way of sewing one piece.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is as you take it, or count it according to the quantity of the width of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then release from the end of the disruption by a finger's length, that is to say, grasp: and fix now one beyond which you introduce the thread in two ends of the skin, with two ends of sifac that are under the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have already brought together two ends of the skin, and two ends of sifac: and there are four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tighten with double thread around the accus a few times from both sides at the same time, until the two lips of the wound are brought together by the decreasing aggregation.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then release the bulk with your finger too, and fix in it now another one: then make it straight with the thread, as you did with the first one.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	So therefore do not cease to do this with him while you are holding on to the accus until you have completed the whole constriction of the wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And there are accus media between the bulk and the subtility: for the accus subtile very quickly incised the flesh: and the grosses are difficult to enter into the skin: therefore it is necessary that they be of medium subtility and bulkiness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not appropriate that the needle should be inserted into both ends of the skin which is close: so that the flesh does not quickly be wounded, and the wound does not open before its consolidation, and also does not be stretched with the suture, so that the wound does not be prevented from consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the end of the needle so that it does not hurt the patient when he sleeps: and put feathers from cloth on both sides, which hold the ends of the needle: and let them go until you know that the wound has been consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this kind of stitch with needles is much more convenient for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Since it suffices in the stitching of them with one, or two, or around them.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	But the second common stitch is, so that you add the four ends: the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of the thread in one line, with a needle in which the filament is equal in thinness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you pierce with the needle the four ends, draw it back from the part from which you began, so that the thread hangs from the upper part of the wound: so that there is a stitch, as when clothes are sewn together, and put between every stitch the thickness of the little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This kind of stitch is known to men.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this kind of stitch I sewed my own wound, which had happened to a man in his abdomen, who was wounded with a knife, and there was a break in the skin of a hand's width: and there came out from within about two hands' length from the mid-gut, and there was a break in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	Then I reduced it after he had stood still for twenty-two hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	So the wound was consolidated in the space which had been for about 15 days: and I nursed him, and he recovered: and he lived many years, restored to his own health.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians judged that he would not recover.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it came to pass through a miracle that I did not heal him with the ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	For I was in a place where the ointment was not found, and there was none of the medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I then put on the wound a wet cloth twice a day, and I kept washing it with honey water until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	Two kinds of sutures I will name according to the report of the teaching.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, as you begin with the sharp suture: and you insert it from the outside toward the inside part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle enters into the skin, and goes down into a fold according to the length and breadth of all the body: let go of the end of the sutures that you have inserted from outside, and make it penetrate into the other end from inside toward outside in the other extreme.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this in the same extreme end that goes from outside toward inside: and let go of the end of the sutures that you have inserted from outside, and make it penetrate into the other end from inside toward outside in the other extreme. When you have made it penetrate like this at the same extreme end that goes from outside toward inside, and let go of the end of the sutures that you have inserted from outside, and make it penetrate into the other end from inside toward outside: and make it penetrate with your penetration when you make it penetrate in the end that goes from inside toward outside, and make it penetrate with your penetration until it has penetrated all of it.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then also from this same later side, and with the other end that is from outside, and pull out of the skin where it has penetrated: and let go of the end of the sutures that you have pulled out from the skin.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then also reduce it in that skin, and with the other end that is from outside, and join together this end of the skin that you have pulled out: and make that end of the sutures that you have joined come together with the skin; and make that one end move, and the other stay still until they are all connected according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the top of this suture is as you join the skin together: so that its end that comes from one side goes with the skin; and so that you let go of its other end go on the other side until it is completed.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	Second kind of suture, which he called his own, as said Galen.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This speech was related as follows, that they sutured it in the second way, similar to which some physicians do so that they collect all parts according to nature: and they apply one end of the suture to one end of it, and the other end of the suture to the other end.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this is what I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you fasten this at the end of Mirach close to you from the external side, and cause it to penetrate into the internal part alone: and you dismiss the two ends of the suture.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then reverse the knot, and cause it to penetrate from the external side to the internal part in the two ends of the suture, that is to say, on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then reverse both, and also cause them to penetrate from the inside to the outside in the two ends of the suture, that is to say, on both sides: and you reverse both ends of the suture towards the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this mode of suturing is better than the common easy one, and it is a suture whose predecessor's remembrance precedes it.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore the speech of Galen as well.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And said some:
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the hand with two finger bones.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, so that you put one thread in both bones: and begin with the insertion of the bone, from where it is with you, and cause it to penetrate as far as the other side, following the suture of those who are equal by nature.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you should know that when the fracture is in the middle of the hand: then the suture of it is more difficult than that of the other places of the hand.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	However, the judgment of surgery of wounds is a judgment of the other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, because when you have obtained a wound fresh with its blood, before it rusts itself: and reduce the bowels, and their own flesh, and fit the flesh: then put it on the powder of incisions.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If a wound has been affected by air: then put on the body some ointment, which are present with you, until it makes pus; and let the strands fall, and the sifacs become firm, and the mirach.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that one as is the treatment for other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if you do not have with you the medicines, then put on it at once, so that it begins to emit pus, and change it with new one: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medication for various wounds, but when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	But if you are in a time, when a wound communicates with a main member in the injury, then it is necessary that you should dip wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rosewater oil: and put on it around places which are between the hips, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	That if it feels pain, or punctures, or corruption in his intestines (for this often happens), then take a clister with wine, black, hot: especially if putridity has already set in the intestines, and a penetrating issue has reached the peritonium.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And you should know that what is from the large intestine is easier to heal: and that which is from the small one, is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	But the intestine which is called Jejunum, does not accept healing from a wound that has happened in it at all: and it is because of its multitude, being from wounds, and size of them, and because of the softness of its body, and closeness of its nerves' nature.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	But if the wound that proceeds from an injury is sharp, and you gain it gradually: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if it has passed away from it a space, and it has already been made bright, or dark: then you should tighten it with a thread above the place which is darkened from it, so that blood does not flow out.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	For this reason, the tendons and arteries are in the zone. Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place two ends of thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside itself: so that it is lifted away from you by its attraction, and extracted from the zone of the wound, and the pus of the wound is released.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remember the wound that happened in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When the injury occurred in the intestine, and it was small: then it is possible for some people to be restored: indeed, I saw one who was injured in his abdomen with a lance thrust, and there was an arrow in his stomach, and the arrowhead was old: and a fistula was made, and fluid came out of it, and windiness.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	Then I applied the cure, until I was not confident in his recovery: and I did not hesitate to examine him, until he was healed, and the site was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place now consolidated, I feared for the sick, that a bad accident would happen to him in his abdomen: and it did not happen to him from that bad accident.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better health, eating and drinking, enjoying sex, and entering a bath, and exercising in his exercises.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some experimenters said, because when it happened in the intestine an arrow, and it was small: then it should be tied according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, so that you get big ant heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then gather the two lips of the wound, and place one ant with an open mouth on the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	So when he holds it over it, and tightens his mouth, cut off its head, because it clings to it, and does not let go.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place one ant next to the first, and do not stop doing that with the ant after the second quantity of wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce the injury, and apply the arrow.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For these reasons, the remaining heads attached to the intestine are removed until the intestine is empty and cured, and it does not harm the sick person.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible that the intestine be tied as well with a thin thread: which having been removed from the animal's intestine, is attached to it after it has been introduced into the lump.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is, that you take the end of this thread out of the intestine, and much of the flesh be removed.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie this thread's end at the edge, with a thin thread wrapped around it.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then introduce this thread into the lump, and along with it the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce the mass to a rupture.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of sewing with a needle and thread is no more than a second opinion and a matter of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know that the hole is great and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines: then it is not a simple matter, nor is its cure complete.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Regarding the care for Zuchamen and Fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter LXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know that every wound, or old ulcer when it has healed over and become a scar, and does not heal properly, and always discharges pus, and does not close: then it is called universally a fistula wherever it may be in the body, and we call it a Zuchamen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula is, according to its nature, a filtered, hard, white nodule: which has no pain, but a wrinkled skin; and because of it, some call it Risati, that is, a tail.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in certain hours moist, emitting pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps it splits the moisture in certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And when this moisture is much, and little: and thick, and thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already preceded in the division, then when I said wounds, that every wound which does not heal, and does not form flesh within it, is not anything except because of a new cause.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	One is because of the scarcity of blood in the body, or because of its malice, or because there is hard flesh between it and over its lips, which prevents the birth of flesh, or because it is full of noise and filth, or because the wound in itself is putrid and the matter that is emitted from it is of bad quality, or because the medicine is incompatible with its cure, or because corruption falling in the region is a kind of plague, or through the nature of the region, as happened in Caesar Augustus, where the digestion of ailments is difficult and healing of abscesses by nature is delayed, or because it has only one jaw, or because its number of bones is small.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown you all the causes and signs of these, and their treatments with medicines divided up: and it is necessary here that I should tell you about the treatment of the fistula and the zucca, which is done by a surgical operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	So you know that the fistula happens in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For from them are the fistulas that reach the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or the intestines, or urinary bladder, or any of the ribs, or any of the spine vertebrae, or any of the joints of the body by composition: like the hands and feet: and from them are those that reach the vicinity of the main member, and its alike.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Which, then, of these fistulas is of the nature that it is difficult to cure, and does not respond to treatment, and is a source of trouble and ignorance: for example, those that come from the ears, or the eyes.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If it is from a fistula whose depth does not reach these places that I have mentioned: and you hope and trust in its cure, and seek to understand it, then take some trypsin or iron, if the fistula tends towards straightness, and examine it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	But if in the fistula there is a curve, then investigate it with a thin plumb.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	For because of its soothing nature, lead is beneficial for the relief of pain and for healing wounds and sore spots.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If the fistula has multiple openings, it is not possible for you to indicate it with a probe when attempting.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, let the clister be used from its own opening and not from another opening.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For because of the moisture that comes out with the clister, it passes through other openings and runs out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then inquire after the manner in which it is possible for you to recognize that there is an opening, a nerve, and that the fistula is distant or near: or that there is one fistula whose openings are many, and that it lies over all of it with great strength of your hand; when you question it, as you ask about a sick person, and by the discovery of pain at compression with your hand on the place, and similar indications and causes of accident.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then, when you stand still with true station, then probe towards cure according to confidence: and is it, that you consider then, if there is a fistula that appears near, or in a place of salutary distance from the joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places that I have told you about: then dry up the fistula according to what has been stated before, and take away whatever is in it from filtration, and corrupted flesh that arises in its opening out of flesh, or blood, and similar things: and cure it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If, however, the fistula is of a deep depth and is in a straight line: then it should be separated from it as much as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it from all of its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer lead melted in acute medicines: and insert it into the fistula that you have held with a wire: do this often, until the acid medicine corrodes all of what remains in the fistula's concavity from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with an ointment that generates healthy flesh, until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If indeed it is not healed by that [remedy], then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If indeed the cause is a fistula and it is certified in your presence [that]: then examine that person, and dry that person according to what I have told you: if it does not stop him from anything of new birth, or nerve, or main member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If indeed you find an opening, and there is some corrosion therein, and it is black: then scrape it, until that corruption is completely removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for that person with what makes the flesh grow on that person, until that person is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	That if it does not heal, and it spews out pus as it did before: then you should know that you have not completely eradicated the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	So examine it again [by applying] a second time, and carefully feel its pulse, and clean it with your last bit of strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore that person.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If indeed it is healed, it is good: and if not, then you should know that that corruption is in the depths of the body, which you have not achieved.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	So it is not within your power to heal it, unless you let nature take its course with it.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	That if the corruption is in the small opening of the throat, and it is possible for you, attract that person with subtle hooks which are suitable for that person.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	That if there are many bones, then carefully feel all of them, and do not let go of any of them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If indeed it gives you a contrary feeling from any moisture, and there is no fear or mistake in cutting them: then cut those moistures and the flesh, if there is any, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If indeed you are not prepared to remove the bones from your own time, then place on a rotisserie what will decay that person: and let go of that person, until it decays what is around those bones from flesh and moisture.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And keep the fracture in place so that it doesn't heal improperly.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And tighten the incision as much as you can manage in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	With a hammer and chisel, if possible, cut the bone as much as you can manage in your operation. If not, use sulfur treed with oil: or soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some other ointment made of gold.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those particular humors rot and the bones separate from them, it is a relief to remove them, and their attraction to each other.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	But if it is a large bone, such as the femur or ilium, and that which is rotten is a part of it, then saw off the last piece until the blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the bone.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	But if what is rotten in it is a large part, and the corruption has reached the bone marrow, then you must cut off the bone, and incise all of it up to the place where the corruption ends: then take care of the bone, until it heals properly.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I will tell you about the surgery that happened to a man on his thigh, so that it may be an example and help for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	He was a young man of about thirty years of age, to whom there occurred a pain in his thigh, because something moved within him, that is, from the inside, until it reached the leg, and there appeared a great swelling; and he had no external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	So, when his time came with the error of the doctors, until the swelling was opened, and many materials entered with him.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was delayed until his leg was wrapped up, and many openings were made in him: all of which discharged pus, and the body's humors.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	So he had treatment by a multitude of doctors for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of hands, until I was called in, and I saw his leg, and the materials that were flowing out of its openings at a great rate: also, all of his body was covered with a yellow color, and his skin had become very thin.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	I therefore attempted to enter one of the openings of the mouth, and the attempt reached the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings thoroughly: and I found them to reach up to themselves on each side from all parts of the thigh.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	Then I turned away, and followed along one of the openings, until I detected a part of the bone: and I found it to be corrupt: which was already corrupt, and deteriorated, and putrid, and pierced, as far as it penetrated into the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	Then I sharpened what had been detected by me, and made it ready from corrupt bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I took away what was not in the bone except that corruption, which I cut off and sharpened.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I placed the repair of the wound with long-drying medicines.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I attempted again, and detected on the bone above the first detection: and I found a continuous corruption with the bone, and sharpened what seemed right to me from that corruption as well.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried to repair it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Then I detected on the same thing again, and did not cease to pierce the bone in detail, and tried to repair it: and it was not repaired until I pierced from the bone a little palm, and took that out with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I repaired it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated, and healed: and this iteration in the operation of it, and its cutting, would not have been necessary except for the weakness of the nurse, and her lack of tolerance, and my fear over it from death: because it happened to him at all times from the bad syncope of discharge.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was therefore healed with a whole healing: and flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good disposition came to his body, and his strength returned: and he recovered in his dispositions: and he did not feel any opposition when walking at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	But if the jaw is突出 and already broken: then one should bind it up, in this way: that you take a ligament, and tie it firmly at the end of the prominent bone: and instruct someone who will hold it upwards: and put another ligament, from a thicker wool, on the first ligature.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind the flesh up over the bone which is on either side of the jaw: and extend its end so that you can pull the flesh downward: and you shall cover the flesh over the place which you wish to bind, so as not to cut the flesh with the saw.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a board or board below the bone on either side: for when you do this, it is not forbidden to cut the corrupt flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it should be that the binding is a little over the corrupted place, so as not to appear on the appearance of the bone; and does not appeal to its own force, but forces itself with the force of another binding.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted and not prominent, then a portion of it remains with another part: corruption is in its middle or in some part of it; then you shall cover all the flesh from every part.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place the board below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then bind that first part from which the corruption proceeds, until it continues to be bound on the other side; and let the binding be of about the same length from corruption as we said above.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is in the joint, then cut that joint which is corrupted, and bind the bone where it continues on the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	But if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is nothing of genius in that; there is only an injury.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is in the hand or foot shaft: then the matter is very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But you should inquire how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And cut it and clean it up according to whatever arrangement you can make, and with whatever genius it rectifies itself to you: when it does not do you any harm by cutting the vein or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And you shall know that the incisor and serrated saws are many for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and subtlety and magnitude and perfection and hardness and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, it is necessary that you prepare an instrument suitable for each kind of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And you shall know, these operations require a long study on the instrument with which you work.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of these ways will be a testimony to your understanding of the manner of sickness; for then you will already have found through yourself that which suits him from among the instruments for every illness.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am confirming to you, at the end of this chapter, the number of instruments which you place as examples on which you operate, and which you have tried out on other patients.
Forma Serrae.	The form of the saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of a third saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of a fourth saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This drawing of the form of the saw, as it has been made somewhat off-center.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let the curve of its upper part be made of iron; and the handle, of boxwood; and let it be made with a slightly off-center pyramid.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The form of the razors joined together.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be shaped like a star-shaped clavulus; and its points be shaped like the points of an אלישטפיגי (elishtefigi).
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it does not fit, unless it rubs with the head of joined razors when it is worn; for it has a large and broad lip.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The form of the larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The form of the middle-sized razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The form of the wide razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The form of the razor in which is a concave curve.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The form of another thin razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The form of the razor with its curved extreme end.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The form of a small, thin razor for the tip of the finger.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The form of the razor used for cutting bones.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Form also rasors great.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a chisel and its edge is like a saw: it is displayed in many places from the chiseling of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	Form of the chisel which is suitable for its chiseling that which is pierced out from the bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its edge is triangular, its extremes are acute.
Fit ex Indi.	Fit from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And likewise it is necessary that all which we have said of the chisel, and of the chisel, and of the saw.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Of incisions extremes, and sawing bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Head LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremes putrefy, or for an extrinsic cause, or an intrinsic one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore the patient was cured by the cure of medicines, and does not confer the cure: and you see corruption to affect a member, which does not recur any injury: then it is necessary that you should cut off that part where the consequences of corruption, so the sick one may be taken away from death, or from the malice which is greater defect of member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign which has happened to that is, that the member is disgraced, until it is cured: that fire has burned it itself, or has putrefied after its color: until that corruption has affected that part, which follows that member, and creeps into all the body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, with incisions, and likewise if the cause of corruption is from percussion of some venenosos: such as scorpioni sea, and vipers, and weasels, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore corruption, or percussion is in the extreme of a finger, then cut off the finger, and not leave any space for corruption, so that it may affect to the remaining hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And likewise if has happened in the hand, then cut off it from the root of a chisel, and not leave any space for corruption, until it takes up to the chisel of the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it has penetrated into it, then cut off the forearm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if corruption has passed over it, and you see that it is swollen around the hip: then in that is death by the nurse.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer apart from that cure, is the quantity of virtue.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And likewise do with the foot, when corruption appears in the toe, then cut it at the root of a knot: and if it enters into the shin, then cut the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	But if it ascends up to the knee, then cut the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	That which if corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no art in it, except cutting off, and leave the sick to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the mode of incising a limb, or of stretching it out, is that you should tie the ligament below, which you would cut: and tie another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And extend one minister of a ligament to the lower: and extend another minister of a ligament upwards to the top.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And thou shalt separate the flesh which is between these two ligaments, with a broad chisel, until thou shalt discover all the bone.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then cut it, or stretch it out.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you should put a cloth of linen between all the parts, and let not the chisel touch the sound place: and cut to the sick with added woe, and let not be cold poultice.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	But if there should happen to flow the blood inward while you work, then cauterize the place quickly: or put on it some powder that binds the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your own medicating, until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a fitting ligament, and take care of it, until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened to the man in his foot, this same thing that I tell you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because it happened to the man in his black foot, when it was scorched like the fire of burning: and that corruption first began in his toe, until it came into the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	The wound was found to be well after he saw the corruption enter into a limb with its movement, which he discovered from pain and its heat; and it struck him at the joint, and was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, that corruption again occurred to him in the same way in the index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	Then he came to me, and I tried to restore that excess with him when I put on his hand from the medicines after purifying his body: and the excess did not recur, and it began to hurt in another finger: until the corruption began to enter into a hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called on me to cut off his hand: and I would not do it, hoping from myself regarding the recurrence of that excess: and I was afraid even for himself regarding the death of his hand at the cutting.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For the strength of the arm was above the loss.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	Afterwards he was disappointed about me, and turned to his own land; and he came back to me on the subject, for he wished it well, and struck off his whole hand; and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not bring this account unless it be an aid to that which falls regarding this kind of disease: and to show what it means, and according as it is applied.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	On the treatment of gangrene, and on the quality of cauterisation with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 80.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When gangrene occurs in some fleshy limb, and space is prolonged for the poultice, until it draws together: then it bursts, or pierces, and that which is in it comes out, leaving a hollow place like a wound: and the skin over it looks like thin cloth: and does not spread to the extreme of corruption, neither does it enter into the mouth, the nose, or the ligaments: it deserves to be called Sinus: but does not bear the name Fistula: however, if it is prolonged in space, until it impresses corruption in some of these limbs, then it is called Fistula, or a bore.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the cure is, that you should strike off that skin all at once like a garment; and especially when it has been thinned and made like a cloth; and trust that it will not adhere to the place on account of its decay.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you expect that the skin will adhere and that that corruption will not follow from it in the end: and if there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, then cure it with myrrh: and this is what you should consider as regard the sinews.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus that issues from it is very foul: then prepare it with the Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and resin, parts in equal quantities, mixed together in a vessel; and let it boil over fire until the medicine turns red: and let it come to be of the consistence of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and prepare it with the myrrh, and string the opening of it, and let the medicine enter into it to the quantity of two hours' duration.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract that medicine with the expression; let it be for several days, until the sinews are clean and the smell is gone.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when you prepare it with water of ash, when this medicine is not present with you: and this is what you should do, that you take the ash of oak or of elm-wood: and pour it on the water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then stir it, and prepare it with the myrrh, until you are certain that the sinews are clean.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient is not tolerant of the Egyptian medicine or water of ash, then prepare it with water and honey, to which has been added a little crushed resin.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or prepare it with honey and wine, because of the property of honey to clean and wash away: and the wine makes the sinews adhere, especially when there is an abundance of styptic and drying in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	How you do that sometimes, and trust that the corruption of the sin has already been removed: then wash him with water with what he does to give birth to flesh in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And is, so you get from an emplastro dyafinicon: and dissolve it with olive oil, and wine tonic: or wash him with some medicines, and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise of ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	That if the orifice of the sinus is tight, in which the cannula of the clister does not enter: then increase it with a little iron: or put in it licorium soaked in ointment Egyptian, or in basilicon ointment, until it increases.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then add the lips with a stitch: and let go from it the amount that is mixed with the clister without adding anything to it.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the orifice from which the pus runs is raised upward: then dry it up in a lower place that is in it, so that the pus runs out of it downwardly: for when the pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being born in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	That if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus completely around its lower part according to what you want: then try, so that you prepare the member with a preparation that runs out of it with ease according to which it is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try, so that nothing of the pus is retained in it at all: and take medicines that are put on a sign, suitable to that which you want.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them out over the cloth of linen.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such a quantity that it communicates with all the sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps on the direct hole of the sinus orifice, a slightly larger hole.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread from the ointment soft on another cloth, according to the quantity of the hole: and put it on him in a distant position from the sinus orifice, so that the exit of pus from it is facilitated: and do not take off the large cloth, until after some days a piece.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	And yet who is above the orifice of the sinus, is he whom you stir at all times, that he may go out what has gathered in him from pus: and know that, for this which runs out of it virus, is much, or little: or digested, or indigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And when you consider this place again of the sinus itself, does the lord feel pain in it, or is there no pain in it? And does he feel a plug in it, or not?
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	So when your medication extends thus far, and you see the material that has come out above the sinus orifice, then know that the sinus is now fastening itself, or approaching the fastening: so then dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wound, then change the cloth to another, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if the virus comes out of the sinus after a long space, do not despair concerning its fastening, for the healing of it approaches, because there are people who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and from them there are who act in the contrary way.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if it comes out after many days of pus that is not digested, then know that the sinus does not fasten itself.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	But if the fastening of the sinus is delayed, and its duration is prolonged: then add to the drying up of medicines, truly let the doctors make them, so that they are in their substance moist, and in their virtue dry: just as the unguent of daphenicon, when added thereto of an excess of addition out of zеги.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the greatest part also, when it is cured, it is, that you take the unguent of daphenicon, and dissolve it with oil of rose, and rub it on the old wound to an equal degree in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then put on the ointment with it, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And this same action does this to you, when the unguent of daphenicon is not present with you, when you heat it up, until it thickens, and you use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Take myrrh and aloe and olive oil; let it be thoroughly mixed with the dust, and spread over honey when it is still warm on fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then wrap a cloth over the wound and tie it tightly around the سین; and cover with honey what you have made to be a poultice, until it has thickened: and apply the dust on the wound, and wrap it again in the cloth, and tie it tightly.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when you have administered to him long-stemmed aristaeus, and the roots of sky-lily, and it is a lily; and grass-root, and daisy.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them simple, or gathered, as they are, and the sifting of themselves: and apply the dust on honey which you have poured out, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	That if the disease of the Sinus is prolonged, and does not heal by this cure: then you shall know that there is corruption in his depths; or it begins to make an impression on bones, or on other hard members of the body, or on ligaments: then you should resort to the cure of Fistulas, as has been aforesaid.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Of the cure of the finger with a panaritis, and of an rubbed nail, and of incision of the finger, added with section.
Caput XCI.	Chapter LXI
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritis is a swelling that arises under the nail of the thumb or of any other finger, and perhaps it may arise in the other fingers also.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When then the disease of this has been prolonged, and the cure of it has been neglected, and has become a sore with a warm moisture; or it is corrupted, and discharges pus, until it corrodes the nail's root: and perhaps it may be corrupted altogether, and perhaps it may reach the mouth, until it has an odour unclean: and makes the end of the finger large, and makes its color dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When then you resort to the cure of it, with that which we have said in the division, and your cure does not bring relief: then you must cut off the whole superfluity that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the nail after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	For if the bone is healthy and the nail also, and the nails too tight to the flesh within, and it begins to hurt: then you should put a small amount of radium under the angle of the nail that hurts the flesh, and press it upwards: and cut the flesh easily, and place on top of what remains of the flesh from burning medicines, rusts until it is completely moved away.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for that with the nail, until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If, however, the corruption has already begun to press on the bone, then you should cut that bone out and remove it: for it never heals while it remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see the corruption and the rust entering into a finger, then cut it at one of its joints, according to what has been said above about its reminder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for that injury, until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If, however, the nail has been worn away or hit: and there is a very painful pain in it, then you should let blood from it first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail with a sharp spatulium across from above to the tip.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And guard it, so that the cut does not go into the flesh below the nail, for you would cause a very painful pain to arise on the sick person, and it would be a cause of the birth of flesh added in place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for that place with the seat that causes pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The finger, however, added which is born in some hands of men, perhaps is fleshy all over: and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it: and the birth of some of its joints or knuckles may be in the joint of the ligature, or in some of the joints of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	So then who is born in some joints of the finger does not move: and who is born at the knuckle of the finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore he who has this fleshly part, the incision into him is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	Which is, that you may incise him at his root with a spatula-shaped blade.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But of him whose birth is in the root of the joint, the cure is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore abstain from incising him.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	But in that one who is born in the digit at the last of the joints, then you should incise him in the first flesh round up to the mouth.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then close the mouth with one of those blades that are convenient for closing it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for him, until he is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	But the consolidation that happens in the digits back to back, often occurs or from the birth of man, namely, he is born with it, or from the consolidation of the wound, or from the burning of fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore it should be that you separate this consolidation, until the digits return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them a twig, or rags soaked in rose oil: so that they do not heal quickly, and separate them: or place between them a thin lead plate, until the site heals as it should.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And likewise if there is consolidation in some digits with the palm, then dry that consolidation, according to which it is prepared and convenient for the shape of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	The Vice of Incision:
Caput XCII.	Head LXXII.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Veins that are swollen and full of melancholic fluid occur in many parts of the body: and many of them come to an end in the legs, especially in the legs of those who move about a lot, and those who carry burdens.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore it should be that you administer a strong discharge of the body from black cholera by some means of exhaling.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then take the patient's blood with a large bowl.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The cure of these veins with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One is, so that they are heated and the black blood is drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	The other way is that you should cut off the vein and take it out entirely.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The dissection is done this way according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First, wrap the leg with hot water until the thick, foul blood dissolves.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then tighten the tourniquet on the leg from the top of the hip to the bottom of the knee while it is bandaged.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then dry off one, two, or three wide sections of the vein.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then cut off, that is to say, extract the blood in your hand from the lower part of the leg up to the top, and from the upper part it should be taken by the phlebotomist before it becomes weak.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then dry off the nail down to the bottom: until you see enough blood come out and how much strength the vein has left.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then tie it up: and tell him to refrain from foods that cause black cholesterol: and repeatedly drain and bleed the vein when they are full, and if it hurts the sick person.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The elevation is done this way according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Rub the leg with a hard object if there are many hairs in it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then put the leg into a bath: or wrap it with hot water in the leg, until it reddens and the veins swell: or exercise it strongly if there is no bath present, until it warms up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry off the skin along the vein in length: or at the end of the leg near the knee, or at the bottom part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with a hook, and scrape off the vein from all parts until you feel it: and at its appearance, you will see it red to black in color.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When you have taken it out of the skin, you will see it white as a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert a hook under it, until it is fully extracted from the skin: hang it with a blind hook, soft.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry off another wide section next to that section with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then peel off the wound from the upper part of the skin, until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then wash it with water as you have done, and hang it with a hook as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry another piece of skin, or more pieces if you are able to do so.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then wash it, and make the cut at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then remove it to the section that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this, until you remove it from the upper section; or with higher sections all around, until when it is completely out: then cut it off.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	But if it does not obey you when you try to remove and wash it: then insert a sharp tool with a double edge, and tie it, and remove it; or insert beneath it a Ray of iron: and rotate your hand around all parts, until it is completely out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And be careful not to cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it cuts, it is difficult for you to wash it well, and it enters into the wound that has become injured.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	So then when you remove it all: then place it on a wound place that has been dipped in wine and oil, or oil only; and take care of the wound, until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	Which if it is contracted, has a curvature to the sides that has an edge to the parts, and is not like what we said concerning the straightness: then you must find on all parts of its curvature, and the locations of its edge.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then hang it with a hook until you have washed it all; and be careful when you cut into the section that is above it, or wound it up: for it will be difficult for you to wash it well on yourself, or remove it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	So then keep your caution.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The shape of the wound when it heals.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The shape of the hook.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not a curvature like the other hook, nor does it have acute extremities, so as to not wound the skin; and it has a slow bend, soft: for if it were slight, it would cut the skin with its subtleness: but it has too much grossness, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of veins from the leg.
Caput XCIII.	De extractione venae cruris.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs on warm ground, as in Al-Izzi's land and in Arab lands, and in dry, hot lands with little softness, that is, where grass does not grow nor do trees spring up.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is from putrefaction which occurs under the skin, as it occurs within the bodies of snakes and worms and lice, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this vein is a sharp inflammation in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the spot becomes sore and swollen.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to emerge from the site of the swelling, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When this end appears, then you should wrap a lead wire around it, whose weight shall be of a drachm and a half, to the nodule; and remove the lead wire from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever it emerges anything from it towards the outside, wrap that too in the lead, and mark that.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it should last a long time, then you shall cut a part of it, and wrap the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And you shall not cut its root before it has completely emerged.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you should cut it, it will wither, and go into the flesh: and it will cause pustules to form, and putrefaction in the spot, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it should be handled gently, and extracted gradually, until it has completely emerged from its root, and there remains nothing of it within the body: and from this vein emerge some men, who are, according to its length, five hands and ten fingers long.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now I have come to you, for it has reached the age of twenty years.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If, however, you should cut yourself in the course of your treatment: then you shall introduce a needle into its opening, and pierce it with a long needle, along with the body, until all that is in it is discharged from the matter: and administer the medicine of the place with remedies over several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then the care is with the cure of ulcers.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this indeed The vein has branches when it is many, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and many openings are found, and a branch goes out from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Then the care of it, as we have said in the division, and with what precedes.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	De the section on worms that are born under the skin, and it is called The trouble of the cow.
Caput XCIIII.	Head LXXIII.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This trouble is called in some place with us The trouble of the cow: because often it happens to cows, and there is one only, which is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it was seen in the whole body, ascending and descending: and it was shown by sense during its walking with its limb from one limb to another, until it stops wherever it stops in the skin, and a branch goes out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the corruption of some earth.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As happen worms and snakes, that is, earthworms, and roundworms in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And they are afraid of its evil.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it goes up in the body and ascends to the head, and reaches a place: then perhaps it opens within, and goes out, and destroys an eye: and this happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	But when you are to cure it, and to take it out, then it does not happen to it but during its walking, and the appearance of its sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore let you bind what is above it, and what is below it with strong constriction by a ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry up on the top of it, and take it out.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	That if it penetrates into the flesh, and not into itself: then put on the place a cautery with fire, until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And greater than what is feared, is its corruption, which corrupts an eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If you see it [the wound] having already reached the head near the eye, then tighten the brow above it with a good constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry above it, and remove it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the sick one should use self-purification of his body, with medicines that dissolve bad putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And he should beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	[On sectioning on disease] of Naker.
Caput XCV.	Head 105.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This disease is called in our language Naker, and it is a pain that happens in some member; then it passes from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I have already seen him, according as I report to you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a sick woman in some wounds.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she held out her arm, and I saw an inflammation in the armpit in the axillary vein.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after an hour had passed, I saw one inflammation go down with a torch, like the burning of the flesh, ascending at her shoulder faster than it can be: so that it is like flowing silver, when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Then the pain departed from that place, and was fixed in her shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then after an hour it moved, and ran over the rest of the body until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she reported to me that it was moving all over her whole body, according as I saw it.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was therefore amazed at the speed of its movement from one member to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I myself have never seen such a disease with my eyes before, moving in this way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I have seen many who have experienced pain from one member to another: and I have never seen it with my eyes, like what I saw in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that it was, except that the woman was of those who are found among the wounds of dried-up breasts: hence this sense of windiness is apparent.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	It is necessary that they should not appear according to this reason in those who are delicious and wet bodies, of secret wounds.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	But when you are curing it and the patient feels this pain, then if it is visible to you with the eye, as we said, then bind it above it and under it quickly: and dry it above it until it comes out that windiness: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	But if you do not see the place with your eyes: then cure it with the excretion of the body, and with what it expels windiness, and make them red with foul pills, and pills of serapine, and others.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the extraction of arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter LVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows differ according to their species, and according to the places in which they are lodged in the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	But there is a great difference between them: for some have large hooks, and some are sharp; and some are conic, and some are flat.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And of these there are three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And of these there are tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And of these there are stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	But those that fall into members of the body are of two ways.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For example, the members are conic from the main member, such as the brain, and the heart, and the liver, and the lung, and the kidneys, and the intestines, and the bladder, and similar to them.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	But when it falls into any of these members and you see to you signs of death, which I will tell you after, then you should extract the arrow from them, because death follows it in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	But when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep in the member, then pull it out, and cure the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For from the signs of a brain when it falls into it an arrow and penetrates the bone, and emerges from above the brain, there follow these: for they happen from this a bloody fainting, and blindness, and dizziness, and blushing in the eyes, and swelling, and stiffness in the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of thought, and loss of memory.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood will flow from the nose, or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps a speech will be cut off, and a beast will be destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And blood will flow from the wound's place, white like gruel.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And will emerge from it similar to meat water.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If then you see these signs, then refrain from cure, and draw out the arrow if not blood has flowed.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow that has entered the heart, are: for it is near the left nipple: and it feels as if fixed on a hard thing, not on a soft one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow has a movement similar to a pulse: and black blood flows from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And follows that cold of extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	So know, that death has come by certain means.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow that has wounded the lung, is: the flow from the wound of frothy blood: and the veins that follow the neck, run away, and change their color to pale.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out great, deep sighs: and seeks the cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	That if the arrow has entered the breast-bone, which is within the chest: then it is near the back ribs: and it becomes a great sighing with painful grumbling, and groaning: and all the shoulder muscles quiver.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow has entered into the stomach, then perhaps blood flows from the wound by something indigestible in food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow has entered into the belly and is fixed there: then blood flows from the wound by stool, or bile, or gut that has already been broken.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is therefore no hope for his cure, nor for drawing out the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	That if the arrow has entered into the bladder, and it flows out urine: and proceeds from it something toward the outside, and its pain is stronger on the sick: then know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you that I saw such arrows exist, as you mean by that arrow on your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is, because a man fell an arrow in his lacrimal eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	I therefore took it out from him on the other side, under the adipose of his ear: and he was healed, and nothing happened to him in his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I pulled out another arrow from the Jew, which had fallen in his adipose of his eye under his lower eyelid: and the arrow was now hidden, and I could not get at it except by its sharp end, when it was sticking in its wood: and it was an arrow of a Turkish bow, with a soft iron point, and there were no feathers.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	So the Jew was healed, and nothing happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I pulled out another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arab arrow, and that one had ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	So I followed it with two pins: and now it was submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	So I was careful with it, until I pulled it out: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I pulled out another arrow that had fallen in his abdomen: and we thought, that he would die of it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	So then after he had passed forty days, and nothing was changed in him of his sickness, I followed the arrow: and I devised to myself concerning it, and pulled it out: and he was healed, and nothing happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man on whom an arrow had fallen in his back, and the wound was healed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After seven years, he drew the arrow from the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman to whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and a bone was set upon her, and the arrow remained within her: and there was no change in any of her members, and she found no harm in any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man to whom an arrow had fallen into his face, and a bone was set upon him, and the arrow remained, not causing him much pain: and there were many similar cases.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I drew out the arrow from the prince of the king, which had fallen into his nose and had already turned towards the right side somewhat: and the arrow was entirely concealed.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	So they called me to cure him after the loss of the arrow for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	And I found the arrow-bone very stiff.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	So I examined it with a delicate attempt, and I did not feel it: and he himself felt a prick and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	So I hoped that it was from the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	So I plastered the place where there was the attracting and curative force of the arrow, confiding to him that it would heal, so that the mark of the arrow might appear to me as if it were being taken off: and no accident happened in that place suggesting that the arrow was still there.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	So I kept up the plaster for many days: and no accident happened, and the bone was set during that time: and he remained weak from the drawing out of it for a space of days, until one day he felt an arrow in his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me about that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	So I put an acute medicine on that bone, for many days, until it was healed over: and when I tried him, I felt a slight pain of the arrow still attached to the bone.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then, when the wound had healed over by means of that acute medicine, it seemed to me that the tip of the arrow became visible; and about four months elapsed with that time.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then, when the wound had increased and seemed to me that it was possible for me to insert my fingers into it and move them and not respond to exit: then I did not stop gently, and devised means for her with the means of inventiveness, until one day I succeeded in doing so with a certain angle of unevenly made forks, according to which their form became visible at the end of the chapter, and I removed it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the limb.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And the doctors say that cartilage is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	So I restored it, and the limb was consolidated, and the disease was healed with complete health: and he did not hurt at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the quality of extraction of certain arrows: that you set up that rule and meaning about it which I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For parts of this art and their distinctions do not understand themselves with a narration; nor does this book understand, and the careful artisan compares little to much: and when it is far from what is present, he understands a new operation, and a new instrument when extraneous things of this art happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say, that arrows do not come out of the body from which they are fixed except according to two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by attraction from a place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the opposite side of another part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which goes out from where it entered, or is an arrow proceeding in a fleshly place; and is attracted, and goes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	That if it does not obey to exit within the time in which it falls: then it is necessary that you leave it a few days, until it rotten the flesh which is around it: and its attraction is eased, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And likewise if it is fixed in a bone, and does not obey to you to exit, then leave it too for a few days: and again go out with its attraction and movement every day, until it goes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If he does not obey you at the exit after a few days, then it is necessary that you perform on him around the sagitta in the bone from all parts with thin terrae, until the sagitta are increased.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it and take it out.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If however the sagitta is fixed in the osse capitis, and has already gone into one of the ventrums cerebri, and appears from an accident which I have mentioned: then abstain from attracting the sagitta, and let it go, until it is even with that after a few days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the sagitta goes into the Sifach (a part of the brain), then death does not prolong itself for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the sagitta is not fixed, but only in the body of the bone, and does not penetrate all the way to the Sifach: and remains a few days sick, and does not happen to him any of those accidents which I mentioned: then devise in attracting the sagitta and taking it out.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If however it is firmly fixed, and does not obey you with regards to attracting it: then apply thin terrae around the sagitta, as I have told you: and then take care of the place, until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If however the sagitta has already gone into hiding in a place in the body, and is hidden and concealed from sensation: then seek it out with care.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel it, then attract it with some instruments which are suitable for attracting it.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If you cannot bring it out because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the sagitta in the deep, and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vessel: then find it out, until the wound is increased, and it is possible to take out the sagitta.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	That if they have ears to which it is attached, then free the flesh firmly held on them from all parts, with any device which you can: and devise, if it cannot be brought out by means of the ears in a fracture, and turning of them, until it comes away.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you are extracting the arrow of the shaft, in whatever place it is, then use your hand with forceps to all parts until you make it bleed: and the subtlest subtlety, so that the shaft does not break, and it becomes difficult for you to attract it, and its extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	That if you cannot get above it in one hour, then let go of it for a few days, until what is around it putrefies.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat it: for indeed if the flow of blood annoys you, then administer what we have said in its chapter: and guard your skill from the incision of the vein, or nerve, or chordae.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer skill in every way as possible to the healing of the arrow: and let it be with ease, and tranquillity, or tardiness, and firmness, as I tell you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that when you draw out the arrow, you make it so that it is weakened according to the figure, according to which it was with the shaft at the site of the arrow.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For it is more sure.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	But if this is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	But the arrow which has come out from the opposite part, or which is already proceeding out of it to the outside: or which makes a protuberance at the extreme end of the shaft by feeling from the upper part of the skin nearby, and you see it prominent: so cut off over it, and let the section be according to the quantity that they hold in it with forceps.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then attract it: for she becomes easy to come out by herself.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	But if it is retained in the bone, then turn your hand according to its roundness, until it presses the shaft into the bone, and lengthens itself towards it: and then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: let go of it for a few days: and then repeat it, until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	That if the wood of the shaft is in it, then push it with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If however the wood has fallen and you want to give it an impulse of movement: then introduce the instrument into it, so that the impulse is transmitted to the end of the arrowhead: and then push it with the same impulse.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If however the arrow is tumbled, then push it with the instrument that enters into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is relieved by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	That if the arrow is poisoned, then it should be, so that all the flesh is conveyed, in which is venenum: if it is possible for you to do that.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of it with what belongs to that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	That if the arrow is falling into the chest, or into the belly, or into the urethra, or into the side: and it is close to that which you feel with your touch, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and caute ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, if you see it, and take care of that, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the forceps, with which the arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	May their ends be similar to the point of the awl, which is made like a needle: when they grasp onto the arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And there are many kinds of them, big and small, medium and small, according to the size of the arrow, and the width of the wound, and the constriction.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	Form of the impelling concaues.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And form of the impelling surd.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the end of the surd like a rayon, so that the entrance of it into the tumbled arrow can be facilitated, and it can be pushed with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	This end of the impelling concaues is tumbled like a feather, so that the entrance of the arrow into itself can be facilitated and its impulse can be transmitted to it.

Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And phlebotomy of them is made after two ways.

Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	So Aniseptic is, that it convines to the section.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And of them are species broad, and subtle according to the width of veins and the shape of phlebotomy with myrrh sit broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it convines to the opening of veins occluded, full, coming out, appearing, thick, and those which contain gross blood, turbulent.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotomist is of lesser width, and more subtle at the extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it convines to the phlebotomy of veins which are subtle, which contain subtile citrinum blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Of the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	But the Basilica which is one of the three veins phlebotomy is a juggle:
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	For it draws blood out of sickness which is under the throat and the neck, from that which goes to the chest, and the phlebotomist takes it, because he guardeth, and sits over the fear from her: for under her is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If he should make a mistake and add bloodletting to the puncture, he would cut the artery and cause the flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	For this reason, when puncturing with bloodletting, one should not cut the artery: instead, it should be done with the help of a scalpel.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	That if the Basilica does not appear with a manifest appearance, then one should go and remove it from its place and change it to another or seek out some of its branches: or perform bloodletting at its site.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For this is made manifest, and one should cut it with a scalpel of Alne, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If you wish to perform bloodletting on this, then one should touch the branch of the arm before the brachial artery is closed, so that you feel the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the place with a caustice, and afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a scalpel of Alne, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And be careful that the incision does not fall into the space from the site of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see that the ligament has been tightened, and the inflammation at the place that you have marked with a caustic, then this inflammation is the inflammation of the artery: so keep it away from it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	That if you see blood rise at bloodletting, like a boy's urine, and it is pale blood, red in color: then you know that it is from the artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore bring your hand to the site and place your finger on it for a long time, and then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If then blood is cut off (for it is often cut off) then tighten the arm and let it go: and be careful not to move him at all: and set him on his feet with trepidation.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And let him not murmur for a few days, until he is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If then the blood does not cut off and hurts you: and there is no medicine present for you at that moment, then cut the artery if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	The extremities of it are cut off, and the blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the fascia of the fistula, and find it: take one half and bind it firmly on the site of the stricature as it descends with the ligament and powder until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then the care of it with what memory remains of the place from which the powder-flushing blood was cut off: and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in many dispositions, on account of the small wound, and possibility of the ligament from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	The phlebotomy of the vein of the fistula.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The phlebotomy of the vein of the fistula is a method that draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; since it is composed of the branch of the Basilica and the branch of the Cephalica, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it belongs to the phlebotome to make it over the fear from its phlebotomy, for under it is the nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If then he adds in the puncture of the phlebotomy, and finds the nerve, it happens to him that stupor, and difficult is its cure, and perhaps it does not cure completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve appears many times to sensation.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But if it is hidden in some men, and is slight, and does not show itself: then you should put your phlebotomy so that the phlebotome makes it with the Alethe, and remove the nerves with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	That if the vein is between two nerves, then find a vein in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	The head vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The phlebotomy of the veins of the head is a method that draws blood from the head, and confers it to the ailments of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And let there be in this vein of your own, if you will, so that the phlebotome makes it with the oil-phlebotomy, or with the myrrh-phlebotomy: for this is the saviour of all veins, because it is not under an artery, nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum Trium qua sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comotionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quandopruocate conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quadraginta annos.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	But if anyone wishes to perform phlebotomy in any way: it is necessary that he should clean his intestines before phlebotomy with a mild enema, if there is much feces retained therein: so that the waste matter from the intestines does not attract the gut by phlebotomy and harm the main organs.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	And let the patient not be tied up, that is, nausea: and let him not be drunk, nor let him be so drunk that he cannot move himself from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	And let him not be sick with water on him.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let phlebotomy be performed again after diarrhea, hunger, flow of blood, increase of sexual activity, toil, exercise, vigils, fasting, and all that dissolves virtue from the physical body or animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtleties of the humors before that, if the blood is thick with food and drink and medicine: if it is possible to do so.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let him take a bath, if he does not object to anything: or let him exercise himself in some way, so that the blood is refined.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And let him place phlebotomy in his chest on the third day, as we have said: and be careful so that his chest is emptied of all animal accidents on that day: such as pain, anger, fear: and all bodily accidents, such as labor, punishment, excesses, and those like them.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him make his own things present that he might have the custom of men from the aroma, and fragrance, and feast, and similar things by quantity of possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then the phlebotomist sits on a stool, which is higher than the phlebotomy place: then he takes his arm out, and rubs it with his own hand twice, or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then he tightens the ligature with the thongs, and twists it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be moderate, for when it is unequal, or because of an excess in the constriction, then it prevents the course of blood: or in its softening, then also it prevents the course of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then, after the tourniquet has been tightened, the person should hold their hands still while the blood is being clamped and let go, until the veins are swollen and feeling is restored.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then, the phlebotomist will clean the venipuncture site with a little oil, his own, ancient.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he will lay his finger, of his left hand, on the vein at the spot where he intends to perform venipuncture, slightly: so that the vein is not scared and the sound of the puncture is soft.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For it is from the veins that blood flows like a string being struck when a puncture is performed: and it is from those veins that has full blood flow: and when you place the syringe on it, it is squeezed under the syringe, and the syringe operator is deceived, and the syringe does not open the vein: and if it does open it, it is tight: so that, therefore, it is necessary that the syringe operator tighten his grip, and be vigilant in these matters at all times.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he will set down the syringe.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If then a vein does open from one drop of blood, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat the same drop of blood under that place a little, or above it with some haste: if the spot does not bleed.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	That if it does not bleed, nor feels weak, then send him away for a day, or two days: and do not tighten the ligature.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps, indeed, it attracts the blood because of the heat.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	And let him not enter a bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then he should delay the venipuncture, if he is fond of it.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	That if the opening is small, or blood runs slightly: and wait that there be not a quantity of blood that leaves the body as much as a gooseberry: then repeat the phlebotomy at the same place with care, and add a little to the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do this with some haste, before the spot bleeds: for, indeed, the spot that bleeds is at fault, when a person is bleeding a lot during the procedure.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If you see that he has already made a mistake, then do not continue to operate on him at all; for nothing is excusable in your eyes.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put something on top of the wound from the fat of an animal: for it softens the course of the blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than oil itself, and than any other oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer oil to all your bloodletting, except when the course of the blood is forbidden; and they make it with myrrh when put from one of them on the spot.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For the blood is thinned and made fluid when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If such a great aposteme should happen to occur in a place, for many times it happens, especially if one who is not phlebotomized is affected at that point or there is a small opening of the wound, then bind and put on top of the spot a sponge infused with water and salt, slightly warmed: and tighten it for an hour: for it is resolved.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And you should, in order to do that which has been done after the exit of blood from his own wound with its complement, or from another wound:
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	That if anything remains in the place after a few days of blackness or of fogginess, it does not harm that; and if there is a swelling, put on top of the wound some oil, or of myrrh dissolved: or something of the juice of mint, that is, of calamus or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And very often apostemes and eminences occur with bloodletting at the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	So put your hand on top of it; then if you feel a soft swelling when you press your hand on top of it, then that eminence is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Take care, so that you put on top of it something of what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood will flow from it of the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But put on it something with which there is a stop to the flow, so that the spot may heal.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound with the rest of the cure, until it heals over.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	It is fitting that every man should draw blood from another according to the quantity of his virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And that which appears in a vibrant color above the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let him be sent out until he turns red: and likewise, if you see him thick: then send him out until it thins out: and likewise, if it is sharp, until the sharpness is taken away from it.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is fitting for him who is full, strong, and resistant to the extraction of blood by one act, so that the phlebotomy of the vein is enlarged, and he becomes a phlebotomist on the back: and in him who is weak, it is the opposite.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is fitting that he should draw himself out in the vices, and that a tight hole be made: and better is it when administered in the phlebotomy of the vein, that it is a transverse section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this mode of phlebotomy is safer from the flow of blood, and from the incising of the nerve: and it is more praiseworthy, and healthier than phlebotomy by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to him who is accustomed to syncope at phlebotomy, it is fitting that he should eat light before phlebotomy with water of grain crushed: or secernentinum, if it is warm: and let him draw blood from him in six vices, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if the complexion is chilly, then let him take before phlebotomy bread infused in syrupy moly, or in syrupy de melle seasoned with spices, or in syrupy seasoned with odorous substances.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	That if syncope should happen at phlebotomy, and it is a cause of the exit of blood many: then let him take in a vessel water of meat, and syrupy odorous: and let him apply aromaticity with algalia, and stretch his chest when he uses it: and let him use the rest that we have spoken of in the division in the chapter on syncope from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wishes to let his arm go and let his blood out little by little according to the quantity of his virtue in continuous days, let him know that it is fitting for him to draw blood from another according to the quantity of his virtue.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Whoever wishes to bandage his arm and stop the flow of his blood, let him do so after the second day, and his body is strong. Then he should do this after seven hours or nine from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	However, whoever wishes to draw blood from his body towards the opposite side of the part that sways away: it is necessary that this be done on the second day or the third.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body there is already much blood heated and quickened, and causes a fever to occur: it is necessary that he leave this blood flowing in one direction, and extract from him a great quantity: and increase the opening until asyncopy occurs: after you have maintained all the conditions of phlebotomy: and put your hand over his pulse at the course of the blood, so that death does not occur at the place of syncopy.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Indeed many times it happens when the phlebotomizer does not know, and falls by negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when you wish to bandage an arm, and stop the flow of blood on the second day, that the orifice of the vein has already been closed, and make it difficult for the blood to exit, so that it rushes upon him with a sudden movement, and quickly curls over and extends.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For this is an evil thing, let go of him until the second day, until he is phlebotomized.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with the sharpness of phlebotomy that which has coagulated blood in the orifice of the vein, and put on him some dissolved salt in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place on him something of the tartar emulsion or sage, and place on him a soft compression until blood flows out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If, however, the vein has already been seared, then let go of it, and do not tie it up, until it is seared.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	That if necessity compels to stop the flow of blood on the second day, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize him above that place, or in an arm another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	But the tendon of the arm is phlebotomized at the place of the purple, and of the basilica, if they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed from them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And what is the quality of phlebotomy, so that the sick person may put his hand into warm water until it turns red, and appears new to the eye.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then let him be tied with a little constriction in the middle.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then let the phlebotomy be made according to the cross-section gradually, not according to the length and not according to the length; and let it be an open space wide and let your phlebotomy be like that, which you make across the wrist a little.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the blood flows out, then repeat the hand into warm water and let the blood run into the water until you have a need to stop it.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if you are in summer days, then you are excused from repeating the hand into warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	Indeed, much depends on how long the blood runs in warm water during the cold season.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And this kind of phlebotomy is safer for all kinds of wounds because it does not cause a pulsating wound or nerve injury.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	But phlebotomy certainly saves the hands of the right side, which is suitable for patients with liver diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And what is the quality of phlebotomy, so that you tie the hand with a little string and not the hand itself after you have put it into warm water until it bends, and appears very much to the sense.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then let the phlebotomy be made by crossing it.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it all, it will not harm that at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And preserve your hand after phlebotomy.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For under her are the nerves of the fingers stripped from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then repeat the hand to warm water and let the blood run in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not repeat the hand in warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the wound and stop the flow.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	But when you extract a quantity of blood according to need, then put oil and salt on the wound: so that it does not quickly solidify.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And it is also necessary that you should make the same incision on every branch which is broken.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The proper way to make a ligature for a vein is with your left hand, since it is concerned with the spleen; and you should do the same for its phlebotomy, as you did for the second one.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	But the ligature for the veins is to be used for ailments which are in the lower part of the body, such as those of the mother, and retaining the monthly flow, and ailments of the kidneys and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar ailments from illnesses.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that he should put his sick foot into hot water; and make friction on it until the blood comes out, and tie above the incision of the foot with a strap.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the site of the veins is at the heel, which appears towards the thumb; and there are many branches emanating from it on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	So it is to be phlebotomized in a larger branch of it, or at the heel in its aggregate; for it is better and healthier.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	For if you phlebotomize it on the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are under it on the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy where you want to incise it across, as if you do not wish to incision it; and let the phlebotomist be ready.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	But if the flow of blood is prohibited, then turn his foot around in hot water; and let the blood not run into it until it has come out.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	That if the vein is cut in the first place, then it should remain with the phlebotomy to the upper ones for a while, since the site is healthier, and do not be afraid of injury from it when you are drawing blood, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And likewise with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	But the site of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel on the side of the forest.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the treatment of hemorrhoids is to cut off the tender parts, when it is due to warm blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of phlebotomy is that it should be done in a hot bath, and it should be strained: and tighten his legs from the sides of the anus up to the heel four fingers, with a thin long thread: for this does not appear except for that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When, therefore, it appears, then phlebotomize her according to whatever skill you have, or according to the turn of events: and it is better, or as if you were to cut her with an incision, or separate her by a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For the place of her is salutary, and herself is hidden much in many men.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	That if you do not draw her out, and does not appear to the sense at all: then phlebotomize some of her branches, and that is which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the earlobe: and from the nerves, and let run a quantity of blood as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then untie it loosely, and place on the spot of phlebotomy skin, and tighten the spot.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For quickly he is healed.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Of Ventilation, and quality of use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter LXXXXVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Ventilations are made from horns, and from air, and from heat.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And the ventilation is made according to two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	When with scarification, and extraction of blood: and another is ventilation without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this ventilation which is without scarification, is according to two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or indeed is when fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the ventilations which are administered with scarification and extraction of blood are four times places in the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is Ventilation of the Scalp, and it is last of the head: and Al-Khel, and is middle of the neck: and ventilation of the two cheeks, and are two laminae of the neck from two parts at once: and ventilation of the mind, and is under the mandible in the lower mouth: and ventilation of the two spatulas: and ventilation of the two achilles at the end of the tail: and ventilation of the two fires, and are middle of the two arms: and ventilation of the two legs: and ventilation of the two cheeks.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	For indeed you shall not draw blood from small veins that are scattered in the flesh, and because of this there is no power in them, as is the case with him from phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	And it is not necessary that venesection should be performed whether with fire or without fire, in any sickness that is produced by the accumulation, until the whole body has been emptied.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	That if necessity compels to venesection on account of sickness or custom, we should administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at its end, and at its middle, and at whatever time it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	That is, for there is a man who, when the blood multiplies in him, until he requires its extraction by venesection, finds in his head a headache, and fainting.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And there is one who finds accumulation and reddening on his face, in his head, and on his neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And there is one who finds itching on his face, in his forehead, darkness, and dullness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And there is one who scratches the place where he received venesection.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And there is one whose laughter multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And there is one who finds the taste of blood in his mouth: or he swallows it with his tongue, and spits it out.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And there is one whose sleep multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And there is one who sees in his sleep blood and reddening, and slain men, and plagues, and things similar to those.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When then shall we perform venesection when we see anything of this, and especially if it is in the middle of the third month: let us do so after two or three hours have elapsed since midday.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	And the caution regarding venesection is: for it brings headache to the head, and it runs into the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	However, it is necessary that it should be after the whole body has been emptied.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this venesection is by place in relation to phlebotomy of the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not fitting that he who has a cold complexional complexion should use it, or in whom there is catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it makes him very weak.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And for that reason it is not fitting that they who are old should use them, and in whom there are diseases of the head due to cold.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But whoever uses this frequently, forgetfulness will be born on him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And for that reason it is necessary that you follow the instructions of Ventosatori, so that he puts his hand with a gentle breeze towards the lower part, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventosation or Alkehel, is the place of phlebotomy of Fusca, and of the phlebotomy of Basilica, and for that reason it confers ash, and constriction of anhelatus, and fissures of the instrument of anhelatus, and cough, and filling.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that it be driven by a gentle breeze of Alkehel somewhat, because if it is put downwardly, it generates weakness in the heart, and in the stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	The ventosation however confers pain to the accidental injuries in the head, and to the eyes, and to the headaches, and to the perforations, and to the pain in the roots of the teeth; and it is the place of phlebotomy of Basilica.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary that you follow the instructions of Ventosatori, so that he does not hold his hand with scarification: lest he strike an artery, and cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	But the ventosation under the chin, confers alcohol in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar ailments that are in the mouth: and it is the place of phlebotomy of Alihehrich, which are in the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	But the ventosation of the spatula, confers to the alchafach, which is made by a replexion, and by a heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	The ventosation of the internal parts however, confers a juementum of phlebotomy of the three veins, of Basilica, and of Fusca, and of Cephalica: for itself it attracts blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh: and these small veins attract the grosser veins from them, until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	It is fitting that you instruct Ventosator not to make too many incisions, for the place is bare of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	But the vents that venose on the perineum bring hemorrhoids of the anus and ulcers of the lower parts.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And you should instruct Ventosator to make a large vent and to use metal, for the place requires strong suction, and perhaps the fine vents might break: and let there be a large scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	But the vents of the legs diminish by a visible amount: for they draw blood from all the body, and bring on old pains in the kidneys and ligaments and blisters: they induce menstruation, and bring hemorrhoids and a twinging pain: and stand in the place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and of the alhorcobene.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body very much, and bring about syncope in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the duration of the alhorcobene is close to that of the two vents of the legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the vents is that you should place the vent in the first place in a hollow place, and suck with moderate suction: and do not prolong the position of the vents, but put them quickly, and move them quickly so that the humors go to the place by way of gleichness: and do not cease to repeat that and continue, until you see the place already red and swollen, and a rubedo of blood appears: then therefore scarify, and repeat suction slowly.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the disposition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For he who is of tender flesh and rare porridge, should scarify himself once only, not more: lest the place ulcerate.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct Ventosator to make the scarification wider and deeper: and temper suction in ease, and speed, and moving sway.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	For if there is grossness of blood, then you should scarify yourself twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In fact, with the first incision, the road to the subtle blood is opened and it is washed out; and with the second, the precise extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If indeed the blood is foul, then let a third incision be made so that the last result is achieved.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we want to extract blood little by little or only a bit at a time, one incision is enough for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	That if we want multiple extractions of blood, then we make several incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it must be made, that an extensive incision is made; and the equal depth of the incision, is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which needs to be administered from oils in relation to the ventilation of winds, and what causes the wind-chill?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	IN that which has a thick, hard, dark skin and its pores are closed, it is necessary to oil the areas of ventilation with open, soothing, and melting oils: if it is in the time of summer, such as is the oil of almond, or the oil of olive, or the oil of apricot seeds, or the oil of cucumber seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the time of winter, then olive oil, or lotus oil, or chamomile oil, or sarzine oil: and similar ones.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If indeed there is a cold excess, then olive oil, or bitter almond oil, or balsa-root oil, or alburnum oil, or annerose oil: and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If indeed the wind-chill has large pores and tender flesh, then it is necessary to prevent the use of oil, and these areas should be washed after ventilation with rosy water, or cold water, or sun water, or cucumber water, or portulaca water: and similar ones.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	This is for the one whose blood has a lot of moisture, washes the winds with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and with sumac: and similar ones.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	Whoseever the swellings are great, he shall wash his ventosas with old wine, or with water of samzuc, or with decoction of anis, or with chamomile; and these are similar.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that the ventosas should be bathed in a bath, or in a pan of a bath; and it is also necessary that he should administer after going out from the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary that anyone should sleep after the ventosas.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is that which it is necessary that he be treated before the ventosas? And what is that which it is necessary that he be treated after the ventosas?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that, you shall consider first of all: then if the one who is treated is cholerical, and the sharpness and inflammation of his blood are great: then he should take something that will cool him down, such as granatum muscatum; also lettuce with vinegar and leeks, and secandubain, and juleb: and these are similar.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And put away from him the foods that cause itching, and all kinds of meat that he should eat, and prepared foods with honey: and these are similar.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And whoever has a cold complexio, he shall take in a drink syrup of honey, or of almy, or alssecandubain made from seeds; and he shall take medium strong wine, which is between new and old: and it should be commanded that he eat in moderation.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And put away from him the foods that cause itching, and all kinds of meat, and birds, that is, many birds: and let him eat quail that are raised in a cage.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink of the day of the ventosas and the phlebotomy be greater than the food: and it is necessary that a certain man should take in a drink some kind of toryac alfaroch, or medicine made from musk, that is, granatum muscatum, or alselsith before the ventosas; and before the phlebotomy, or after: so that the principal members may be strengthened, and the blood be softened.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary for them to take it out of a hot vessel.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	¶ About Ventosis without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	But the venose that are without scarification, are venose that are placed on the liver, and the spleen, and the podagra, and on the stomach, and the umbilical region, and the places of the bowels, and the skin of the anus: for these limbs do not suffer from scarification applied to them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not questioned about them, except by the attack of blood from one member to another member: as we place the venose on the breasts in the disease of flux of blood from the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them, so that we may remove cold venosity that has entered into a member: as we place the venose on the stomach and the umbilical region.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For itself it tightens the limb, and warms it, and takes away the pain because it has resolved that venosity.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	Also, we place them on the kidneys when a deposit occurs there, or a stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For by its own attraction it perhaps opens the deposit, or removes the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And likewise, when it is placed on the liver and the spleen, to resist venosity that is coming into them from both sides.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these Venose are administered with a little cut only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And they are sometimes administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in pleural diseases: and that is, so that the venose may be filled, and great, with hot water alone, or with water in which have been boiled herbs that are fitting for it.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	Form of Venose administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its opening be two fingers wide, according to which form we have made it: and let the quantity of it in the depth be half a palm: and let it sit on the outside of the member that is about the middle of it, a small hole, according to the quantity that is put into it: let it be made of copper, or brass, with a margin that is broad, soft, equal, smooth: so that it may not hurt the member at its position on top of it: and let there be a wire across the middle of it, made of copper, or iron, where a candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this good wine is great, greater than we have told, and less little, according to the health and age of him who drinks it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For winds are good for young men, and other things make a man weak, as wind does for young men, and as bulk of body does.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of this wine when put on fire on the member is, as if you light a candle with fire from linen that is out of place, or a small candle made from wax: and set it on the middle of the back which is in the middle of the wind: so that the heat of the fire may surround the lower part of the wind, so that the body does not burn.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then put on the member: and let the finger be placed over the hole that I have said, until we hold the wind: while we are holding it, let us take away the finger, and the vapor shall come out through that hole, and the wind shall immediately be released.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then set fire to the linen according to its shape, and repeat doing so if you are able to endure it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In the wind, however, which is administered while sick with pleurisy with water, there is neither a transverse member nor a hole: and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and put on the member alone.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this wind is the better when it is greater, as it takes a lot of water, for it is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Regarding the suspension of blood-sugar.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter L IX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Blood-sugar are not administered in many, unless the member is impossible to hold wind because of its smallness, such as a lip or gums, and similar things.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a naked member, stripped of flesh, such as a finger, or nose, and similar things.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality for using them is: that you might come from blood-sugar which are in sweet waters, pure from corruption.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are dismissed day and night in sweet water, until they are hungry, and there is nothing left in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is drained first with phlebotomy, and then with ventosis.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wash the member with nurses' water until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then place a poultice on top of the wound.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When it is well-filled and the discharge is heavy, and there is a possibility of suction at the site with ventosis, then it is more effective to dress the wound: otherwise, then wash the area with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with lot of water, and rub it, and express it.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the flow of blood is prolonged after the application of sanguine sugar, and it remains sticky: then put a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on top, until the stickiness goes away.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood increases, then sprinkle on top of the wound ground turmeric or eggshells, and similar things from astringents: until the blood is absorbed.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or place on top of the area half-parts of scraped herbs: and leave them, until the herbs adhere to the area, since the blood is absorbed.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if it is needed to repeat the application of sanguine sugar, change them when possible.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If sanguine sugar is prohibited by suspension, then wash the area with recent blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or set it aside for a time, until something of the blood has come out.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then place them on top, because they themselves, when they feel some of the blood, adhere immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When you want to remove them, sprinkle on top of them something of ground aloe or salt or ash, and they fall immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	The End of the Second Part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	The Third Part of the Surgical Book of Albucasis.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A Universal Discourse on Restoration, Dislocation, Treatment, and Twisting, and Similar Topics.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also frequently necessary in the art of Medicine, and it includes the restoration of a fracture, and the dislocation of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know ye sons, that ye have here a stout and sturdy chapter of the art of Surgery and Plaster, which is taken from an ancient book, neither read nor seen by you, nor any of the doctors or apothecaries of your time, who have never read the ancient book from which it is extracted, nor read one word thereof.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason, this method is fitting, because it is a secret of the sciences known on our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I was never good in it at all, and I did not attain to it except because of the length of reading the ancient books, and study on their intelligence, until I drew out the science from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experiment and study with the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And I have already described for you from it in this chapter all the science that contains my knowledge: and with regard to experiment which I abbreviated to you, after I shortened it to you, and freed it from extension, and shortened it by abstraction, and showed it at the end of depreciation: and I formed in it many forms out of forms of instruments that are administered in it, when it is out of depreciation addition, as I did in two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	The highest, and collections out of broken bones, from which the premise is necessary before we begin to recollection of members of fracture, and long time for each one.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary that we say in the prologue of this chapter, that the speech and chapters are considered at which the craftsman is thought in the first place on its veracity: namely that you, and who are willing, know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say then, that when it happens to anyone fracture, or dislocation, or torsion, or fall: then you have to be prepared first in phlebotomandum him and soluendum it, or both at the same time: if it does not prohibit something, like weakness of virtue: or is he who happened anything from those boys: or an old man decrepitus: or is the time of vehemence heat, or vehemence cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then he is satisfied with his food, and cold foods, and meat of birds, and hair: and prohibits wine, and fatty meats, and what fills the blood vessels: and prohibits all food that fills the blood vessels.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	When you have recovered from your heat and are no longer in a state of fever, and you have not poured out any matter onto the member, then return to your usual regime first with those who used to do so.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the broken jaw therefore begins to be healed, then it is necessary that the sick person eat food that is nourishing, thick, dark-colored, and rich in substances: as food made from wheat flour mixed with water, and rice, and beans, and legs of beef, and entrails, and birds, and fresh fish; and strong wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For this regime, when the blood clotting from the break is faster and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that broken bones, when they are in the first age of decrepitude and old age, cannot continue and solidify according to their nature forever, because of the drying up of their members: and they solidify and continue what is in the end of lightness, like the bones of young boys.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature fills a broken bone with something similar to glue on all sides, in which there is richness and it clings and binds itself together, until it is joined together from one side, and is tied together from one side, until it has come to the end of strength and solidity, as it was at first, until it does not prevent its operations: and for this reason it is necessary that you place nourishing food in the sick person's diet, in which there are riches, and richness, and richness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the types of breaks are various, according to the diversity of the members: for a break in the leg is different from a break in the skull: and a break in the breastbone is different from a break in the spine: and likewise all the other members differ from each other: and I come with a reminder of all the types of breaks exposed in their own chapter, distinct from the rest.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the species of bone break also differ from one another.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For that reason his fracture is arcuate, aside from what happens to him with stars.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And when his fracture is according to the length of the bone: and there are fractures of his sagittais, that is, stars, and additions coming from, as they are in the calamus, when it is grasped with the knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not coming from: and there is a fracture with ulna and dislocation in the head: and there is a fracture a small crack.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every kind of art, or special instrument in restoring him, according to which comes his remembrance, separated in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from that it is known the fracture of the bone, is its flexibility, and eminence: and appearance of it to sense, and sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore it is not in place the flexibility appears, and sound at the touch of your hand when you press the bone with vibration, and there does not come a great pain from it: then it is not broken there, but possible that there is flexibility, or a small crack: so you do not need to move him with your hand and compression at all, but put on it with care from doctors, whose memory comes from after the time that it suits the place: then tighten gently.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you shall know that the place when it is arcuate, and split in two, aside from what happens to him with stars, yet all part of it moves apart from its other: then it is necessary for you, that you begin at your hour from now to straighten it, making even it before it happens to him the apostema heat.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If then it happens to him the apostema heat, then let you leave him days a few, until he rests the apostema.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then even him according to whatever way can from length and ingenium.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And you shall know that the restoration of it, and its making even, is easier than of the bones, in which happen stars.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tighten him, according to which comes your remembrance of him.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If there are fractures in the bones, then it is necessary to extend this broken member from two parts, if the hand is involved, or the foot: or with your own hand, if the member is small: or with two ropes, or a rope and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such that you place the member on a place equal to its natural position, until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then take care, so that you can bring back these additions with all ingenuity, and according to any form that you can in your places: and let it be careful according to your strength, so that no pain happens over the weak one through your operation, nor through neglect: and let it be careful according to your strength, that you apply one two bones with his partner, according to better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that hour, that you try and touch it with your own hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If then you see anything different there, straighten it out, and make it equal according to the quantity of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And take care that the extension is gentle, and the pressure strong, as many do with dull-witted people.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For often happen through their operation itself a warm apoplexy, or a contraction in the member: for we have already seen this from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then connect after the equality, and the setting of the operation, and the tightening of its member, and rest, and peace: and warn the weak one about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And let the member be careful not to move it in the hour of their weakness, and its sleep during its resolution, and agitation, and its defecation, and all its movements at the last power of itself.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And so that it is careful, so that the position of the member does not remain in a position from which pain follows.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, because when it feels the pain of the member's position, or injury: then it should be moved, so that you change its position from that with which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And take care with him, so that that position of his is equal and straight: lest there come about in the limb a deviation, when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the stricture of the broken member is, according to which narow.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You should know that broken limbs differ in their fracture, and in their size, and in their form.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Which of these are small, such as the arm, and the finger, and the foot, and similar to them, then it is fit that there be an involution of soft cloth, thin.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Which however of these are thick, such as the hip, and the shin, it is fit that there be in them a involution of broad, hard cloth.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Since the broad ligament connects the large member, and tightens it from all parts with an equal tension, so that it does not become affected by a bruise.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin after you have drained off your liniment suitable for that place, in soft cloth over the site of the fracture.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to involute the ligament over the site of the fracture three or four times, as much as the limb deserves: and tighten your hand with the ligament a little.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then move with it to the upper part from the site of the fracture, and tighten less than your own tension that you tightened the broken place: and tighten as much as that tension.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then lengthen yourself with the involution a little from the site of the fracture, and soften your tension slowly, until you have taken away from the place a great deal.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another poultice, and involute it again over the broken place.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then move with the involution to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the involvement and softening of it, as we said in the first superior involution.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then put between the involutions soft cloth or cloth, with which to make equal any deviation of the fracture, if there is a deviation in it: and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then I carefully removed the old one and put on a new one.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then immediately place equal-sized stars over the incisions if there is no swelling or heat.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If there is however swelling or a blister: then place over it what sits [there], and remove the swelling: and let it go for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tie the stars tightly over it.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the stars be made from the mid-section of a cane that is flat and shaped wisely: or let them be made from wood from which are made sieve-like cribs, which are made from pine, or splinters, that is, palm branches, or from tar: and let the width of each star be, according to this form, and this figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the star which is placed over [the wound] should be somewhat larger and wider than the others: and the length of the star should be according to what is suitable for the member in size and shape.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tie the stars together with another thread, according to the first stricture of the same form.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie it from above with diagonal threads, according to what we have said about the stricture: and let it be, so that your stricture is over the site of the fracture more: and as much as the length from the fracture increases, so does the stricture decrease.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it should be that the middle threads in thickness and fineness are made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	Because if the threads are thick, such that from them hanging on the outside of the member with the thread from the chord made of twisted linen there is a great mistake: for it falls when out of its quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And again, fine threads do not agree: because you would not achieve what you want by means of the stricture with them.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger's space between one star and another.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	Because if a weak person is left lying under the stars after the stricture in healthy places: then place soft straw, or red wool, under them until there is no injury from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When there is a fracture with the ulna, and there is a disruption in the skin, I will speak of it in the second chapter due to its uniqueness.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And you should know that not every broken limb needs to be held with splints from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is, because the limb is large when it is broken, it should not be put on a splint above the joint, except after five days or seven or more, according to your security from the onset of gangrene.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the way that ancient people used to splint, which are placed above the fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The common shortened way of splinting, for restoring fractures, suitable for many complexions, especially for women and children; since it is not affected by heat or cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is so that you take from the flour that is to be ground, and there is a flour that hangs on the walls of the mill when it is moved by the mill; and put it together as it is, except for the sifting of it with alba; and place its coating not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	The other way of splinting, for restoring fractures, dislocations, and twists.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take also myrrh, acacia, and sandalwood, and mastic, and molasses; and the juice of all these, and aloes of both sexes, each XX drachms, and alethin, XX drachms, to be boiled with alba; or with alethin if the complexion is hot.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this splint.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is a good composition, quickly healing broken bones, and suitable for many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	The other way of splinting, which also confers with fractures and twists.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take also mastic, and myrrh, and alethin alba, of all these XX drachms of each, and acacia XVI drachms, and bolus Armenian XVI drachms; they are to be well kneaded together, and sifted, and mixed with water, or with alba; and let them be administered.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	The mode of poultices for bandages, and for bones separated from their places; it calms the pain, the injury, the cutting of the bone, and the fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take wool wetted with oil and immersed in vinegar and oil-decocted; and place it on the spot.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And this poultice has no power of restoration, but it is good for calming hot abscesses; and it drives away the pains on its own.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	The mode of poultice, which restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of fig tree that are sound, and leaves of wild papaw; and dry them all, and make a poultice of both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	The mode of a shortened poultice, administered at the restoration of a fracture of the bone; and when you wish to resolve a hot abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take roots of marshmallow and of chamomile and of wild flower, and of herb-grain, all in equal parts; dry them all, and make them into a poultice with wine, unless it is a member that needs to be warmed.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it needs to be warmed, then make it with water of coriander seeds moistened, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	The mode of a stronger poultice for the resolution, which is different from this one, when the abscess becomes hard to be restored.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take roots of marshmallow and of flax seed and of mullein and of mealy-seed and of sweet marjoram and of chamomile, all in equal parts; dry them all, and make them into a poultice with water of willow, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All this depends on the heat of the member, and on the calm of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates, however, in his book did not say that a broken member should be placed on poultice made of ashes and oil; no other: and he related, that it should be between coarseness and tenderness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	But Galen, however, used to place on a broken member, at the restoration of it, things that dry up heat, such as myrrh and aloe and olive oil, and similar things from those which we have related.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The method of making plasters for injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take mugg, and chickpea, and hair of man's incisorous teeth, or feather of bird's wing, and amber, and equal parts of salt: they are to be ground, and sifted, and made into a plaster; and let it be made from these.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	But the quantity according to what is necessary, that the ligature remain, and then dissolve, you are to consider then, if it does not happen to the sick man pain, nor itchiness, nor moves the broken bone from its place: then do not dissolve it over many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If it should happen to him in the place itchiness severe, or disturbing pain, or swelling: then approach, and dissolve at the hour itself, and take away the plaster from him: and receive a linen cloth, or sea sponge, wet with lenitive: and dip it in tepid water, and wash with it the place, until the itchiness is calmed, and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let go of the member to rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then put over it the succous cloth, dipped in vinegar and oil, or oil infused: and bandage over it at nightfall, so that he be safe from heat, and the swelling of the member subsides, and the pain of him moves away.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then again you are to bind it with a loose ligature, and make the plaster thin: and do not bind him with your own constriction first, and fine things, until he is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see, that the swelling, and redness, and pain, and inflation, and all accidents are now completely gone away, and the plaster and ligature do not irritate, then again you are to do as you did before, equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If it does not happen to the member any of those things which we said, then do not dissolve it over three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when that is dismissed after twenty days all of it, according to what appears to you from the dissolving of the member, as we said, until at times it seems to adhere to the fracture, and the coagulation of meat comes close to it: add also then to the ligature more than your first ligature all over: and add also in the swelling of food, according to what preceded its memory.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If you see the place of fracture already drying up and becoming weaker than necessary: then you should know that nourishment is forbidden to reach it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	So wrap it up with warm water wherever there is a crack, and let it rest for three days, and then relieve the swelling slightly.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	By this operation, therefore, the member runs to nutrition and heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But that which do the dull restorers from a fracture member, if not restored first, and second because it should be, and restored according to the tortuosity, is an error of their operation, and a great fear: and if it were right, the ancients in their books would say so, and operate with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see anywhere of theirs in that at all, and better is not to do that.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	§ On the making of an accident in the head.
Caput III.	[II].
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	There are various kinds of fractures, and many forms of them: and their causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For from a fracture there is one which is made by impact, and impact carries the bone off entirely as far as it reaches to the syphac, which is under the bone, such as it does in wood: and for that reason this kind of fracture is called the axial fracture.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or a certain bone is hit by an edge and hits the face of it, and does not penetrate with its cut to the very end of it: and this kind of fracture is called the Kalaan fracture, that is, an absolute sliding.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And this is a break between two fractures, or great, or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is one fracture that is a crush, or a grinding: and its cause is impact with a stone, or falling on a stone, or the like.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also one that pierces, which is coming close to a pannus, which is under the bone: or is in the face of the bone: and this is also one of those two fractures between which is small or great.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And from fracture is, which is hidden in bone in subtility hair: and is small crack, and for that it is named this kind of fracture Capillaris.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from these is fracture, which happens by accident, or by hitting a stone, and similar ones that make the layer of bone go inside, and makes a hole: such as happens in the caldarium of air when it happens to him a hit, and some of them are made inside.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And indeed much is this thing in heads of damp bones, as are the heads of boys.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And these species of fracture are separated by the age of the body, and I come to remind myself of all this thing in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we know all these species of fracture by examination on them, and with their research, and by removing the corrupted meat that is on them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	And indeed this species of fracture is recognized by the fact that it is found on the bone, and is scrubbed off, and put on it with caustic: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In cure of the fracture, you should consider first the nursing injuries: then if you see from these injuries what means a clear meaning over fear, such as black eye, and spread, and loss of mind, and cutting of voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and outlet of eyes, and redness of them, and similar to them from these injuries in many dispositions, without doubt he will not heal: and if you see non-terrifying injuries to him, and hope for his health: then begin to treat him.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	What is, if it has come to you wounded first with injury: and this is in the days of winter, then you should try to remove the bone before the day of the twelfth.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the days of summer, then you should try to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone from a flap, and these injuries we have described.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the fracture of the bone has reached the membrane touching the brain, and is with a little and attraction: then it is necessary that you should break the part torn up, and crushed, as I will tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is that you should shave the head of the wounded person: and detect on the bone in any way possible to you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is leprous on the sick.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	That if it happens to you in the detection of the bone that a flow of blood or hot pus: then oppose it with that which is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is that you should fill the place with cloths steeped in wine, and rosin oil: and make the wound quiet, until the pus is dried up, and are secure from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the cure of the bone, and removal thereof.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is to be done according to two ways.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One way is that you should break the bone with a sharp chisel: and this is the form thereof.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then take another Incisory behind the first one by as much as you will: and this is the form thereof.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then also take another Incisory wider than the second one: and this is the form thereof.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second way is that you have with you a number of chisels different: some of them are wider than others, and some of them are shorter: and they are at the extremities of their sharpness, and are of iron, or of brass: and use ease in striking on the chisel, so that it does not hit the head, and hurts itself.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	But if the bone is strong and hard: then it is necessary that you should bore around it before administering the chisels with lead which are called lead-plums: and they are not so named except because they do not pass beyond the end of the bone to the flesh behind it: for that is the end round over it, under its acute head, similar to a margin, and a little circle prevents its plunging down into, and penetrating the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And it is fitting that you should receive from these terbri a great number, each of which corresponds to the quantity of the thickness of bone, until the present one is present for all the head terebrum: whose acute quantity in length and brevity lies according to the quantity of the thickness of its skull. And this is the form of the three species of terbri, or trepanas.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of piercing around the fractured bone, is that: you should place the terebrum on the bone, and rotate it with your fingers, until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the terebrum to another place and put what is between all the holes of the quantity of thickness, or around it.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the incisors what is between all the holes from the bone, and make it finer than you can on it at the end of lightness, as we have said, until you eradicate the bone, or with your hand, or with some other instrument that you have prepared for it: such as tenaculum, and subtile forpi.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary, so that you should be cautious of any kind of touch, not to let the terebrum or any of the incisors touch anything sharp.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have thus circled the bone by piercing it, and separated it from the syringomyelia, if it is continuous with it, and you extract it, then you should shave, and make equal the extremities of it that remain in the bone with another similar incisory instrument.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it is necessary that it be small and fine with other incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	That if there remains anything of the bones little, and fragile: then take it with ease, with what is with you of instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then be careful of the screw after that with oil and grease which we have said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another mode of the operation is easy, far from fear: which Galen said, and praised himself greatly: and this is his saying.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	Necessarily it is necessary for you, first of all, that you begin to lift up the bone's part from the place where the fracture is more intense and more obvious: until, when you have lifted up that part, and have placed under it this lens-shaped incisor, whose this is the form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens-shaped part, smooth does not hurt anything; and the sharp sides of it, when it moves on its two sides along the length, as you see: so that the lens-shaped part is placed on the sifon, facing the sharp side into the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then hit over the incisor on a part with a small mallet, until you hit all the bone with ease, as it turns out: and you are safe from panic, because there is no accident in it, which you really fear.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the medicant is not a fool of men, and more ignorant of his own: and if he were not asleep, then if there remained something attached to the bone from the pannicle in some places, it would hit itself from that man with the end of the lens-shaped incisor, and would free itself from him with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is freed from him without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate as far as the pannicle, and that which is cut off from the bone is the shape of it, and there remain in it roughness and subtle swellings: then it is necessary that you should rub off that roughness, and pluck out those swellings with sharp knives from which you have prepared a number of different quantities, so that it is possible for you to administer them in all places more convenient for them, and straighter for their shapes, according to the surgery which leads you, and this broken bone, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you should administer in your ratio, first of all, the edge of the bone, wider of those razors.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then cut the uterus after the same.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do that according to continuity, until you have reached to administer the narrowness, and the thinner of all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In every one of the remaining wounds of the lungs, the hair-like, and the fragile, it is necessary to administer care according to that which leads to the rectification of it.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And this is a thing that does not hide over everything, to which in this art is any study, and stood on what we have written, and showed in the large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	But if the little patch has been put on it when you pierce the bone: then it is necessary that you take the linen cloth, according to the quantity of the wound, and dip him in the rose oil, and put him on the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another piece of cloth doubled, or tripled, and dip him in the wine and rose oil, and put him on the first cloth: and make that which you can do easier over that, so that it does not chafe the wound.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer over it the wide ligament: and do not tighten him, unless according to the quantity which holds the bone only: and let go of him with this cure one day, or two days, until you are safe from the hot shower.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve him, and administer after it the medicines with which is superfluous dryness: like the roots of the lily, and the flour of the herb, and the powder of the thistle, and the aristolochia, and such: and it is, that you make from these medicines a powder, which powder is scattered over the bone as are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And administer universally on it all medicine of its property whose is to clean up, and does not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And cause according to your virtue, that the bone is in your cure clear: and it does not sit in it the grease of the ointment, nor the filthiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not leave the virus aggregari in it at all: because when the virus aggregates over the little cloth of the brain, it corrupts him, and putsrefies him, and occurs over great malice after that: and has already occurred in the scalp, when it is washed out by him, especially when the care of him is neglected, the black spot on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore, if such accidents occur in an infirm person, know that it is certainly deadly.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if the blackness does not occur, unless a medicine is applied to it which makes it black: then you should take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and linseed with them, and wrap them in a cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place the wound on a couch: then care for the wound with the types of treatment that are appropriate, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	For the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter III.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that the nose is not broken unless both parts of it break at the same time, or one of them: for there are two bones in it; because the lower part is cartilaginous, it does not break, and does not happen to it except by rubbing, and tortuosity, and shape.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts of it breaks, then you should insert your little finger into the nostril and tighten it with your index finger and thumb until the nose returns to its natural shape: and do this with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware lest by your operation you cause him pain on the sick bed.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	That if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach that part with a finger: then you should smooth out the edge where the thickness is small.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If the fracture is indeed in the two parts, then make it similar to that: and proceed with its restoration on the day when it was broken, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after seven or ten days at most, during calm weather.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the edge of the nose with a piece of linen cloth if it has broken in one part, or two pieces if it has broken in both parts: and let it be of such a thickness as to fill the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some ancient restorers would say that they pour linen cloth into butter and change it every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	Thus is not true for me, with this it is necessary that the licinus be infused into the albus, and in the dust of the grindstone.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then let go of the licinus, until the bone hardens, and the cartilage is hardened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And when a feather of an goose is at times inserted in the place of the licinus in the nose, after it has been wrapped with a soft cloth: and so it is, that it holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, and does not prevent the sick from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, make it so: and if you wish, make the licinus.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	That if it should happen that while you are operating the nose a bleeding occurs, then bind the nose with a green thing, or with a cloth soaked in rose oil, or with a little of the herb dacyilon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If it does not happen that a bleeding occurs, then it is necessary that theemplastre itself with wheat flour, and the dust of turpentine mixed with the albus.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then put on top of it a wooden stump, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If it is that the bones of the nose are broken or crushed, then it is necessary that you split them open, and remove each one with the instruments that are suitable for them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then continue with the cutting, and take care of the nose with what is suitable to ease the inflammation, and consolidate it with the emplastre that is suitable for it, or with an ointment.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If a nail appears between the nose, then it is necessary that you care for it with the licinus: and administer a tube of lead, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	For the restoration of the lower jaw, when it is broken.
Caput V.	Chapter Five:
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken and is not connected to the nail: examine then if it is a fracture of the end only, and does not break into two parts, and take care of the inner part: then the knowledge of it is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	If therefore it is a fracture of the bone in part of the right side, so that you introduce the index finger of the left hand into its mouth: likewise if the fracture is in the left mandible, then introduce the index finger of the right hand; and push with it the gibbousness of the fracture within, easily toward the exterior, with your other hand from the interior part of the bone, and with it make equal itself.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	That if the fracture of the mandible is already separated into two, then it is necessary that you provide extraction from the two parts, according to the straightness: until such time as it is possible to make equal itself.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If however it has already happened in the teeth, a jolt, or a rupture: then tighten them of which you hope that they remain with a wire of gold, or silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then put over the broken mandible ceratum.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then put over the same cloth, and put over a large wood-shave made equal: or a fragment of sole skin of equal length as the mandible.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it above, according to what was prepared for you by way of a ligature, and the application is suitable, until it is not destroyed: and order the sick person that he use peace and quietness: and provide food for his nourishment.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If however you estimate, that already something of the figure is changing by some way: then come near, and undo it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then adjust what has been disturbed from it, and plug up the hole with flour that is fine, after you have removed the ceratum: and put over the plug wool that is soft.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While therefore that attachedplug of wool remains over it, and the disposition of the bone is not altered, discharge him, do not undo it, until it is healed: or tighten the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	This fracture is often tightened for seven times.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	That if meanwhile a hot swelling happens: then administer to it what we said often in the sedative of it, until it moves that swelling.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with the ulna, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	I have seen a fragment separated from the bone, or cut with a chisel: then do you carefully in this case, so that you remove these fragments of chisel with what is proper to you in their removal from instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If the opening of the wound is narrow, then increase it by means of the phlebotome according to the quantity of your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you remove these chisels, and there remains nothing of them, then close the wound if it is wide: and if not, put over it those strips that are suitable for it, and let it heal by infiltration, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	Regarding the restoration of the fork, when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Many things are broken from the front part of the shoulder, and the fracture of this is done in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it is broken and separated into two, except that they happen to be in her chisel: and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or otherwise, that they happen on the chisel bone: and it is more difficult to restore it.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or else, that is the fracture with the ulna.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in it when the fracture is without the ulna, is, that you may have these two ministers, so that one of them holds a support following the broken fork, and the other extends the neck towards the back side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then make the fracture of your fingers equal, so that it may take its shape, according to what is required: and do not let it be prominent, or irregular.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	That if you can tolerate a greater extension, then it is necessary that you place under a pillow a sphere made of cloth or wool: and let the size of it be according to the quantity of your need: and extend it, and tighten the fork, and press the sphere with your hand, until the fracture is equal, according to what is required.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	That if you cannot draw the end of the fork towards the outside: for this reason, because it reaches to the inside: then it is necessary that it lies down on its cheek: and place under its shoulder a sphere of wool of the right size, and press its minister who is at the bottom, until he raises the bone of the fork which is in the inside to the top: and then correct the fracture, and make it equal with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel a satahium from the furcula and it is painful: then you should find it on top of that, and with ease take out the satahium itself with your fingers.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is stuck in a bone, then you should prepare the incision with one of the incisories that you prepared for it, after you have placed under the furcula an instrument that will lift up the sifah: and this instrument is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is joined to a cochlea which is not cut short.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width is according to that by which you feel comfortable with the size of the bone and its length.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length also depends on what is possible for you to operate.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it has two ends, as you see: and one end is wide, and the other end is narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If, however, the injury that you made when you took out the bone fragment is wide, and if it is secure from the warm apomictic liquid: then you should join the two sides of the wound together with a stitch.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the injury is small, or if you are afraid of the warm apomictic liquid: then you should fill the wound with wool and powder according to the amount of the wound that has been cut.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If, however, the warm apomictic liquid occurs: then you should pour on the wool a rosin oil, and vinegar, and wine, and set it down on top of it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The stricture of the bone is when it is without a wound, and without a cut, it is, as you should place on the bone a paste made of ground flour with white chalk.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And set a wood block on top of it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a ball under its tip, if you can tolerate it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take up a wheel which the Saracens hold, which is long and wide: and its width should be that of a palm, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place on the wood block a doubled powder, and a paste.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a star-shaped frame from a thin board, whose width is three fingers wide and whose length is also similar.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the cloth and the frame together with the healing herbs at the site of the fracture and place.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the healing herbs over the fracture as a bandage, and wrap it around his neck, and under his chin, healthy and sick on both sides: and see if it does not hold the fracture tightly as it descends: and this is so that it is not hidden from you, and all, so that it does not move the star from above the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this, it should be so that you see the sick one every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever you see the ligaments have loosened, then adjust the star and tighten the ligaments.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place a soothing ointment on his back, and under his chin, a mild ointment near his sleep, so that when he turns over it helps him from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	So the fracture in the arm is healed through elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arms to his neck: and do not loosen the ligaments unless there is an accident from a fall or from hitting something until it has been twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then anoint with oil if you see the face towards that place.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the tightness, and let him go, until it is restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And this fracture in the arm is tightened and healed after fifty days: and sometimes it takes a little longer in some people.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	The restoration of a fractured spatula.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	Rarely does the spatula break, and not wide enough on the inside: and it does not break from it unless the edge is narrow.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	But when it breaks from one side and not wide enough on the inside, and cannot be known unless felt: then, according to the shape of the fracture, prepare the treatment.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And shape me according to the natural form with all the skill you possess, which is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place the powder to be ground with albus (milk), and the wooden stick, and place the cloth over it.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place on it the flat board from a thin sheet according to the quantity of the spoon of all, or larger or smaller a little.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If the powder is placed under the board at all in some places of the spoon, then make it even with the smooth wood until the board comes down according to the equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then brush on top with long-lasting glue, pressing firmly against the board until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the binding every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	As often as you can, when the glue is softened, tighten it up and make the board even if it moves from its place: and let the sick lie on the side of the healthy one.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spoon is restored after twenty or twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When then this number is completed, then undo the binding: and you are secure.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For this same is made from bones whose connection is not feared, nor is their release.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	But if it proceeds from a bone fragment, and pierces under the skin: then cut it on top of it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do as I said in the fracture of the fork from sitting in a hot bath, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	The restoration of a broken breastbone.
Caput VIII.	ChAPTER VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breastbone sometimes breaks in the middle, and this rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its ends are broken most often, and they decay from its injuries.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When it breaks in the middle, which inclines to the lower part, and causes a severe pain, difficulty in breathing, and perhaps a cough up of blood, and the break is evident in the bone, and does not隠れ
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders and gather the ribs from both sides or from the sides with the hands: and subtilize in his equilibrium, according to all ways that it is possible to do so and agree, until he returns the figure of the bones, according to what is necessary.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then put over him a plaster and a bandage, and put over the bandage a board of thin wood, or of calinger, and of similar things in lightness, after you have laid it with oil.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then subtilize in binding him over the broken bone, that it may not move: and push with the binding according to its roundness to his back sometimes, and tighten him by means of a tight bandage.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the binding at every hour, and whenever it becomes soft, tighten it: and if needful it prompts to its solution at pruritus, or to corruption which has come about in that place, or to pain, or to swelling: then approach, and solve it, and eradicate the plaster, and rectify what has happened with regard to the cure of it.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the plaster, if you see to that face: and fasten him with a bandage, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	De restoration of ribs, when they break.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You should know that the fracture of ribs does not occur, unless in the large places which follow the back, and from the extremities of them from the anterior part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not happen to them any abrasion, except through this, because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of it does not hide from the sense in the inquiry with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And the restoration of it is made so, that an even fracture with fingers according to all ways that are possible, until it is even in figure, according to what is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then put on the plaster and tighten the broken bone with the bandage, if he does not like that.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of ribs has occurred to its inner part: then it happens to a sick person a severe pain, and a pricking, such as that which occurred to him who had pleurisy: for the bone pricks with pain, and also it happens to him that there is difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and much spitting of blood: and this is a difficult cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And also the ancients have been clever with many devices: and from them are those who say, that you set meat for the sick which generate inflammation and vomiting, so that the belly is inflamed, and is extended, and drives the fracture to the externals.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	But we certainly despise, that it should not be made quickly for making a warm poultice, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if it has already happened, then add it into it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: Let it be placed on a swollen place, and then suck with strength, and it is more similar to the reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	But they are afraid that the swollen fluid will attract supernumerary fluids to the place, because of the weakness of the disposition.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	But some of them said: It should be covered with wool which has already been submerged in hot oil: and let there be put feathers between the ribs, so that it is filled up: so that the bandage is equal when it is rolled up according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then let the sick person be cured with the cure of pleurosis from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	That if he is restrained of the sick thing, which he does not bear, and the mouth stings by piercing with the awl, hurting the sick: then let us fear for the sick: then it should be, that we should split on the spot, and detect from the rib the broken.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us put over it an instrument which preserves the sifac, of whose memory came first: and let us pierce the mouth with ease, and let us pierce the same.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then let us gather together two lips of the wound, if it is large with a suture: and let us cure him with plasters, until he is healed up.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	That if it should happen while a warm poultice is placed, then let it come close, and pour feathers in rose oil, and put over the spot: and let the sick person be cured with that which suits the poultice.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	In the meantime also it is raised up on the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed up.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	¶ On the restoration of fractures of the spine and neck.
Caput X.	De restauratione fractanae spondylia dorsi et colli.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Of the restoration of a fracture of the spine and neck. Of the bones of the neck, too, a fracture sometimes occurs and rarely happens to them [the bones] when they are worn away: likewise to the spinal bones.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	Now, if such a thing happens to anyone and you want to know whether it will heal or not, then wait.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, and numb, and dead: and cannot be moved or extended or pressed together, and when you press them with your fingers and prick them with an acorn, he feels nothing, and does not feel pain in them: then know that it will not heal, and is fatal in many ways.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	That if he moves them and feels the sensation of touch and pain when pricked: then know that the bones of his neck are healed, and that the sick will recover with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	That if it is similar to the back bones and you want to know whether it will heal or not, then observe his feet: then if you see that they are softened, and what happens to his hands also happens to them: then when he lies on his back, he moves his legs and body without volition: and when he turns over on his stomach, he moves his body and legs without volition: and when he turns over on his back again, and wants to drink, and cannot: then know that it is fatal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	So do not attempt to heal it.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	But if nothing of this happens to him, the matter is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment that comes from this is, to put a little red oil on the spine so as not to be dry: or like when you wipe off sweat.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place it on top of that sometimes in the day, until he is completely well; then place it on a support that comforts and dries out, and binds it tightly to that: and instruct the sick person to use it quietly and calmly.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	Do not let him sleep over the part where he feels pain until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If it happens that there is a fracture of the bone or anything that has already become separated from it: then you should, so as not to damage the flesh, make a cut and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then take two edges of the wound, if it is large, with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for himself with some ointment, from unguentium, until he is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If the fracture is at the end of a bone that is bent outward, and there is an end to it: then you should, with the thumb of your left hand, push against the broken bone by the hand that can do so best, and with the second hand, equating it as much as possible.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then put something on top of it, and take it off: and care for the wound with the cure that preceded it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	The restoration of the ankle.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Bone rarely break in the ankles.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they break, then their fracture is not, unless there is a splitting at the ends of them: and they split in length, and turn toward the inside: and it happens that there is pain in the place, and a piercing pain: and the shin bone splits when it breaks.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration of it is such that you extend your hand over it, until you stand on top of the fracture, which is as in this figure.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at the ends of it, then make it equal, as it were, by preparing it for you from equating, until it resembles its natural figure.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If, however, the fracture is in length, or has already turned toward the inside: then let the sick person lie on his back, until you prepare for him the restoration of his fracture.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have made it equal, put a plaster on top of it: then put an wooden or leather board over it: and tighten with a strap, so as not to allow the fracture to move, nor to remove the board.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And he made them equal in size when he filled them, until they were firm according to their equality: and you shall instruct the sick man to lie on his back or on his sound side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if it should happen that he has a warm swelling: then cease from extending it, and from healing it, until the warmth subsides: and put over him what he sits on, according to what preceded, and then return to healing it: and bind him as it should be.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	But if it should happen that it has a broken bone, or is fractured: extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Instructor
Caput XII.	Head II.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The assistant is that which is between the pillow and the head of the bed.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	But if it should break, then its restoration is according to two ways.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this shape, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And bind together in both ends two ligaments.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then hang it from a raised place: and let the sick man sit on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then let him put his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches the edge of its length, where there is a small piece of wood attached to it.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang it from above the person with something heavy, that he may stretch himself out for the assistant who will work on his lower part.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician shall make the doctor even, at the same time, until he stops the fracture, according to what is needed.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And the other way is that the sick man lies on his back on his pillow, and hangs his hand from his neck with a ligament.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then instruct two assistants, that one of them hold what is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other holds below him, and stretches each of them to their side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish for a stronger stretch, then bind under the fracture with a ligament, and over it with another ligament: and let each of the two assistants stretch to their sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If then a fracture is near to the extremity of the humerus, then it should be, so that one ligament is placed under the clavicle, and another below the fracture towards the femur.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And likewise if a fracture is near to the knee: then it should be, so that one ligament is placed on that spot, and over the knee itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then an equal fracture should be set with ease without work, until the time when the fracture is made equal as needed, and applied with a good application: then tighten it, if there does not occur a swelling of heat.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	But if a swelling of heat does occur, then release the tightening until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place on top of the limb a wet wool dressed in vinegar and rose oil, until the time when the swelling subsides: then tighten it: and the mode of tightening it is that you place a sponge over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then put an innovation from new cloth over the sponge.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then he will tighten his arm on top of his aid, and place his open hand on top of his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth, and tighten on top of the aid arm so that the arm remains in place: unless it prevents you from doing so, nor should anything be moved over you from the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	Which if the time comes, that something be moved over you from the broken bone, then use the blocks: and it is like to put on top of the fracture a block which is wider and stronger than the other blocks.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between all the blocks a length of finger: and let the length of the blocks be equal to the fracture with an addition of three fingers from every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tighten on top of the blocks with the tightening which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it should be, so that your tightening is tighter over the fracture spot.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture lengthens, the looser the tightening.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If then you see the lengthening of the blocks and the loosening of the tightening, as we have said, at the time when you restore the limb immediately, then do so: and if you are afraid of a swelling of heat, then release the tightening and the blocks until the seventh day, as we have also said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament for all three days, so that there is no pruritus or swelling at the site, or to prevent food from reaching the member, due to the excess rigor of the stricture.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Correct the whole thing, as we have said above.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	But if you are really confident that nothing will come from it: then don't open the ligaments, unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let him sleep on his back, with his hands on his belly; and place under the pillow a blanket full of wool, even.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of night or day, that the broken member does not open, or that the ligaments become soft.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Correct the whole thing with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And provide the nurse with food according to the order we have specified, so that there is a fine food at first, until the mouth begins to tighten; then it should be, that his food increases.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the custom of the aide and the limb is, that it be tightened for forty days; then it should be opened, and given a bath, and treated with ointment that straightens it out.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	But if the fracture is sore, ground down; then don't open from it the ligaments or the splint until fifty days, and for two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	The restoration of a fractured arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two clavicles.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of them is small; and that is what follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and that which is placed under a little from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps then one of the clavicles will break alone, or the other; and perhaps they will break both at the same time.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	But when the little clavicle breaks above, then the restoration of it is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the big clavicle breaks below, it is a bad break, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when two bones break at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If however the bone that is broken is slightly below the shoulder, then it is advisable for the doctor to approach its restoration in order to place the extension with ease until it is even.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If however the broken bone is a large one: then it is necessary that he put on a stronger splint quickly.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary that he put on the hand figure at the restoration of it and its extended extension over the little finger.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be set at a higher position than all the fingers: and let the articular inferior be set for all the fingers, or other: and let the sick sit on a square before himself, and let the little finger be in front of him, or directly behind him, in height, so that the sick person does not suffer any trouble.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then he shall extend the arm from the lower side, or with his hand, or with a ligature.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another minister shall extend from above likewise.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the doctor shall make the bone even, until he reduces it to the best shape that he can.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If however there are fractures of the bones, then you should attempt to restore every fragment to its place with your own strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If however it seems to you that there is a separation of the flesh, and it hurts the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then take hold of it on top, and remove it according to the method which we have mentioned in those which precede this.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If however there is a fracture with the ulnar bone, I have already done for it to the singular cap, so take hold of its cure from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If however it happens in the beginning of your restoration that there is a hot swelling, then take a thin cloth made of linen with a green dye, and white ash, and put it between its thickness and thinness: and tighten the cloth on the bone slightly, until he sits down: then remove the cloth, and place a prepared plaster from powdered linseed with albumen.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then put on the stars, and let there be a star that is put on the fracture itself wider by a little bit, and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of stars of the arm is six in various dispositions: whether it is a fracture in one shaft, or in two shafts together.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then put on your bandage over the place of the fracture stronger and more firm, and a little more with the bandage to the upper fracture, or to the lower part of it: or put on a softer bandage a little bit according to what precedes the memory of it at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let there be cloths that are wrapped around the fracture, soft, wet: and not be hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let there be a thread that is tied with linen of its own, middle between thin and thick, as we have described.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and the ligaments after a few days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	That if anything requires correction, which is necessary, such as a itch that happens to a limb: then it should be that the limb is immersed in hot water, until that itch quiets down, and you remove the bandage from constricting the limb, until it quiets down, and then repeat the bandage.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	That if the bandage has already softened, and the bone is a little distant, and similar things: then correct it all with your power, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, because of an excess of bandage, then it should be that the food is made a little less, and you leave it a few days, until it cures towards the food, and then tie it up.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if anything of what we have said does not happen to those who are ill, then it should not be that it is healed, unless after twenty days or so.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then hang the injured hand by its sleeve on his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let the neck be kept even, and guarded from violent motions.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And let him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And thou shalt know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days; and perchance it shall be restored in fifty-nine days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All this depends on the condition of the wound, and on the power of the healing.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	On the restoration of broken bones of the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Head XXII.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that it rarely happens that a fracture occurs in the palm of the hand or in the knuckles of the fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to him, unless it is through frequent friction.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore a fracture occurs in the sole of the foot, or through friction: then let him sit on a equal chair: and before him let there be set a second seat equal to it.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then put his hand upon it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the surgeon shall extend the bones that are broken, and shall make them equal by the medicine, until when they are joined together by a good joint.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then let him put on plaster and a splint, if it does not happen that there is a hot ecma.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then let the plaster be placed from above according to the quantity of the place: and thou hast already wrapped it with linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	But if the fracture is toward the lower part of the sole of the foot, then let him make a sphere-like shape out of linen cloth: and let him instruct the sick person to place his foot upon it with the sole that is broken: then bind it with long linen cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let him sit on a wax-like cushion, that is soft, so that the wax may come into contact with the body of the sole: and bind it, according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	But if the fracture is toward the outside, then let him place from above one plaster, and another plaster below on the sole: and let the sick person sit with his hand open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then put on a bandage, as it is extended out from the hand: and extend between the fingers with a ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	That if a fracture occurs in any of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, make it equal according to what is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then tie it with a plant: and if you love her, put on her a straight, strong splint; so that she may hold the fracture together, and not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	But if the fracture is in some of the digits, such as the middle, index, or ring, then it should be made equal and tied with the finger that follows it: or all should be tied according to their continuity: and that is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or put a splint on top of it like we have said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after that disposition put heat on it: and oppose with it whatever needs to be done, when something happens from it, according to what its narrative tells.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	De Restoration of the Fracture of the Pelvis.
Caput XV.	Head XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone often breaks and is felt: because it turns towards the inner and back parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done in such a way that the fractures are tied with ligaments above and below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the injured person extends his hand over his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then he extends all the ligaments according to equality of parts: and this is done when there is a fracture in the middle bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	But if the fracture is near the root of the pelvis, then there should be a ligament to the side of the pelvic bone so that it does not extend upwards: and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And in the same way if there is a fracture near the knee, then there should be a ligament close to the knee so that it does not extend downward: and another below the fracture.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the doctor should make both hands equal in shape to reduce the hip according to its natural figure: and the bones are joined together by a good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary that you put plaster on it and tighten it, if something has not happened to the member by apothema.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	But if something has happened to it by apothema: then let him go away for a few days, until the heat subsides: and then return to your cure.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	Strictura autem eius ita sit.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	But the scar should be so placed that it lies over the fracture of the bone, that is, bindean; and twice or thrice, and let there remain none but a little surplus.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap up the leg so that it reaches to the root of the heel bone;
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee towards the lower side, and bind the ends of the thread from the upper part of the two limbs.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then turn over the leg and thigh what surplus there is from the skin.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then put on top of the thigh at the place of fracture the bone that was broken, and put out of it one bone on to the leg bone.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill up the space between the leg and thigh with soft cloth, so as to equalize the scar.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin strong from the middle at the place of fracture by three or four inches of wrapping.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And as much as you lengthen with the bandage from the place of fracture, your scar will be smaller and softer, and milder.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then bring both ends of the thread that you inserted between thigh and leg down to their ends:
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Bind now with each of the three bones that are on top,
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then bring both ends of the thread down to the bottom, until you reach the ankle bone.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And tighten and the ends of the thread also from the other side: so that the bandage does not move out of place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then let the scar rest in this state, so that no infection, swelling or inflammation comes about, nor anything similar to them.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If something of that sort should happen.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Then bring the wound to its proper place, and make straight what has gone astray, as often as we have said before.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	But if a piece of bone that stings has gone into the bone: then it should be made even, if you can manage it.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find out under it, and move it about: and take care to remember where it was, until it heals over again.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture of the coxae is tighten, besides that they are added to him stars, as we said in the adjutorium and in the arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However in the restoration of it this fracture, does not happen an infirmity with lameness.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides that a leg of the other is applied to him, then it is necessary, that he always laments who has it, because.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And you should know that the coxa is tighten in fifty days, or added a little, or a little is made to rest: all this is according to the difference of complexions and the rest of dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	On the restoration of the fracture of the knee joint of the leg.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You should know that a fracture of the knee joint of the leg rarely happens, but it often happens to him a wear.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If, however, a fracture has happened to him, then there is only an opening or a hole in his parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is with an injury, and without an injury.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And stands completely on it with a sense of.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	The restoration of it is so that he makes up what has been broken from his parts with the fingers, until it is gathered together, and joined according to what is possible from an équation and a facility, and by manufacture.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then put a plaster from flour sisipal, or to be pounded, with egg white: and put over it a round astellan, if you can bear it: and tighten tightly the fitting that corresponds to it.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the dispositions that we have told you about in the other fractures: like an opening of heat, and its likes: so that you oppose to every accident with him that corresponds to it, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	On the restoration of a fracture of the leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You should know that there are two bones, of which one is thick and is called the femur, and another fine, and is called the fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happened in both species of fracture that happened to the two bones of the arm: and for this reason his restoration is made as the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	That if both bones break at once, the body becomes deformed in all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if one of the smaller bones breaks, the body becomes deformed towards the front.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if one of the larger bones breaks, it injures the lower part: and it is from those which do not obscure you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer the extension, and the equalization, and the tying of the bones according to that which is equal.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the body is a bad fracture, it has many problems: so that the extension is less, and the relief is milder for you.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the body itself there is an operation on the arm: and it is, as when you make the bones equal, and take up all your operation, then take two strips of pine wood, which are used in making hinges that are placed under tables: and they are made from the palm leaves: and choose from them those that have a small thickness, and there are not any of the small ones: and make their length according to the length of the body from the knee down.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap it over one piece of cloth with two wraps according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one side of the body from the one part, and the other side from the other part: and they are from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then tie the two strips in three places from the two ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	Since, however, the tightening is forbidden, the body leans to the right and to the left, and remains in good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now the joint is already administered from wood according to the length of the body, and it is placed in it so that it conserves itself from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And many things must be done, so that you make it in the fracture when it is a proper wound of its own kind.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the wound on every day, and study with it that last effort from apoplexy, or inflammation, or other remains.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore anything of these happens, then oppose it to him with what is necessary, until he is healed, if God will.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of the fracture of the bones of the foot and fingers.
Caput XVIII.	Head 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	The heel, however, does not occur a fracture within.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	Of the bones of the foot does indeed happen when there is a fracture, and of the fingers little also happens when there is a fracture: but they do not happen to them unless there is wear and tear in many ways.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	That if there is a fracture of the bones of the foot, and these bones are seen to separate from each other, then let the sick man put his foot on the ground prepared, as one who walks.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand you, and put your foot on that which rises from those bones: then press, or trample on it: and make it even, until it comes back to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then put a plaster over it, and a cloth from above: and put under the foot a flat board which has two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then tighten it with the foot when you are walking, after you have wound it with rags, and with anything else with which it needs to be bound up.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	But when three or four days have passed by, then loosen the ligaments.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones even if they are fractured or displaced.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation then is as you see it.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if any of the fingers are broken, then restore them, and make even the others according to what you have told me about restoring the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then put your finger on a splint according to the length of the finger, and make it a little broader: then place under the foot this board which you have told me about, and tighten it with a firm fastening while you are walking.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	But if indeed what is broken are two or three or more bones, then place over each finger a splint of its own size, wound up in a cloth: and tighten the board under the foot: and stand, holding the board with one head under the foot, so that it remains by a good hold.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting that you not forget, but that you consider all that I have said to you in regard to the remaining fractures from accidents which we have spoken of: and oppose every accident with what is required.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Regarding the fracture of the woman's shoulder, and of the pelvis, and of the male's thigh-bone.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the woman's shoulder is fractured, then let her sit in a square position.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her towards the back of herself, and let her be held from behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife shall fill the woman'e hollow with her hand, until she is filled: and let her be made roundly with the hand from that side.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman shall be shaken, and her back shall be raised gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	That hand which has been placed within her, let it come out before the woman' door as a sphere, and the broken bone shall return.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a pillow upon her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When she wishes to urinate, then let the hand come out easily, and then let her urinate: and reduce it according to the manner in which you first placed it: and then let it return to its pillow.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let it be done for seven days, or about that, for the bone itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a piece of wax and twist it upon a hole of the woman' peg, and insert the whole wax into her:
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow with force into the hole, until the wax is bent within the woman' peg, for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then let it be filled with her hand, and stand a few days, according to what we have said, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the man' peg-bone is fractured, or that of a woman, then administer to its restoration, and to its equalling that which we have described in regard to the bones of the neck.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And let not the right eye be hidden in those close fractures which occur little, especially where there is some study, or use.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book well, for itself signifies to you in many dispositions a straight way in the restoration of your own, and a constriction of its own: therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	And in the staff of man when it is broken, take the throat of the goose: and introduce the staff into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then put over him the bandage, and let him be wrapped up, and let him be for three days, or about them, and he will be healed, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	Of the restoration of broken bones, when it is with an injury.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It belongs to him who has suffered a fracture with an injury, especially if it is great, such as the hip bone, or auxiliary, or similar to it, as you see fit, and let him stand immediately: if you attest the conditions of phlebotomy, as we have said before.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	That if the bone spills blood, then you should, as you see fit, cut off it, so that it powderizes on top of it: if there is not present another to you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture in him on the same day: and do not put off it, if there is no apostema.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	But if a poultice becomes hot, then dismiss the restoration of him until the ninth day, until it subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach him on the third and fourth days at all, for you would make bad accidents happen to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	But if a bone is broken and stands out above the skin that has been detected: then you should, so that you seek to reduce it, and make it equal with your hands with ease and small extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	But if it is not prepared for the extension of it, and its equality with your hands: then reduce it with a wisp of hay.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And this is an instrument that is made of iron, whose length is the quantity of seven fingers, or eight; and its width is according to the quantity of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for this necessity is there a doctor, so that he may take from them three, or four according to the quantity, which he needs for healing of any kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And it shall be round; and there shall be a little grossness therein, that it may not double itself under pressure upon itself at the hour of the operation: and its acute extremity, which shall have an edge on its extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let it be above that grossness from half of it to the lower ones.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary that, in this operation, the acute extremity be placed with care upon the prominent extremity of the bone: and push it forward with a single movement, until when the bone returns and reaches some degree of equilibrium.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore consider to make the extremities of the fracture face one another in a straight line.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the extremities of its fracture are slight, and does not take it well by means of an instrument, then you must, that you push on the extremity of its bone, until when the instrument can have power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If you cannot reduce them at all by means that we have described, then push it on with care from the incisions which we have said: or cut it with one of the saws in any way that is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then saw off what remains in the bone from sharpness and small grooves.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When, therefore, the bone has been reduced and finds after its reduction a painful swelling that hurts it, you should know that the bone has not returned to its own place.
Fac ergo illud.	Make it then.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you have a great power of injury when you complete the restoration that you are making to the bones.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then submerge the cloth in a black stipping wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place over the bone any poultice, nor anything wherein there is oil: that it may not happen to him a putrefaction and corruption.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer herbs in the hour of your supplement to the restoration of the bones.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And let go of the bone that is caught: so that you push it with tweezers in the second wound according to the quantity of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And for every precaution, do not tighten the bone with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many often made this stupidity of doctors; and did happen to their patients or death, or corruption, or putrefaction, that is, health.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And be your ligature soft, mild, various of the ligatures of other broken bones.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	That if the bone is bad, or is a great bone, and you wait on the top of it some bad incident which we have spoken of, and suspend pain in the place: then it is not fit that you should put stars on the top of it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make for them poultices from tough革in the place of the stars, and tighten the bone with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When then is it one day old, or two days, and you see the bone already begin to putrefy, that it generates pus: then remove from off the bone the poultice which you put on it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer poultices, and unguents wherewith we are accustomed of our custom to heal the injuries: such as the unguent of four medicines, and other like it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And comes to you, that you should loosen the ligature.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And observe the bone every day, both morning and evening, until it is consolidated, and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And let the limb be prepared so that pus may run from it to the lower parts with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	That if the days pass over many wounds and are not consolidated, nor does the pus run away from it: then you shall know that there are little bones in it.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Why it is fit that you should inquire about the bone which you touch.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of those bones are separated, take them away, and draw them out.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And which of those bones are not separated, and pinch the limb, and make it hurt, try to put it, and remove it in any way that you can do it to thee.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	That if it happens to the wound to swell up or break out, that is, to suppurate, or some other species of corruption and putrefaction: then you shall oppose each one of them with that which comes to it after the healing: whose prece essit narrazione in his suo.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from this in which it is necessary that my speech should stand, and which you are to apply to your present mind when the bone is broken, and it comes out over the limb, like the hip-bone, and assistants, and similar things from large limbs, i.e., so as not to suspect its attraction, for often death has happened from it, besides leaving it, until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	For perhaps it will fall of itself after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then therefore take care of the wound if it remains with you; and if not, leave it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	Regarding the treatment of a fracture in the jaw.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This surgery has often been applied to the healing of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially that which is near joints: and it should be fed from that figure of the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it forbids the limb from its natural action.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Consider therefore then, if the surgery is recent: administer to it medicines which have a drying effect, such as aloe, and olive oil, and myrrh, and wood-black, and acacia, and similar things.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Thus, that you may take from these certain ones, or all of them: and bind them together with astringent wine, or with egg-white, or with vinegar: and place them over the surgery in a poultice, and bind them tightly over the good constriction.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the constriction alone, and do not remove it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then remove it, and again apply another one, until the surgery has healed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind it over with a lead strip of uneven thickness.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	Lead is a property which takes away from the limb whatever it fears.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the fracture has already joined with the bone, and is firm, and the need to remove it is urgent: then find on its upper part, and cut off the excessive with a sharp instrument: or saw it off with some rasps, until it comes out: and take care of it, until it has healed.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	When cure is made after a disease has left a member remaining which does not suit its natural place.
Caput XXII.	Chaps.XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a fracture of the bones is healed and yet the member remains short, it is done for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One reason is the multitude of ligamentious solutions and the non-conformity of its ligation; or because of the superabundance of stricture of the ligaments, until alimentation is prevented from running into the member: or because of the multitude of emulsion which is superfluous at a wrong time; or because of the scarcity of blood in the body, and the weakness of it.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And its cure is, to feed the sick and to make the member strong, until the blood multiplies in it.
Et administra balneum.	And to give it a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and cheerfulness into him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then put a poultice on the member, that it may attract to itself much alimentation.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And give him frequent emulsion with warm water, until the alimentation runs, and return him to his natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	On the healing of broken bones when they are healed out of their due place.
Caput XXIII.	Chaps.XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that a member is restored after its healing, and yet there is a deformity of the bone or a movement; and food is given through the opening, though the member itself does not prevent from performing its natural function: then it is not necessary to take issue with what it exists, that one should break the member again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have been many stolid doctors and restorers who made this in our country.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	This operation is most dangerous, leading to death, or great fear, as it appears to be mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the claudication and movement are recent: then it is necessary that they be given emulsion with warm water, in which are boiled soft leaves, such as of aloe, and its root, and mealy-mouthed onion, and similar things.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let him make for himself a plaster with a soft plaster, like that of the decussate darts.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or let him take a mucilage of aloe roots and mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil, and let him plaster himself with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or let them take young fig branches and wrap them in columbine clay, and similar things that are called as medicines that soften the konsolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when the neck has been freed with persistent massaging, the old, soft one, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And let the member move in all directions during all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the tortuosity has already preceded and become strong, and is embedded in a stone, and provokes the need for its treatment with an iron: then it should be, that the upper part of it be cut off, and the continuation of the bone be healed, and what surplus is from the tortuosity or the bone with subtle incisors be removed: and ease should be given to him with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On the treatment of dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of some joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Why it is restrained from its own motion, and is supported in its figure.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And does occur to the pains of the weak, and the painful wounds.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	So when a dislocation occurs, then it is necessary to hurry to its restoration: and it should not be delayed at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place will be postponed, and there may be a reduction of the dislocation with it.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore it should not be moved, nor should it be extended in the hour of its postponement.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because it often causes a spasm, and painful wounds.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when this happens, then you should, in order to prepare for the phlebotomy of the sick.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then it is dismissed, until it rests after the postponement.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the member is anointed with hot water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then reduce it with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And heal every limb with that which reminds it of its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have already arranged the chapters on dislocations and also, with regard to what preceded, from the upper part of the body to the lower.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	§ On the Treatment of a Dislocated Mandible (lower jaw).
Caput XXV.	CHAPTER XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws are rarely dislocated unless by some rare chance...
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	and the dislocation of the upper jaw takes place in only one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or, indeed, do they move away from their places by a slight distance and become slightly looser.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or, they are dislocated completely and fully until they become looser towards the breast, until the saliva of the wound flows, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and the tongue of him wiggles with a lisp.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When, however, the dislocation is slight, then it returns to its place by itself with little difficulty.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If, however, the dislocation is complete and full: then it should be administered a reduction quickly, and there should be no delay; and it is as if one holds the jaw at its root with a finger: and the doctor should insert his hand with the thumb of one of his hands between the mouth of the dislocated jaw on the side of the dislocation.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or, if the dislocation is from both sides, then insert two fingers at once.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And let the remaining fingers of his hand be outside, with which he will even out.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And order the sick person to clean his jaws and to be able to chew on all sides.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And let the doctor adjust the jaw and push it back to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If it is difficult to reduce it, especially if both jaws are dislocated together: then administer a steam bath with warm water and oil until the reduction of the upper jaw becomes easy: and do not delay the reduction of the upper jaw at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When therefore they are brought together and the bone is closed and do not swell: then put on them pieces of cloth, with a wax that has been made from wax: and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then bind it together with ease using soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the sleep be upon his back: and his head be between two pieces of cloth so that it does not move to the right or to the left: nor does it twitch, or want to chew anything: but his food is given to him softly, until when the pain has gone away, and his jaw has been set in motion: then he eats what he wants, and gives it to him with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He does not sweat over the operation of his mouth when he is eating and drinking, and when he is swallowing, until his jaw has been set in motion and has healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of the two jaws is difficult when they dislocate at some time, and do not return to their places: then many times fever comes from there, and frequent farts: and perhaps the stomach becomes unhealthy, and perhaps pure cholesterol is expelled.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	So when you see this: then know that it is a loss, and many times that person dies who has had this for ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the reduction of the dislocation of the Fork and the extremity of the arm.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI. On the head.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The fork does not dislocate from the inside due to the continuity with the spine.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it dislocates sometimes towards the outside: and announces itself to the sense.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is, that he lies sick on his back, and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then bind with a strong hand the place where you bound, for it will return by itself.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then put on it waddings and cloths, and tighten it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities of him who lies on his side, and continue with him, do not dislocate unless they are rarely displaced.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it dislocates on one day: then let it be reduced and equated according to what we have said, and let it be prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place over it a plaster, and pus, and a strapping.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the sick person to adhere to tranquility and quietness until healing takes place.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same cure, when the limb of the humerus is reduced and separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	[¶ On the Reduction of a Dislocation of the Humerus.]
Caput XXVII.	CHAPTER XXII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	You should know that the humerus is not dislocated except by three means.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is so that it is dislocated toward the soft part toward the lower side.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is so that it is dislocated toward the side of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is dislocated upward on the humerus, and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	 Nor is it dislocated at the back because of the spatula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	Nor is it dislocated in front because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	Indeed, most often it is dislocated and moved downward toward the soft part; especially in those who have little flesh.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it moves quickly in them, and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those who have a lot of flesh, on the contrary, it moves and enters slowly.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some people that there is a rupture or fall, and the humerus is dislocated by heat; and it is supposed that this happens because it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, you should know this thing, until you are sure of its truth; and then proceed to the cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And recognize the dislocation when it is toward the lower side toward the soft part; and distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For there is a marked difference between them; and when the neck of the humerus is bent, and under the soft part near the touch of the head of the humerus it seems to be almost the same as itself: and the sick person cannot reduce his hand to its place, nor move it in all its movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And likewise, if it is dislocated opposite the breast, or upward: then the injury is manifest to the touch, and is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And of this dislocation, the reduction is easily done when it is recent, or when the person is a boy.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is as if he raises his hand towards the upper part.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then put your fingers under its nipple, and raise the suture with force towards the top to its place; and the minister will lift his hand, and extend it upward.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then let him put it down, for he himself will quickly turn over.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If he does not turn over by that which we have said, and there are several days since the dislocation happened: then it is necessary that the sick person bathes himself in warm water, and an ointment which softens and soothes, as if it were cooked aleae roots, and foenugraecum, and melilotum in aqua, and is administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the sick person should lie down on his back; and a sphere and wool, which is equal to the length of the suture, should be placed under its nipple, which lengthens and relaxes it.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the doctor should place his heel over the sphere, and with force should lift the head of the humerus, and draw the nurse's hand towards the lower part.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another minister should hold the nurse's head so that it does not move towards the lower part: for he himself will quickly turn over.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you want to reduce it according to this way: and that is as you make a man who is longer ill stand by the side, and let him put his shoulder under the nipple of the nurse: and lift the nipple towards the top, until the sick person hangs in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	Then another minister should hold the nurse's hand at the lower part of his thigh.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If the sick person is lighter: then it is necessary that he is suspended with something else, so that it supports him: for the dislocation turns over immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	It is also reduced according to another method: and that is, as it is laid out on the ground a long piece of wood whose head is round figure: like the hand of the mortar: which is neither thick nor fine.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then place under the patient after they are placed on top of the head of wood a thin cloth: and the sick stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then extend his hand on the lower part of the other part, and extend his body with force from one side: for the joint returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	That if his reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this care: and that is, take a piece of wood whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width is the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness is the quantity of two fingers: whose head is round, so as to alleviate his entrance into the deep ticklish, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then bind over the head a thin cloth to the wood does not hurt the sick.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then place under the ticklish patient to extend hand, or arm on the wood until the lower part: and bind the wood to assistant and arm and extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then place arm over steps by width, and extend hand to the lower part, and let go of the remaining body suspended from one side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the joint enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When the entrance is then completed according to any possible way: then you should put under the ticklish ball of equal quantity of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place a prepared plaster from ground flour with frankincense, and albite over the whole shoulder, as it turns upside down.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tighten under the ticklish with a tightening descending: and turn back on the joint over the plaster upside down: and attach his hand to his neck, and let go, and do not move his hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that the sick patient is placed food poor in nutrition until he is comforted the limb: for it is faster to his recovery.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then let it be kept for a longer time, after seven days or five, and let it be examined with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	But if it hardens and does not soften, then he is completely healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	But if the joint dislocates frequently, because of the moisture that occurs with it, or because of some other cause: then he should administer to it a caustic with three perforations, as was stated in the chapter on caustics.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	That if this is done completely, and the ligament is made to heal after seven days, and the dislocation does not return, and the sprain and stricture over it are occasionally loosened, and does not harden, and falls, and cannot raise itself up towards the upper arm: then know that the nerves which are in the shoulder joint have already been cut, or stretched out, or softened. And know that the dislocation will never return to its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	But the dislocation that occurs towards the breast and the nipple, or the rear reduction, occurs with an impact and extension with the hands: until it comes back, and a remaining sprain and care is administered to it, until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	That if anything happens after healing with weight on the limb, and a delay in its movement: then let the sick person frequently use the bath until that weight is softened, and return it to its natural state first.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	**On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Elbow.**
Caput XXVIII.	Caput XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the elbow joint dislocates with difficulty, and also returns with difficulty, and that it itself dislocates to all parts, especially to the front or back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation does not hide itself from you: for it falls with a sound, and with a touch, according to whichever way it dislocates.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join a dislocated bed with a healthy one, it becomes clear to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	The dislocation is tight, and the arm cannot be bent, nor can it be touched with its shoulder.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	It is fitting that you should set about reducing the dislocation immediately, before warm aposteme occurs.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if it happens that warm aposteme occurs, it is difficult to reduce it; and one would certainly not heal at all, especially when it is in the rear.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse for all kinds of dislocation, and more painful to them; and often death goes down with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it when it is out of them which can be reduced, is as if he extend his hands with both hands: and his arm sit extended, and his medical hands are above the bed and under it, and he pushes the splint with his thumbs of his hands simultaneously, or with the root of his palm, until he returns to his place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or else the dislocation is to the front: then he returns as if he double his hand with his hand, until he hits the bed which is dislocated at the root of his palm.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	Which if it does not comply with the dislocation to reduce, then administer a painful stretch, strong and hot; and it is as if two ministers extend the arm: and they hold him too, so that he does not move during the stretch.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm turns back to all parts after it is turned over a long fold of cloth on his hand, or a wide ligament.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches with his medical hand the joint, he lubries it with oil; so that it is out of them which help in lubricant of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he pushes the joint with a painful push, until he returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after reducing it, it is fitting that a plaster be placed on it, in which sits the stain, and drying with white of egg; and be tightened by a tightening going down.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And hang the arm from the neck of the nurse: and let go after a few days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then unpick it.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	Which if he is fixed in its joint in its place, then unpick the ligaments from her, and let go herself.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see that the wound is not well sutured, then apply a second plaster, and a ligature, and leave it for a few days until it heals.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then remove it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If, however, he becomes heavier after the reduction of the suture, and movement is felt: then administer humidification in a bath, and gentle friction, and compression, until the bandage, or put on an ileum, that is, put on the weight of a sheep's fat.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then bind it with a ligature, and leave it for a day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and introduce him into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When he sweats then, apply friction on the suture with a moderate force.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then apply one more layer of fat, and then a second, and a third, when entering the bath, until it softens.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if there is a wound: put on top of it manure made from sheep dung, moist, heated with butter, and bind over the wound.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Make it a few times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	The wound will heal, and return to its normal state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	This is the chapter on treatment of dislocations by Albucasis.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The hand often dislocates, that is, the wound between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of this dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	On the contrary, the dislocations in the other joints are more difficult.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that the speed be in the reduction of this dislocation at the time when it happens, before the joint is measured: or happen there an accident of heat.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of this dislocation is such, that you put the weak hand of Mahassem on a table, and extend its thumb, and let the doctor place his palm on the eminence of the wound, and push it back, until it comes back into place.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider that the palm has gone back to the thumb of the hand: then put the sick thumb of the hand on a table when extending and reducing it: and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the thumb of the hand, then the position of the hand should be placed inside the table, that is, the inner part of the hand placed on the table, so that the doctor's thumb falls on the eminence of the wound.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If then he returns at once, it is good: and if not, then tie him up with a plaster while the apostema subsides: and let him go, and do not return to that.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if he does not bear it, and you are unable to relieve his pain, after a few days, however, the wound remains closed according to its own shape: and it does no harm to the sick man, unless his hand becomes soft, and he is unable to grip anything: then you should know that the nerves have been torn away, or worn down.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is therefore no skill in it, unless it is tied up with a plaster near to his danger.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not bring anything.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	So then if Almahassem does not return, then place a plaster on him, which we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then tie him up, and let him go for five days: then unfasten it and let him go, and exercise his hands.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	But if his movement is restricted, and something heavy happens to it: then make it soft with hot water and occasional rubbing, until it softens.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	The treatment of dislocation of fingers.
Caput XXX.	CHAPTER XIII.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated completely from its socket, or from the back of the palm, or by the wind up, then extend the finger and push against the dislocation with your thumb, until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the end of the finger, and suspend it towards the side to which it is dislocated, and let him go for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend him, and extend him, until he becomes straight again in his own day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	So then when it is night, bind him up according to his story: and do not cease to wash him in the day: and exercise him with movement: and bind him up at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Let him have some days, until he is tied up.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And also do the same with him if he is dislocated at the wrist of the hand: and tie him to the side, and do your work with him, until he heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do likewise with it when it is dislocated to the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	When curing a dislocated spine.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to anyone that there is a dislocation of the spine or of the neck, and many joints are removed from their places: then there is no cure for this, because death approaches the sick.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And a sign of this is that his waste-matter leaves him without volition, and he cannot hold it: and often from it some limb of his, or two of his legs, or two of his arms, or one of them, is made feeble; or one of the joints of his body is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For this reason, it often happens that it is removed from its place, because it often happens that it is removed on all four sides.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	That which is removed to the back is called a hunchback.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	But the cure for this is, that you should consider then, if a hunchback happens to occur from youth: then there is no cure for it, and no health at all comes from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in that which has occurred from accident or strike or similar things, the ancient method of cure with a long speech I have already said.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Whom most does not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I have, however, shortened it from that, for whose little excuse is far from his nearness to my intention: and I presented it by way of explanation, and formed an instrument out of it in various ways from him by which they showed it, and presented it itself.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say, that in the hunchback which has occurred from the front part, there is no skill, nor health comes from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And likewise in that which happens on both sides to the back.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And they are not cured of these, unless that which happens in the back with its own story is told by me: and it is that he should lie on his face on an equal platform next to the wall: and spread out under him a damp cloth so as not to hurt his chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then let a straight and solid piece of wood be placed in the foal in the ground, at the end of his foot, about his head: and let another piece of wood be placed about his feet on the other side of his foot: and let the assistant hold the wood, so that it does not stand firm in the foal.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And let the assistant hold the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then let the nurse bend over his head and with soft lint fasten it firmly: and extend the end of the ligament to the wood that is at his head: and bind him there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then let another ligament be tightened above his thighs, and above his knees, and at his ankles.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then let all the ligaments be gathered together, and bind them to the other wood that is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then let the assistant extend to the two pieces of wood, and do not remove them from their places, as we have said: but they must not be firm, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	Then the doctor shall place his palms on the board with strength, until he has stopped: or let him place it on a board.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then let him attach his feet to the board, until he has stopped.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	But if he does not stop by this cure, then take a board whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And make a hole in the wall where we have said, which is near the sick man: let the end of the board come into that hole.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board on the wood.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	Then let the doctor place his feet at the end of the other side.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And tie it well, until the board is tight: and let him return to his own place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with a tourniquet that is wound up with your hand: and it is like this, to fix on the ground at the end of the sick man's foot two pieces of wood whose length is about one arm: and at his head in the end of his other foot two pieces of wood.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	Then let the length that is between all the wood be one palm: and it has been made in every place a hole, in which the tourniquet runs: and let all the wood be firm on the ground, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And a round piece of wood is inserted; and it is a turning in which the ligament turns in two holes of two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the end thereof is a hole, in which the wood is fixed, whose length is a palm with it that turns; and in two other pieces of wood there is also like it.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the ligature which you have tied inside the chest on the turning that is at the head of it; and the ligatures which you have tied on the legs of him on the turning that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand by every turning where the surgeon turns his hand with a lever, with which he turns the turning: and the doctor equit Spondylem, according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the turning, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then, when you have returned the Spondylus and equated the place, then you should put on an dried plaster with albumen.
Deinde stuppam.	Then the stasis.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then put upon the plaster a panel from a board, whose breadth is three fingers wide, or about them.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is such a quantity as it takes up the space of the Gibbosity, and on the healthy side of the Spondylus.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then let it be tied with the ligature which we have said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the sick one be fed with thin food, until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	That if anything remains of a eminence in the place at the end of the Sanation: then you should, when you administer the medicine which softened, and relax it, with the administration of the board which we have said at a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now is administered in that leaden plate.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when it happens that a eminence has come to the last Spondylus of the back: and it is supposed by this dislocation, and it is that opening which it already emits.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Why it should not be put in him with this medicine: for if perhaps will happen to make death with it:
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	Of the Cure of a Dislocated Ankle.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that the shoulder joints and the elbow joints do not occur unless there is a dislocation; and they do not occur among the other joints because of a small distance and closeness.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the shoulder joint dislocates according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Since it dislocates forward and backward.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And it dislocates a lot to the inside; and a little to the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of this dislocation to the inside is: because when you tie a healthy leg with an invalid, it is longer; and his knee bone protrudes more than the healthy one, and the invalid cannot double his foot there, and there is a place that follows the hip joint, which is hot, so that the head of the thigh has reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of him to whom this dislocation occurs on the outside is that his symptoms are opposite to these symptoms.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of him to whom this dislocation occurs on the front is that he expands a healthy leg according to the complement: nevertheless, he does not double himself without pain in his knee; and if he tries to walk, he cannot step forward: and he holds his urine back, and his hip joint goes outside, and when he walks, he steps on his heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of him to whom this dislocation occurs on the back is that he does not expand his knee, and cannot double himself without bending his hip; and his leg is also shorter than the other one: and his hip joint is softened, and the head of the thigh has reached its place.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this dislocation is as follows: consider then, if the dislocation has healed, that it has been reduced with the one who has it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer a reduction of it and remains according to its position: then it is not at all in this treatment.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore it should not be assumed that it has been completely healed.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In that, however, whose dislocation is recent, and it is of one of the four species of dislocation: then approach to this, as you wish to tie, and extend it to the interiors and exteriors, and move it with the right and left hand: perhaps it will return, and does not need any other care.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	But if this does not return in this way, then you should prepare a strong tool, and extend his leg from the lower part: or with his hands, or with a ligament that is tied over his leg above the knee: and another minister extends his hand from above, so that he puts his hands under his toes.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then it should be tied with a soft ligament over the root of the pelvis, and the end of the other ligament should be held.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And it should be extended from the front part of the groin to the hip, or from the back to the spine.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And all these movements should be made at once, so that the sick person rises with his body from the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	This is indeed a common type of movement among the four types of dislocation.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If this returns with that which I have mentioned, it is good: and if not, then each of these things that I say about the self-care of the disease is necessary.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In reducing, however, when the dislocation is towards the interiors, it should be that the sick person lies on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then put a ligament over the root of the pelvis, in the place that is between the head of the hip and the place that is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligament towards the top from the part of the groin to the higher part of the body, to the hip.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong minister takes his arms, and narrows the large place of the sick hip, and extends it towards the exteriors with a sharp extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now he has returned to his place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this type is easier than the other types of cure, when this member is reduced in this way.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If, however, an excuse is found against you, and he does not obey you at all in this kind of cure: then it should be so that two feet are bound together with a strong ligature, soft and above the two heels and above the two knees: and let the length of each from its compeer be the quantity of four fingers: and let the leg be extended which is injured by the other quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the sick one should be hung on the head of the tree, which is in the house: and let the length of him from the earth be the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then order a strong youth to support the hip: and let another be hung with the sick one: and let another push him strongly, for the ligature returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In return, however, if there is a dislocation to the outside, it should be so that he lies on his back, according to what we said before when he has a gibbosity.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And a ligature should be tied above his leg, the sick one himself, and above his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two logs should be placed, one at his feet, and another at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a log should be placed in the middle of the foot, firmly fixed: and let there be placed there wet cloths so that they do not hurt the sick one: and let the log be between his hips so that it does not pull towards the bottom with the extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then all the servants should extend themselves on their side, and the doctor should make the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If then he obeys to the return, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place him on that table, and press him, as we said before in the case of gibbosity, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it should be so that the sick one lies on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it should be so that the leg of the sick one is extended quickly: and this also we told about on his back: and let the doctor place his right hand palm on the thigh of the sick one.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then put on a splint with your free hand, and with that very splint place the splint extended to the lower side of the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the back: then it is not appropriate that the sick person be extended to the lower side and be raised up on the ground, but it is appropriate that he be placed on a hard thing, as we also said when we spoke of his lying on two broad things: and it is on his face, and the extensive ligaments: according to what we have just said.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is appropriate that compression be administered with a board also to the place from which the joint has come out, when reduction has been completed in accordance with what needs to be done.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of his return should not be hidden from you: and is it that you extend the two legs of the nurses: and when you see them equal, and the sick one tightens his leg, and expands himself without excuse: then you shall know that the limb has returned, in accordance with what needs to be done: then you unite the two hips, and put a splint, and tighten it with an imamatum, that is to say, a rotator: so that it does not move the width to any part of: and the sick one should stick to quiet for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the ligaments, and the splint, and compare the legs together: then if you see them equal in state, then know that the dislocation has already been fixed: so let the sick one go about walking.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening: then return, and put a splint on it, and tighten it according to your first tightening: and let go of it also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen it and let the person walk a little on each side for several days, until he is comfortably healed.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	De dislocationis genuis:
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter LIII. On the dislocations of the knee-joint.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee may be dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It may be dislocated to the outside, to the inside, and to the bottom, that is to say, to the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it does not dislocate to the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you instruct the sick person to apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	But if it does not adhere to the hip: then you should know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all modes of dislocation is so that you make the sick person sit upright, so that he can stretch his leg over it if he can, and fasten his back to his face: and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then adhere the knee of him with your palms, and make them straight between your fingers above his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm the two sides of his knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another minister should stretch out his foot, until he brings back the knee to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of reduction is that the leg adheres to the hip with ease, not with effort.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then you should set him, and make the leg adhere to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with a bandage of twisted strips for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then remove them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And do not let the sick person walk for a few days, until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	But if you do not reduce his dislocation, then administer a strong extension with the ligaments, of which the following account was given in the cure of ankylosis, until he is healed.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	The Cure of Dislocation of the Heel Bone
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel bone is sometimes moved by a slight movement, and sometimes dislocated from the second order of complementariness.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation takes place either towards the inside or towards the outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel bone swollen, proceeding to the side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	But the cure of its movement is easy to reduce; and that is, that it is stretched with ease by the hands, and made straight, until it is healed.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	When he is to be treated, then if it is a dislocation according to the complement, it is necessary that you make the sick sit upright: and let him hold himself by a strong minister tightly from the posterior part of his back, in the middle of him.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then you take with your right hand the foot of him from the upper part, and with your left hand at the lower part of the foot place the nail.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then you draw the foot toward yourself with the right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with two fingers of your left hand.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with your left, and push the chest of the foot with the right toward the thigh without labor.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice, as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the chest of the foot toward the thigh in a third force, and you draw the nail.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If then he returns in a force one or two according to this mode, and you see the foot even, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation over him: for he will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if it is forbidden to you to reduce him with that which we have said: then let the sick one lie on his back on the ground, and fasten a piece of cloth firmly into the ground, so that it falls between his knees: and you may now lay upon him the cloth, so that he be not hurt.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the minister take the thigh of the sick one: then extends the other foot, with hands or with a band that binds on the top of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let all the ministers extend against the extension of their own, and let the nurse stand between the two knees holding him back so that his body does not attract toward the lower part by the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the doctor makes even the dislocation with his hands, and the other minister holds the sound thigh from below.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore the dislocation returns, and you declare to him that the return of it is good: then let you put a cloth and a pad, and fasten it with strong bands, and bind the foot to the thigh with a band firmly tying.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	It is appropriate that you do not fear or hesitate concerning the nerves which are behind the heel bone in the back, lest they be injured and cause pain.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then release him for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the ligament is softened, tighten it; but if it is tight, loosen it. But prevent the sick one from walking for forty days, or even five.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If, however, he attempts to walk before that space has healed, there will be no security without first dissolving the dislocation, allowing it to heal properly, and avoiding any further injury.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If, however, he has a fever: then you should administer to him in sedative the remedy we mentioned elsewhere in the context of treatment, and rub it on until it is gone.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Regarding dislocation of the toes and their treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter LXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is appropriate that you allow it to heal with a little stretching without work: and this is not difficult, indeed, it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If, however, the dislocation is in some of the nerves at the back of the foot: then you should make the sick person's foot stand on an equal piece of ground or on a table, and it will be like walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then stand still, and place your foot on that which protrudes from the joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then, with your foot, press down on it firmly until it bends back into place, and you will no longer see any prominence in that spot, and the joint will seem even.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under his foot a board which supports the whole foot, having two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then tighten him up with three days' restriction of movement.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then release him, and let him rest from walking for many days, until he is well-tightened and secure after the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	Regarding the appearances of dislocation with a broken bone.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter LXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something like this happens to him, and he desires a cure and restoration, many times death succeeds: and therefore it is not appropriate, that you should be too hasty in his treatment, which is of this kind, unless you are prudent in the art of long-term use, merciful, compassionate, slow, not daring, and not presumptuous: and that you use only those medicines which settle the heat of fever: and leave to God's discretion the sick person.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	If you are not hopeful of recovery from destruction with gentleness of sickness, and if it appears that there is some hope,
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Then prepare to reduce its amount immediately at the beginning of the disease before it happens that a feverish blister occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	But if the limb returns [to health] according to our wish, then administer a regimen that quiets the blister: and care for the wound with it when it suits him from the dried ointment.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	That if a dislocation is with fracture, and it happens in the bone of separated fractures, then try to remove them, and do in that what we said in simple illnesses from [the fact] that it preceded in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And be careful according to your ability, and guard yourself from the entrance into a state of fear: according to my prediction for you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting to your glory, and healthier to your body with them in your time.
