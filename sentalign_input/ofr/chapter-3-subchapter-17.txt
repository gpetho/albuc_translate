of the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle there is no fracture, but in the bones of the foot sometimes there is a fracture and in the toes a little, and there rarely occurs more than a simple fracture in several places.
And if there is a fracture in the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overlapping each other, have the patient put his foot on the ground, as if he wanted to walk, and then immediately put your foot on his, where the bones are raised, then press it until they return to their places;
then put the plaster and padding on it, and place under the arch of the foot a small board with two flat ends, then tie it to the leg appropriately, after you have wrapped cloths around it, and other things that you need.
And when three or four days have passed, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones even, whether they are broken or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are broken, set them as we have described for the fingers of the hand;
then put on the broken toe a splint along the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider, then place under the foot that board which I mentioned, and tie it appropriately;
and if there are two or three, or more, broken, put on each toe a splint according to its size, wrapped in a linen cloth, and tie the board under the foot;
and it should extend over the end of the board beyond the arch of the foot, so that it holds it well.
And you must not forget the other things that I have mentioned for other fractures, from what we have said;
and treat each incident as appropriate.
