On the Excision of the Clitoris and Excess Flesh Protruding from Women's Genitalia.	On cutting the clitoris and fleshy growths in the female genitalia.	0.7165396
The clitoris sometimes increases in size beyond the natural state, so that its appearance becomes unpleasant and ugly. And it may enlarge in some women until it spreads out like men's, and becomes suitable for intercourse.	The clitoris may grow in size above the order of nature so that it gets a horrible deformed appearance; in some women it becomes erect like the male organ and attains to coitus.	0.84451497
It is necessary that you grasp the excess of the clitoris with your hand or with a hook and cut it. Do not go deep in cutting, especially at the root of it, lest bleeding occurs.	You must grasp the growth with your hand or a hook and cut it off. Do not cut too deeply, especially at the root of the growth, lest haemorrhage occur.	0.84532195
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds until it heals. As for the protruding flesh, it is flesh that grows at the mouth of the womb until it fills it.	Then apply the usual dressing for wounds until it is healed.	0.4716024
And sometimes it protrudes outward like a tail. Therefore some of the ancients called this ailment "the tail disease." So it is necessary that you cut it just as you cut the clitoris and treat it until it heals.	As to the fleshy growth, that is, flesh growing in the cervix and filling it, and also often protruding like a tail (on which account some of the Ancients called it 'caudate disease'); this too you should cut away as you do for the clitoris, and dress until healed.	0.6801709
