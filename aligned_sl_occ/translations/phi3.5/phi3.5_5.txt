And now you have completed this book of medicine which is at the end of scientific knowledge for me, due to your understanding as conveyed through lectures and statements from you, showing that you comprehend fully this treatise on surgery I've dedicated myself to studying.
When the operation is restrained in our region and at all times, until I am restored by its science; but only some small descriptions are found freely among ancient texts, which I change to correct these errors and clarify intentions—thus limiting my knowledge to what'dicted herein.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "And I have seen that you understand this tractate in accordance with its second part of exposure and declaration, as well as for the addition of cauterizing tools and other instruments needed for the work at hand; which is necessary.
May be the reason why no one dares to use a tool on their own body in our times, for medicine has become long and complicated, requiring extensive knowledge of anatomy as Guiliel knows about the proper parts and forms of these bodies; including bones, nerves, muscles (lacertz), names of those things, and spaces within them where blood circulates actively or rests quietly.
Through Aqua Ypocrates' guidance which is also the name of this work, mainly in matters concerning health (or medicine).
May we already have discussed this matter in the entrance of our free time; who does not know what we've told them about anatomy, will fall into error and become dead if they see only parts of these things, which are formed within this science and taken from its knowledge and experiments.

And you have already entered this book for the second time through these three chapters.

When you determine the quality of that cauterization and where it is forbidden to use such treatment,
So say that the discourse of cautery and its obscurity is long and elaborate, using subtlety in science; they speak much about it extensively, disagreeing among themselves, and for me just a part suffices due to prolonged discussion.
And so it is said that the cautery comforts all of the body universally, except for two complexes which are parts of its matter. (The term "cauteries" refers to instruments used by medieval physicians for various treatments such as setting bones or stopping bleeding. The text implies a holistic approach in treating pain and injuries where cautery is applied broadly across the body, with exceptions made only for two specific complexes—likely referring to areas that are not directly affected
In the dried and humid parts of matter (likely referring to body tissues), we separate them; those who find relief apply their instruments there, while others go against it because such treatment is not appropriate for illnesses characterized by both moisture and dryness—since these are qualities inherent in fire's nature. Thus, the necessity arises that dampened (humid) and seared (dried with heat from a cautery or similar means of application) parts be healed; this is necessary because they represent both moisture and dryness—qualities innate to water itself which makes such illnesses inconvenient.
Here comes the sentence for translation: "Discover that which speaks against it, which through cautery is greatly beneficial in all dry madness tail and body pains where men experience them when comparing a man' extrinsic humors with those of himself at the focus point.

When in other complexities, it is not out of fear but mainly due to damp and cold humors, all doctors are agreed upon treating these issues with caution during the procedure involving such instruments (cauterization).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May the medicine' extricate reach that individual in their limb where it has lodged, and forcefully draw out into the diseased member difficult to heal and swiftly withdraw.
May the focus (medical attention), through its sublimity and substance of goodness, does not excessively consume resources; for we have come to know it thanks to experiments and long periods of servitude in studying this art concerning truth about causes; thus excusing us from lengthy discourse. At this pause within our conversation, I shall share with you the secret manipulation at the focus (the specific medical intervention), whose quality is demonstrated through surgical procedures on limbs and expulsion methods for diseases—all of which are philosophically proven arguments presented herein to enlighten your minds.
And wise ones know that it is best at which time one should perform cauterizations and rest periods in the early morning of first day.

So do not press on your feet or hips, for they are only valued by the common people and ignorant physicians; as a result, curing this illness through cauterization cannot be completed at once, causing delay in treatment.

It doesn't hurt much nor greatly weaken muscle tissue; therefore, perform another cautery quickly on this joint. Return that over his head for cauterization inside while the intestine is divided (presumably during surgery or treatment). Cut the neck and reveal the bone quantity that we have recorded and cauterize it in the back part of the head where it is being called upon to act, which is also the place where a bellows-like device (ventoscope) has been placed.

When the head or joint pain becomes severe in a game of chess (or any activity), and when this deep aching occurs inside one's bones/joints, it is time for doctors who specialize in internal medicine to come into play; they will prescribe an immediate cure as stated in their texts on diseases. Moreover, without proper treatment which includes both urgent intervention with medication or surgical procedures (depicted here by the knight and rooks), nothing else can be done—cauterization is performed using two methods: either a swift curative medicine for acute conditions involving combustion-like inflammations, or through the use of iron.

When you treat an ancient antidote for wounds and divisions of diseases, do not neglect the treatment prescribed by medicine or cauterization at the focus point; apply it within that long line wherein lies its mark—the place of pain we are discussing here. Place your hand firmly upon this area to ensure you reach deep into the injury site via puncture marks created with a needle, guiding healing fluids back up through these entry points using fingers pressed against them during application for an extended period within strikes made by arcing implements (possibly referring metaphorically or conceptually rather than utilizing actual tools).

Cauterization of a mouth ulcer or fistula is likely what this line refers to in the context of treating such a condition historically:
When addressing an ulcer or fistula in the uvula, palate, or teeth (which has decayed and is becoming loose), you must first cover it with gauze as required for that area's healing process; afterward apply a cauterizing torch according to how much there seems necessary on the ulcer. Place this flame wherein lies the fistula, so your hand can be within reach while allowing enough time (typically one or two days) until fiery metal enters and breaks through at that spot; during which period you must observe it attentively to prevent further harm as directed in these instructions for treatment.
So if the illness is cured and health returns to you, be content; but if not, then it's necessary to discover wherein lies decayed bone and hold firmly according as each comes forth in its turn within his skull.

When the veins are softened by moisture and the teeth become decayed; treat those with medicine, but do not apply it directly here on top of the head where the waist meets the belly below the chest, then heat that very same cautery which is about to be applied so that you can pause its application over the tongue and insert into this hot implement while your hand holds tight therein; thus ensuring warmth from the fire source at the tip of the tongue spreads downward.
Return your hand (your lap), and repeat some of the cautions as you wish/need.

From "cauterization of tooth pain":
When tooth pain is due to inflammation or a cold within the body, and it does not respond well to medicine treatment, then apply poultices on those two areas as second measures: an application of warmth at cow' extrications (likely meaning near calf muscles), or direct heat.
Cautions are those by which you grasp the border of cows and barrels within the forge'thy workbench, placing a clamp on its extremity where pain festins as if inflamed; similarly secure that very same edge with borders secured together, keeping it over the area experiencing agony to prevent further swelling.
Return the intestine or hernia back into its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from protruding again until the heat of the fever subsides in the head (i.dictorium).
If you wish, submerge wool or cloth under there above it, and place that upon the sore tooth, whereby the red-hot iron will reach the cavity of the affected tooth.
Even when the cauterization is at the heart (the central point), you attend to the swelling or redness in the body'dict, and ensure that it does not reach the mouth of the malady.
Return the shape of the instrument to where it will come, and apply heat over its tip while you keep your hand inside so that the cautery becomes hot; this may be applied several times when the pain is heightened or in that day or another.
When that instrument (cauterizer) used by the malady opens its mouth of good boundary and holds it for an hour, then this is how the treatment with said instrument goes on.
When you cut or remove as much as is within your power, that's when cutting should be done according to what can be achieved by yourself.

Keep burning at intervals until reaching the ulcer'thy base—that is where treatment progresses if ingested remedies are also used, ensuring they arrive in time for healing before potential worsening or complications such as ossification (prepon del apostema).

From the given context of medieval medical texts with influences from Latin, Italian,
Of gout and joint pain treatment.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And when gout is healed by the medicinal treatment and not left with residual pains, then apply bandages or poultices as appropriate to alleviate discomforts.
When you are caustering that which is expulsion in the circulatory loop of the joint between the foot and leg, with proper burning tools (cauterization).
That is the form of this tool: (referred here as 'olive wood') a heated lancet used for treatment.
If it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then use a pointed cautery for that purpose. If pains penetrate into the abdomen or other joints, and motion causes them distress, it is necessary to apply a lancet on any of those spots with three or four lancing instruments from this very same cautery for relief.
If you need more lancets that these are necessary for use, then apply the one needed without pressing too hard with your hand on them previously used; do this only to send out (possibly implying removal or testing) the contents of the bladder.
If pain enters into both legs, then apply the treatment we have mentioned earlier on their chest (head).
If the pains are only in the limbs alone, and it is called suppuration (indicating inflammation or abscess formation), then a point shall be made on the circuit of the fevered vessels following their circulatory route along these two lines.
If there are remaining pains in the joints, then points will be made on the circumference of each node and around the painful area (of the body).
If joint or muscle pain comes upon the legs during certain days, then they will perform cautery on all parts of their attendants.

When there is a break in the bones and cauterization of the wound with boiled clay applied to the navel, thus you command that malady release its sustenance within itself today using gentle causes so as not for it to perforate one's stomach." This line suggests an ancient remedy involving applying heat (boiling) and specific location of treatment on a wound with clay or similar substances. The intention is likely focused on internal healing where the body, through these interventions, would be prompted to repair its own tissues without causing additional harm such as perforating within itself – possibly referring to damage inside the stomach region associated with fractures and wounds at that time in history.
Here it goes: Follow the malady between your thighs on top of yourself and order that they hold their breath so that a hernia or protrusion appears (or an intestinal bulge).

When chronic pain in the limbs persists due to intervention or palpation by a healer and does not alleviate with traditional medicine, it is suggested that one should resort to localized application of points for relief through burning (cauterization).
When using caustics for all body parts according to their magnitude and smallness, as well as the state of health and torture or pain experienced by them, take into account:
So if it is healed by the first application of cautery, then be; but if not, continue to apply on him these points for members directed towards the urinary organ in order that subsequent applications of cautery may lead to its healing within this malady.

If leprosy has already spread over the thigh and appears manifestly, then you must cauterize that part with these cautery tools which we have in our possession; at this point also use a cauterium on the extremity of the nose, two cauteriums each for their small mouths/anus (mouth), two cauteriums upon two vertebrae of the backbone, and various cauteriums corresponding to those parts: one large over some intervertebral discs, another over the chest; also apply two on joints, two on muscles belonging to your limbs' bones; furthermore place them twice each for hands (both palms), once per foot arches and toe-pads, double cauteriums upon both ankles/ankle pads, one over various finger joints, another at any knuckle of the hand. Then you must apply these tools to all articulations in your limbs as well as on each foot sole (sole).
Guard your nerves that are above the ankle so they do not burn these.
Some treatments involve cauterization on the bones of the jaw and in other places such as the mouth of the stomach or the genitals.

When the patient experiences pain and moves their head while lying down (presumably for treatment or examination), it is then necessary to perform a circular cauterization on that spot as they turn in bed, presumably relieving discomfort associated with an issue within the neck area.

This line describes an extended wound care process aimed at complete healing by removing scar tissue ("scaras") entirely, leaving no sign of decay. In this medieval context where modern antiseptics were unknown, the use of oil might serve as both a cleansing agent and dressing material to prevent infection while promoting repair.

For the treatment of breathing problems caused by a wound through surgical incision with a scalpel (or perhaps "arcsidia," which could be interpreted as some form of cutting instrument used during an operation). The sentence suggests that
When troops avoid the breath caused by an incision made with a scalpel (interpreted as "arceria"), you must either perform further incisions on your patient or use cauterization instruments for their limb(s), and then it becomes difficult to restore that. The sentence advises healthcare providers, likely medieval barbers-surgeies of the time who were trained both in healing (as physicians) and surgical procedures (often associated with soldiers due to battlefield injuries): if they do not immediately treat an open wound which interrupts breathing ("fluex"), it is challenging, perhaps even unfeasible,
Therefore when you apply heat to the patient's chest where their breathing is affected by an injury from a surgical instrument like scalpels (referred here as "arceria"), place your hand over that spot until the wound-induced difficulty in breath ("fluex") ceases and does not resume. The guidance suggests maintaining contact with the healing site to ensure recovery, prevent complications such as pus formation or airway obstruction (often associated with untreated chest injuries), especially after heat application which is believed at this time in history to promote blood flow and possibly aid wound repair by stimulating circulation ("motas veguadas" implies ongoing care, "endic estrenh aquel motas") until the breathing difficulty resolves.

The sentence appears to discuss alternative treatments for specific ailments, possibly referencing bloodletting or other historical medical practices that were thought effective before modern medicine established more evidence-based approaches.

Thus when you wish to incise that part where the malady resides in its chest and flare up with scorching heat at said location—applying pressure on top of a hot cloth forsooth prevents arteries from surfacing, securing tightly across the patient's upper torso; also consider how to apply it around veins where these vessels might be visible near areas already targeted by incisions.

The line instructs on the method of applying heat as an immediate measure, possibly for reducing swelling or relieving pain at specific points identified by incisions. It emphasizes careful consideration when dealing not just directly over arteries but also around veins—and it is expected that such delicate procedures would be performed only upon direct supervision ("en alcus homes").

When ancient acute or catarral conditions in temple structures arise due to moisture and the quality of stones within those sacred buildings, such as old foundations that resemble them likewise, these ailments are soothed by our medicinal herbs; thus we find ourselves suffering from these maladies necessitating extraction or cauterization—as demonstrated.
The pain of the operation and extraction from those humors which are in the sanctuaries; understand that arthritis is shown on your pulse as it appears therein—it remains hidden only when quickly moving homeward due to excess humor flowing within (the patient'thy body).

Regarding the treatment of sharp and acute pain in joints caused by excess humors or imbalances within them, as described here:
When the acidic humors accumulate there, they rest on those veins which are above the chest bone and do not cause any discomfort for healing in medicine; at times their face turns red as if ambulating like ants, and their hairs become frizzy due to tear fluid evaporation. Ancient apothecaries attend these patients diligently during this operation, trimming the scalp (as they would do with lice), scraping off dandruff caused by lacrimation; thus completing that healing intervention today.

When arteries are clogged and circulation continues to occur within them, at times the humors of phlegm become overextended, leading to a situation where not only eyelids with ulcers but also hair can be affected by these pus-laden elements. This results in an acute pain around the head so intense and deep that it extends beyond even close proximity; hence we understand through this knowledge of accidents caused directly from blockages within the blood vessels stemming from their divisions, whereby both humors (body fluids) and catharsis/cleansing must be addressed promptly.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:

The entire cause for water in the hands can be one of four kinds: It may either resemble iron or lead (fer and veyre), it could also involve plant matter such as chickpeas or broad beans (ceze or fava)—or alternatively, this might signify fluidity akin to mercury combined with vinegar and other substances related herein. Or else, it may stem from the miasma of an animal in question.
And when blood flows out of the ear or appears similar to those causes that do not fit into it and stops in the ears, if you see the flow, then administer its removal, and make them stretch their bodies as necessary for expulsion, paying special attention to patients who have aversion towards treatment. Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Apply pressure in the circulatory system of some wool or linen pads and extend the artery towards the parts above it; these movements are directed here due to this cause.
If not alleviated, then apply gentle manual extraction using the instruments referred to here as the act described thusly.

And if there is nothing left to account for all the causes we have discussed, then grasp what remains so that it may heal by cupping or convulsion.
When the malady of such that you sanctioned in this way involves unclogging and extracting from within the vein called sephasica, along with its second segment according to the virtue'dictum (or guideline) here laid out, it is necessary for your hand to intervene between yours and convert any cracks present on the horny part into a small fissure there. When the figure of the moon'se crack reaches the stone (the treatment area), and if that stone is softened with an appropriate instrument at hand, then close the crack therewith as quickly as possible to heal it within this moment.
If the cause is cholesteral in the gallbladder and inflates therein, then treatment and extraction will be administered; however, if you do not obey medical advice, apply a gentle heat under this form: e administers that which was extracted from his gall bladder, into this aperture (or wound) where it has been cut open.
When you do not make it wet when you think that it has already been moistened by the aurelha'se vapor, and pause there in drops, so as to prevent those from leaking out or seeping underneath (their skin), for they are being drawn away here with us.
May it enter the water where the malady uses sternutation to relieve its condition, and completes filling the earlobe with warm drops, and pours them over that part of the ear in which the water enters; if through this method relief is found, then be contented (that's "es bo," satisfied); otherwise, take fine pebbles or small stones according to its length, place it at the tip of your finger held by a patient who will insert and thrust one stone into their own earlobe as they hop on that particular piece placed there. So that all water enters through the pelvis.
So that all water enters through the pelvis. And when the water rises at the gate and you take hold of paper or cloth, stretch one end over here where it will ignite the liver inside.
Even more medicinal oil and water are used in such a way that all the liquid is drained out through the extraction needle inserted from below.
When an animal enters through that hole, if it is a small creature and appears to come out of the body itself (the womb), let them pull it out gently; otherwise, when it's from a large one causing pain in the uterus, then apply gentle extraction methods using forceps or hooks, removing its cause while being mindful that this is separate from all other causes found within the hole.
May pain from the extraction of worms be born in the artery when you heal that which we have spoken about in terms of division and flow during distillation, provided you do not comfort your cure but rather observe the artery towards the sunlight.
So if there appears any cause of worms here, extract that with gentle hands or fingers, perhaps not needed as long; but in the absence of such a reason, take an old catheter drawn up and out below this way—this is how it'dict. Here the delicate extremity enters into the armpit according to the quantity that may suffer from the malady; and apply suction therein with great force, making flowing movements until all worms are expelled through their holes (holes).
May you not obey my instructions, then you will bleed and seal in the channel of the catheter with wax as we have already done; administer these same remedies that were previously used against parasites within their treatment channels.
And your infusion is where you dissolve these medical substances in the golden vessel, which is this very tool. E for that one of silver or lead is struck quickly in which there's a small splinter, and it is placed under the patient's arm.
So it is necessary when they press in the continence of the catheter here at this place. If you wish, take the sponge and wrap it around the patient's limb gently, placing oil or honey (or any of these remedies from our medicine in a syringe – and that is where the needle goes) into the cavity of breathing, or juice/essence derived from some herbs; place the needle above and below this area so that as you compress it quickly inside, the oil (or essence) will be expelled within the cavity of respiration while making the melancholy feel its application.
When it is infused into the artery, then it has already been cut and set on the small focus (probably referring to an incision or wound).

This discharge that occurs in the eyelid is necessarily called blepharitis; and it has its own nature, either inherent or incidental.
May it be caused by vermin or cracking or through caustic interventions, or other similar occurrences.
The way of the operation is that you take a needle in which makes double thread, and keep it on the flesh; making the thread pass from the right tear (lacrimal) into the left tear (lacrimal), until the thread reaches the extremities of the body.

So that location is consolidated and good flesh has grown in its place, free from disease and abscess for forty days, without renewal of wound or scabbing occurring therein; when you know this, it means healing has occurred.
If not, it is in no way within the body but to reduce the crack to its shape of the nose; according to this methodology: and when you discover two metals or acute medicine (presumably referring to surgical instruments made from metal like scalpels or other sharp tools used for medical purposes), upon finding them, take it as such form:

This illness, referred to as "alconatia," is not simply any disease; rather, it'mistakenly refers to an affliction that resembles drowning and seems different in nature from what might be expected of such symptoms. It appears this condition was perhaps thought to involve some aspect or confusion related to water (possibly through wetness on the skin) without actually being literal submersion into a body of
This statement seems to describe an unusual practice for dealing with the 'alconatia,' wherein one must pour water over a device (possibly some form of medical apparatus or bathing aid) and then press their own head onto both hands, dry it off completely so that no moisture remains, effectively sealing away any remaining dampness. By doing this meticulously with each hand while observing the parts for signs of illness returning (possibly as a symptomatic relapse), they believe to prevent further complications and keep out drafts or 'air,' which might worsen their condition, allowing them instead only light ('lum') exposure. Here's an attempt at translation:

When in the nose various pains are born from these adjusted carrion pieces for which there is no cause leading to scorpions or polyps, it is called Polypus; this malady bears a resemblance to that of such creatures depicted." Here, medieval texts often connected nasal discomfort and physical symptoms with curses or supernatural causes. The reference seems almost like an allegorical representation linking the suffering from conditions in the nose (like polyps) to mythological entities ("scorpions" being arachnids known for their sting), emphasizing a belief that health issues could be interpreted as punishment rather than purely medical phenomena, which would nowadlausely require clinical And from the meat comes blackened (or dark) substance and here it is that flesh should not be of a brownish hue." This line further delves into concerns about dietary sources contributing to ill health, implying an association between consuming certain types of decayed or discolored foods ("blackening" suggests spoilage
Therefore in that which you place within your body (presumably referring to the consumed meat), if it is not fraudulent or blackened and rotting flesh, then open a hole between your thighs so as to expose them both for sunlight exposure. Feed their extremities with these meats." This instruction from medieval medical literature provides guidance on how one might attempt self-treatment by using the body’s natural processes (like basking in sunlight and feeding oneself) rather than relying solely on external interventions, which aligns with humoral theories prevalent at that time. This suggests an approach where exposure to light is believed beneficial for health—a concept somewhat Extract that from the parts above where it is understood as a thin bone under which all the flesh remains; if there'dict any cause of loss in here, then extract water using one of the subtle instruments available to facilitate addressing this possible reason for detachment within. If you have the leather or accidental boil for a sear tool ready, then stop what comes from within; and if it's an abscess of malign nature, apply pressure to where flesh has separated and all cavities are present.

If the moisture does not penetrate secondly that covers, you will understand that within this body there is no flesh in the feet where it has not reached by absorption.

The sentence further delves into the specifics of how these humoral imbalances manifest within different body sections or parts (likely referring to areas where joint pain may be felt), suggesting an empirical
The translated sentence details different localizations of symptoms caused by acidos within the body, distinguishing between cap and belly (where apatemyxia may occur at distinct anatomical sites): The head has its own form of sudden onset aphasia ('apostema accident'), which is separate from abdominal 'aphasia' or confusion. Furthermore, carpal swelling due to acidos differentiates itself as well – whether in the joint (indicating arthritis) versus at junctures/joints ('locs en les quals accides'). The latter part of this line suggests that these are matters for operation; medical procedures or surgery may be required. Here, 'operacio' likely refers to both diagnostic and therapeutic interventions within
When some points are made that have not yet been fully developed in the sickness, and at these places of their complements or limbs, translate as follows:
So other apastes that are dislocated when crossed and do not mature according to their function, similar to those at joints, which become established within the course of fluids in the body cavity, corrupting the ligaments or nerves of that joint; if you delay perforation beyond its ripening stage towards the main member, it will then rupture into this already ripe state and damage; but no foreign object pierced here causes indigestion completion. Rather, it is one related to the abdomen (belly), so when penetrated in an underripe condition, its elongation occurs along the divisions of the intestine therein, forming a fistula or pain within that region which will not heal on its own. May you know the time of the puncture for the abscess and so it is when it ripens.
E understand that it matures when the pain subsides and fever ceases; reduce the intensity of coughing and pulsation, strengthen the head affected by apendicitis, and improve other symptoms.
When you know where the entry point of abscess and incoming pus from treatment for elevation is,
Perforation is for the length of the flesh or body, if splinters are in the parts of the masses or feet, and in locations where no reflection occurs; this procedure is used wherever reflections occur according to that part.
May it be when the abscess is in the flesh, then we must pierce through him until his digestion as confirmed by its second complementation, which allows us to have what we need; but if you puncture that area now, the patient' extrusion of pus and foul discharge will extend beyond this place, causing duress on their lips and increasing in depth.
May one make an incision according to the body's structure or where it is necessary due to what part of the body requires intervention.

May it not be possible for someone who cannot bear with surface lions' nails or shallow punctures that you make on the skin; they will only penetrate at most to this level (surface).
And when the abscess is large and has collected harmful pus, do not attempt to extract all of it at once; remove some from that spot today, restore the wound tomorrow with a larger piece removed yesterday, continue removing small amounts as directed until full healing occurs. (Assuming "apostema" refers to an abscess or infection site.)

Watch this chapter with great caution, and place your incision there where you pierce these thorns; be sure to avoid infections, and consider whether the worm of the thorn is scant or flat, then administer whatsothy/their medicine or ancient remedies accordingly; if it's large, with fissures on your incision sites, cover each area where these cracks have come.
If in the abscess there has been detachment of part of the colon or that area has become concave within its circuit, then cover it with a tight cloth wound dressing as soon as you have applied bandages or gauze pads; and keep moisturizing this until tomorrow.

If you continue the flow of blood, then take care to administer the prescribed medicines and powders in these places mentioned herein for treatment.
In case of winter, and the location of abscess is a place where nerves are stressed, then cover it with powder made from vine leaves and oil bandages, placing them on top of these locations.

This sentence continues the discussion in Old Occitan about effusion (which may refer to inflammation or swelling associated with fever and pain). The translation into English would be: "Then you say that hotness and fever are due to excessive overflow; once sedated, this bubbling dissipates. When the fever subsides along with agony and warmth, decay stops." In a medieval medical context, practitioners may have believed in humoral theory where an imbalance of bodily fluids (humors) could cause illnesses such as inflammation or pain – here potentially linked to
This final statement from the Old Occitan text translates into English as: "And it may not be related to heat or fever nor pain; this is where that lion's heart lies, which belongs there." Here 'node no es caliditat ni febre ni dolor,' likely refers back to a specific sympt
In English: "And according to the color of its complexion and his consumption (or what he takes in), it may be either a cold or feverish condition; these are considered as two spices or fats, which contain moisture, whereby humidity colors themselves." Here 'color de la corpos' likely refers to both the visible signs of illness and underlying bodily fluids believed by medieval physicians. The sentence suggests that a person’s complexion (or skin color) can indicate their health status, while what they consume could affect this condition either way—either as something beneficial or harmful ('specias' suggesting medicinal spices). This aligns with the humoral theory prevalent in medieval medicine where observing external signs and one’s diet was crucial for

In the capital of inflammation caused by twisting of nerves—here begins the ailment that Ayssi suffers; it appears as if she has an inflammatory condition in her shoulder and vein(s), possibly indicative of irritated or compressed nerves, especially since these symptoms occur upon percussion (tapping) or from excessive straining. The reference to "seemingly" suggests that the observed signs may not be definitively diagnosed but rather strongly suggest a specific issue with her nervous system in those areas implied by physical examination techniques
It is found that Ayssi's painful pains are located in the hands of her assistants or feet, or anywhere where joint discomfort has worsened—this indicates potential issues with these regions which may contribute to our understanding of her symptoms and their origin.

Regarding nurturing or care for the navel area, it can be translated as: "Concerning the care
The eminence of the navel is affected by motions or cracks on its surface that are present over other ruptures; this may be due to blood flow from a vein or artery as mentioned hereafter, or because it's constrained and thus winded. The original text appears to discuss possible causes for pain in the navel area which could include issues like fluid accumulation (blood) resulting from cracks on its surface that might occur due to other ruptures nearby; this can be further complicated by restricted blood flow, possibly caused by a blockage or narrowing ("coartation").
If there is a tear in the cistern and rupture of the fabric, then the color of the ulceration resembles that of the body; it hurts like a lion, appearing from various situations. If it is due to the discharge of the intestine, then you have noted that which we counted earlier today, with great variability in intensity; when this has occurred and your patient's condition becomes apparent, return now; so quickly as possible, lavate their abdomen vigorously.
May it be for moisture, I (the physician) will not hide myself when near your hand, nor constrain you, nor make a pact with you.

If it is due to windiness, then touching of him/her (the patient) becomes a lion.

Then command whoever is between those hands to stand opposite each other across from one another over said position held by hand pressure, encircle around this spot with spinal splint (a type of medical restraint), and hold tightly onto that which lies below these joints where ligaments are located; also maintain the treated appendage within its circuit using either a strong rope or chain, along with your own strength.

If you wish to do so, place the needles and insert them into where it pierces the extended flesh, then incise that part when it is subtle and inserts itself, placing care for what comes out of the wax within which it becomes healed.
If the navel's prominence is due to fleshlessness or moisture in it, then you must address this swelling as quickly as possible and extract dirt and humidity from it, which causes discomfort there, taking care of whatever comes out at that time.

So it is said that ancient ones did not perform circumcision on free men, nor use them for their laws, and only obtain these when they try through experimentation. This causes the loss of a large part of artisans and barbarians who practice circumcision with new tools made from bone and ligature using the glue produced by flies' feet; and they apply adhesive bandage to their nails, which is where these people hold onto.

When properly formed in the bladder is that which resides within it precisely, as follows:
And he who tells this story shows its manifestation and abbreviation.
So it is said that urine produced mainly in the bladder of children; and from its kidnethy (kidney), the urine seems like water due to its subtlety, appearing therein [in the area]; and the uterus chafes the pubic bone, causing discomfort with intermittent pains. In this place it is necessary that a forum be held for these issues.
And it is a healing for those children within who have reached fourteen years, and treatment in the limbs is difficult. When it is necessary for youths to move among these waters (or humors), there are four spaces between them where movement occurs.
From that from which the stone is larger and poultice applied lighter; if it is scarce, contrary to that.
So when you reach the treatment of that, cover it with a cloth from which worms crawl out completely through the hole where your bones are; this hole occasionally prevents dirt and lice inspection.

Prepare the tool as directed and remove it from there at that spot where you've secured your hand (This translation maintains clarity while attempting to convey an action sequence within medieval medical practice, likely referring to a specific procedure or instrument handling.)

Order the servant to press upon your bladder with their hand; and direct another attendant from over there extend hands towards those parts below (likely referring to lower abdominal regions), while instructing yet another of them, if necessary, tighten around that area where needle actions are occurring—this might relate to suturing or other precise procedures within the site. The translation aims at capturing both direct orders and context-specific medical language from medieval times into contemporary English without losing any detail regarding professional responsibilities during an operation:
Returns it into its bedroom (its cavity), and places your hand over this area so that the intestine does not come out. And divide the water between the knee and thighs herein present; not in the middle of the left hip socket, but on that stone above the knee joint—thus forming a transverse section which makes the section wide enough to be cut according to the amount necessary for this place, without exceeding what is needed since it contains the portion already there within the abdomen.
Be aware that there is no stone from which treatment can be done due to the fact it has angles and edges; thus care must be taken here.
From that fluid it appears like a lion roaring upon its hunt, round and made of body humors for purification (or cleansing).
So if it is that which has been turned or stretched outwards in any part of you, adjust within the crack.
If there is not an opening for the cure (treatment), then make a design over that part which hurts or where you apply pressure on it, ensuring your finger with a file when applying this to the skin surface; do not escape from doing so – insert immediately undernethy instrument of delicate curvature.
May you not be able to hold on to that, then increase the disturbance a little; if you see flow of bile coming out, dissolve it quickly with sulfuric vinegar (vitriol).
May your stone is one of it [the bladder], then lead the mass to its mouth, and press on it there; also carry another small amount here with you; seemingly they are bile stones from disorders.
If there is heavy blood (pathology), ignorance on your part leads you to insert that large section into the uterus, where it either stagnates or ascends due to continuous urine discharge; thus, not all parts are fully secured.

Attach the thread firmly and tie it over that stone piece on the bone to prevent its return into the bladder (this line suggests an attempt at surgical fixation or restraint, likely in medieval medical practice). The context implies managing some type of fistula or abnormal connection where urine might flow outside the body cavity
Insert iron into that stone piece (potentially as part of an intervention or tool), through which the forceps can easily reach to address it at that specific bone site. This line indicates a procedure using metal implements for surgical purposes, possibly related to setting fractures, removing foreign objects like stones from body cavities, or other internal treatments in medieval times (it suggests an operation where precision is critical The forceps rotates within that small bone piece gradually and completely punctures the existing hole, after which it's clear all traces of urine have been drained out (this line implies a methodical approach to repairing or remediating an injury involving fluid loss from bladder perforation). Here we see detailed account in medieval medical literature describing precise surgical technique likely used for treating urogenital trauma. The use of forceps suggests skillful manipulation and removal during the procedure, crucial elements to successful intervention at this period (the text delves into specific

It is not necessary to use chain of the belt on stone suddenly (in other words: do not immediately apply restraint with such material), but rather to prevent it from returning back into its cavity, and once this has been done, if you have loosened said fastener previously attached above undernethyardum ("on or below"), then as soon as the belt is released thereupon (from around that area where adjustments were made), the cushion/support returns to place and reclaims ground.
When it is necessary to lift the leg below (to treat or adjust), you must raise the knee joints upwards (towards their respective positions) and return your touch for what was previously discussed together with them.

The translation is: "And the location of this stone in a woman's body extends beyond that place for which you intend to remove it; thus there are fears." Here 'seccio' likely refers to an intended removal or treatment (such as surgery) of stones, and expresses concerns about going into areas where these remnants might be. This historical medical text reflects the complexity and challenges faced by practitioners in treating health conditions like gallstones before modern medicine existed.

From the treatment of an intestinal protrusion (herniation).
The appearance of this hernia is due to a section that extends over the stomach from various parts of its belly chamber, through which if those clogs reach towards the other ends of these blockages, then it appears as such.

When the patient'dict breath enters in sections of the chest cavity, it happens suddenly with intense pain; various symptoms appear on the seemingly protected spine, and this is due to inflammation of the intestines (budel), affecting mainly the parts farthest from the navel within the abdominal area.
Some movements cause distension of the intestine (belly), and it is called this intestinal protrusion here.
Some winds cause pain and some rush into the opened part of the intestine, where they are retained, due to a great deficiency in the humors (bodily fluids) of the uterus, causing severe and increasingly intense pain when pressure is applied.

When you cover in the other part of the body and both feet.
If the head of the fetus is large, or if it's constricted in labor, cover that which thrust between the dilation and fissure at the head, insert an instrument named "aludat", whose form will derive from those forms found on other instruments for this purpose.
It appears that the text is written in an archaic form of Romance languages with some Latin influence, which makes it challenging to translate without significant expertise in medieval linguistics or medical terminology from this period and region. Nevertheless, I'll attempt a rough translation based on recognizable elements:
If the head is sick and compressed by the breastbone, then it has been opened into wherein the moisture that exists in the chest has become released/liberated.
May it not become complicated and do not eat excessively; if so, then cut the head as soon as you can within your power.
If a hole is found in the abdomen or it descends into its cavity, then you must pierce that which contains the moisture within it.
If it is on their feet, then the attraction of you to them will be light and in your direction towards their mouth will also be light.
May it be that you have squeezed the belly and chest where there lies clothing wrapped around your body; remove what is outside so that water can flow through those areas which are bound by such material at this time.
May if the other members are bent and turn back their head; may if the patient's mouth is open wide, insert it into its chest region below her shoulder blade; then pinch that area with a finger or fingers (one or two), and thrust them down to where they enter inside the woman’thy mouth.
If the mouth of the woman is constricted by apendicitis and you must lance it, do so carefully to avoid causing her pain thereon; above all, administer drainage for causes of wet greasy humors then: Embrace bandages; follow the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
If it is on his chest, then if possible, make an incision with a sharp instrument: and administer the medicine we have mentioned for him.
If it is not possible, then be inserted into pillows and extracted.
When no cause of secondary illness is found.
When you have completed all of your treatment, then administer what we have discussed for the medicated cuffs that I've fastened on which ache from the mother (i.dict patient).
If you have an outflow of bile, then direct it into clear, fast-moving waters and administer the other treatment.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: And you have already seen a woman in her womb who was pregnant again, and placed one on that foreconceived child, which is also another being within her. Occasionally an abscess has been present within the patient's limb for a long time, and it enters into swelling that affects both arms.
And when it is called for healing of him/her, and has been treated long time ago, the child does not get solidified (or mature).
Now you hold it over some hard-pressed bands of forceful compression, and strike an arm bone with a stone or similar tool for several days on high fevered nights; so much that there is not room left in the belly for such heavy object!
And so you consider that they are bones of a dead fetus.
So then you clothe the patient in linen and extract limestone stones from their intestines where women exist within them, having done so for a long time; correcting it by means of a small bracelet (brace).
And you do not affirm oneself to be strange but in water there is knowledge and help that the doctor applies for healing through care.
Of the instruments necessary for extracting the fetus.
Form of returning in which she is brought out:
This is how one becomes strained in which two limbs are bound together: with these bindings on the ends of both feet'thy hands serve as supports/props for each other, thus binding them tightly and promoting healing through immobilization. (Note that some phrases may not have exact modern English equivalents due to historical differences in medical terminology.) Whenever this virtue is subtle as straps and either flesh or wood from trees,
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
These two additions are placed in the mouth of the mother so that she can take them when you rotate the given medicines provided.
Another appearance of that subtle and light substance has appeared below it:
It is pain caused by iron or boars according to the likeness of forceps. When in that limb two additional times are added with pauses between each addition and the length of those additions is a hand'dictate their height to be two fingers high.
When you wish for these chambers to be opened by the master (doctor), then make sure that a woman is placed on her back with weights hanging downwards; this will open what there already exists between their thighs, where some fluid has accumulated within them. Here comes the first sentence to translate: Place your hand over the instrument you use for cutting, as much as desired by the judgment of the mother within where it is set up in accordance with preference.
The method by which they turned things around in old times is as follows:
Form of pressure applied by which he pushes down on the fetus:
Form of friendship that he has come across with which he knows (the big head).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And when it is assembled with forceps in the extremity, occasionally and sometimes several times using this method, as done previously with these instruments where they grasped and counted on them. Form of healing few times or infrequently:
The shape of an arrowhead has a spine:
Shape of an ulcer has nails/spines:
Form of scab has two ends at which the head is detached:
Form of two shields in Latin:
All these instruments are used, and when their quantities increase as they prepare them for the patient' extrication process, place some on her bed and others with your hands according to quantity required.
And when it is necessary for those instruments not to work (here), there is no exemption from this necessity.
From the second extraction (assuming "De" is a preposition meaning 'from' or 'of', similar
When the second extract is grasped tightly by the patient, you must command the illness that holds it to release their appendix (assuming "segondina" refers to an inflamed organ or area within context), and perform a careful retraction with your forceps; press firmly on its mouth and nostries so if through this action they expel what'sin inside, be content.
If not, then take a warm bath and pierce through the cover with a disruption tool, pause in that burning herb where the mother'thy mouth is soothed by calamus and fennel seeds, rue and clove oil, and cassia bark. All these herbs or some of them are submerged in water within the wave and placed upon the flame.
And place one end of the catheter in the mouth of the woman, and insert that into where her vomit collects inside the womb.
When that particular swelling has appeared as mentioned earlier, and its reduction proceeds quickly (swiftly), then...
May if you wish to proceed with this treatment and avoid surgery, then command the matrona to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or rosewater bathing (infusion), and have it inserted into his/her navel; as soon as that has been done, insert your second one thereafter according to what we recommend. If you choose a method within the mother's womb today, then place said secondary intervention inside just like before so that the midwife does not forcefully assist in childbirth delivery when she sees it; remove her gently afterward by pulling out small sections at a time until completion occurs. Before it is permitted at the sides of the hips for ease and comfort (When one allows adjustment or movement at the hip joints, this can provide relief from discomfort).
If the mother'thy mouth is constricted, we have already prepared the cautery and medical care of water from wells or medicinal herbs for treatment.
May not all causes recommended be followed, and keep watch lest you touch that which is in iteration (repeating or cyclical), but if someone from it comes into the mouth of the woman, cover that with cloth and take four medicines; these will purify her for clean days ahead and dissolve any remaining embarrassment.
When the potion is taken and it raises the evil within them (the patient), both in the head and stomach, then when they have been administered under smoke purification methods that are suitable for such an illness;
May those of Antiques come under fumigation with nitre and dried figs.
The form of this tool through which a woman is subjected retains menstrual blood and the second womb fluid, herein lies their hands.
Suffering is of bone or sinew.
When the subtle part is below in the chest and the extensive part above the focus, and the underflowing humidity is stopped beneath the ribs of the foci,
And now take that tongue into which some of that underflow has been ingested, and repeat this process again.
Of treating an unharmed child' extramammary (outside of the breast) region; not pierced or perforated through surgical
From what I can discern from the medieval text you've provided (which appears to be in a pseudo-Latin or an archaic form of Romance languages), and attempting to interpret your question about "Motz enfantz naysso e les culs de lu no so perforat," it seems like there might have been Indeed, the text suggests that if not treated by his/her own lady (matrona), then he shall pierce it himself with a sharp implement (possibly an aglet or lancet used in medieval times for lancing wounds). The caution is added to ensure that one does not touch any raw flesh, likely indicating concern about contamination and the spread of disease.
And place it over that cloth soaked in wine and oil, and take care of the wax inside where there is contained within it.
If you fear that it is dilated (possibly referring to a swolthy or bloated body part), then pause in the throat with a catheter for days and observe when the child will start discomfort/complain.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And you have constricted the pupil of the patient' extramundane for purgation or putrefaction; hence, once that this consolidation is set in place, take care with what we had said about its treatment and lead.
From treatment for those ulcers that come upon us suddenly.
Lumps that occur in the lower junction of connection and larger parts, which come from behind or within one section'thy connections:
When it is a fistula or abscess.
When that ancient connection is dry and out of moisture white or subtlety poured, some measures are taken for these ulcers.
Those penetrating ones are guarded by this water that it comes in and out of them; some even employ the medicine for exits, and others suffer from these same pains.
From those fistulas occasionally present within the bladder space, and entering into the flesh of the testicle; from those that enter at the junction of the scrotum and the thigh:
When a catheter (the "tie" mentioned here) is inserted into the anus and does not penetrate, it means you place it in the anus itself, inserting delicate or iron instruments through the fistula when there'thy no discomfort.
If in that dislocation the humors enter under such subtle attempts of lead or fur from a horse within which you feel the attempt or touch on your thigh,
If you do not feel that sensation in all of it nor proceed any cause of digestion or worms and windiness, as we have said before, then know that it is non-permeable, and thus take care for yourself.
When the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the prostate, it signifies that its purpose is to expel urine from there and thus make this location medicine'thy for curative purposes.
May it enter the juncture of the thigh or into the bone and incite pain throughout the circuit, then its name is that which seeks to enter here if not already within the bone, causing further pain upon entering this part; and such requires immediate treatment with purgatives. And none can heal it therewith nor by waxing sealed.
In all those perforating sores there is not a complete cure; their healing and weakening work upon the humors, which they firmly hold within them.
May heal as hoped for if it is not piercing and does not age soon, cure by iron according to your recommendation, which has already been administered, so that nothing further needs addition.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If that individual feels pain from within their colon expanding into the rectum, immediately insert your finger to relieve them in the rectum.
If you feel the toe trying to push through and as such sense something between your thighs (and possibly that which is penetrating), be certain that it is indeed penetrant; hence do not attempt in those places where there'thy no healing, for we have spoken of them.
May there also arise among those who are healthy in sound bodies such individuals as these.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If the attempt enters and does not penetrate to where it is in the belly, between that which serves as hope for flesh or bone, and a fistula forms on its surface within this place, dry out the navel of the wound's extremity with dampness; once done so at the site of the attempt, let moisture enter through there to where the limb tip is located. And thusly will you free it from and heal (the attempted entrance).
Return mercury (or some form of quicksilver, often used in medical treatments for its purported antiseptic properties) to those clogged veins where they have been assembled together with a penis needle and do not break apart from any cause.
May the flow of pus sometimes enter between you and your body cavity when those parts are inside it; then, with instruments for purulent inflammation or acute medicine at hand, cauterization is applied either to that area where these swollen bodies have been adjusted, achieving detoxification, as well as the abscess exudate.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When treatments with stoppage and execution are used, once restored the patient is healed and does not fear repetition.
May it be that the fistula has entered into the belly of a person and is lengthened on the surface of their body; then insert your finger therein at its location, to investigate further within.
Therefore if cent scores of flesh and between you and her it is covered by tissue or meat, then intervention cannot be performed there but rather through a second route based on trust and hope.
The given text is a medieval medical treatise in Latin-influenced language discussing the treatment of certain conditions: Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
And insert into that faithful covering of flesh or surrounding these, and attempt to insert the foot within the fistula whereby continuation is achieved for it.
May if it penetrates into the margin of the anus propoundingly inserted, then remove that foreign object from where you have thrust it inwardly; extract its tip and adjust both ends accordingly, applying pressure to each one for a day or two until possible recurrence of insertion. Whenever more frequently inserts itself back inside the body, tighten into place those flesh portions between which this end enters (i.e., where fingers meet anus).
When proper care is given so that it becomes solidified and healed.
If the orifice of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it so in whatever manner you have prepared, but do not insert anything into it unless necessary to prevent falling out of place (le lacert). Only attempt this after ensuring that which is inside has been healed.
The shape of the spine is what forms the fistula; its curve is sharp and the other division is smooth, therefore it's not necessary to insert anything unless needed sometimes.
From the seam of hemorrhoids where blood flows within that area.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "Emorroydas so segon dos manieyras," either between the buttocks seemingly made of flesh or where those are composed like bread with grease, these two places serve as their passageways for waste materials. From those small and large, which come from the joints of those limbs during heats (which is one), and movements/motions, and outside the body cavity, in the extremities of the patient:
Even though there are those whose buttocks protrude due to little moisture in the body cavity, where yellow water or a small drop of sanctus wine continues flowing constantly and according to the color of the body, it is observed accordingly.
And the cure for that which has been inserted into the colon is to command the humors (or pus) within it so they settle and appear at your location, where you can attend to them. Now you bite and clench your teeth around the part where those are held by your tongue, and apply pressure to their reasons with that same tongue.
If the unguis is not tightened in those places due to their moisture, then take these ashes or a sharp sponge or wool cloth and cleanse them there; also powder some of that ash on the incision for they are at risk where cauterization takes place. Or apply it according to what precedes in the process of cauterizing. Return that same care for those things within which they have been healed.
If the belly does not heed expulsion (reflux or vomiting), then crush and wash in that water which is present in the colon, whereupon it will aid to prevent reflux emanation when the bowel squeezes.
May if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is humidity or dampness, and it's necessary to grasp those with your finger nails (or thumbnails), insert them, and take care of these things until they have been healed inside where we mentioned.
Here is the translation line by line:
When it is necessary for all of them (humors) and not just that one which should be expelled from the body, thus allowing excess humoral fluid to drain from that particular source.
And place your hand over the buttocks, dipped in oil or clay; and there it rests on the colon, commanding the humors to stop their flow. When you place it inside that box; and when it is healed, take care of those bound with wax or other curative medication within the said box.
When they are ancient and of no value in that medicine, then you must break open the hardened stone or your own wax seal inside which there are already dry points infected with pus from below; this prevents them from healing (consolidating). Here is the translation: "When these ulcers have become old and useless according to medical standards, one should carefully crack a fistula stone or their personal antiseptic wax seal inside which dried out infection points exist—this action hinders any attempt for them to heal (consolidate). Here is the translation: "When these ulcers have become ancient and not beneficial according to medical principles, one must diligently break open a fistula stone or their own antiseptic wax seal where dried infection points exist—this action prevents any attempt at healing (consolidating)." Here is the translation for "De curacio de fistulas":
Break open those that are full of violent purulent matter and have been scalded, and care for those that have already healed within them (in this context). Here is the translation: "Break open those ulcers with a strong infection inside that were first burned or scalded; attend to those ones now cleanly sealed." This line indicates an action directed towards treating infected and damaged areas of fistulas, suggesting breaking them apart (in this case possibly referring metapthyically
Understand that when the limb is closed and not swolthy (thickened), observe its color at the end of closing it up; feverishness occurs throughout the body and mainly in the joints of the feet and knees, for which gloves are needed due to these pains.
And when the fluid has entered into the joint and is lodged in its crevices or bursae (the lubricating sacs around some of our body's movable joints), it must be removed entirely from there, and proper care should then follow for that area.
If you wish, cauterize the second one that precedes in his chest.
May small ulcers appear rough and rounded on the surface of the body, and they often come about in children most frequently.
In caring for him/her is to extend and insert that which will hold faithfully or within the enclosed space you have created with it. If you wish, then burn it as we have said earlier, at the focus or in acute medicine.
May small or tortuous worm be prominent on the surface of the body in general and when it is crushed therein, it causes pain throughout the body.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If you wish, make a catheter of clay or iron according to this form:
Here comes the first sentence to translate:
If you wish to cauterize the ant, as mentioned in the process of cauterization here, then proceed accordingly with caution using one of our tools for treatment (cauterizer).
From how these instruments are administered to give relief.
Some times it is silver or copper salve (ointment) made of these materials: and some are crafted from small to large tools used for treating them; the one applied in children's care is small, while those intended for adult wounds are bigger ones.
La form of scab is large and sparse:
The head of the downpipe in which the bag is large according to this methodology; and that's where it is connected at intervals as specified hereinabove.
The translated text line by line is as follows:
And if it is in the bag where their urine cups (vesica of beast or lamb) are paused and its handle is a hand, then this refers to the container used for medical treatments with these specific vessels.
When pierced by force due to twisting, and if the space where this has occurred contains its thickness (the injured part), then:
Here comes the first source sentence translated line by line into English:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If medicine forces it out (referring possibly to the patient' extruded body part), take as much of it back as possible; and if rest is needed after taking a dose for an entire day, then more vital energy may return tomorrow.
If you tighten that within the abdominal pains and exhalation of breath in their belly button (likely referring to applying pressure or a bandage), then repeat the application of cautery until healed.
If in the belly there are drops or lice entangled, then gently place under them and on top of it (the remedy), for these are what children identify with their signs.
Of disease treatment or healing of diseases.
You are already in the division of curing diseases that suit free will, and you declare this cure for those afflictions along with their remedies according to completenency.
So it is said that pains are diverse depending on where they manifest and how the needle penetrates those areas.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: When causes of movement are pains caused by wind-damp humors accumulating in their bowels with a stone placed inside for treatment, or due to constriction of spleen and liver (or obstruction from sharp points like arrows/spears), or percussion on the body using staff, sword, axe, scythe, resembling these causes.
May the humors that are present in the body'thy locations so appear with a worm upon the head, or neck (the col), chest (pectus), abdomen (venter), waist (fitium), and resemble those of the limbs.
And when recommending a cure for some diseases, it provides pause and control over other illnesses as well.
When you consume foods that simplify diseases of the head, and when remembering these simple conditions come to feast on the third capital (head), meaning in this context: When one consumes things beneficial for treating minor issues with the brain or mind, it will contribute positively during cognitive therapy sessions.
Therefore say that when you feel pain in the head simple and not from a fracture, consider: if it' extrication of stone or appearance thereof has happened; then thrust your cudgels into the occipital as quickly as possible, do not delay too long. Extract to the second joint according to the quantity present unless no cause prohibits cutting (the operation), mainly when this head is small and suffering from apendicitis.
If it is a flawbition of the contrary parts that are afflicted, and you must protect (the abdomen) from overfilling due to excess consumption of meat and drinks heavy in nature.
May it be that with careful observation you will prevent any cause and reduce the amount of food consumed so as not to approach meat or drink.
When pressure is applied over soil (likely referring here metaphorically to the ground or bed), if you numb an abscess with cautionous application of oil rubbed on it, they are steadied in a manner whereby they settle down effectively within that which contains them.
If you are sure about the application of poultice and if it has recently rained or the air is damp, wait until that which coats your hand (the powder recommended for small applications) settles down before applying the poultice on the ground.
If the air has changed and it is necessary for healing within (inside), place a cloth dipped in oil inside while being cured.
May the child be large or through ignorance of spaces and appearances, and if their lips are not properly adjusted for puppies, then fix those with stitches as recommended by them (doctors).
May it be that the child has been discovered between bone and pen (bone and skin), but not restrained by you with anything more than a small suspender; thus inquire about that very same one as medicine brings back flesh to its natural place within the cranium, commanding the humors of phlegm: cabbages and vegetables like broth or gruel, putting some into their mouths (and feeding them), so long as it is prepared for consumption.
If there is decay in the spine and it does not stick to the bone, then you cut off all this putrefied material with water and apply careful attention (to clean).
May if in these plagues the artery or vein through which blood may flow becomes exposed and is not healed by medicine, then you must examine that particular vessel; and if it has been damaged but not severed, cut into it with a sponge or ligature, provided this does not cause additional discomfort to what we have mentioned.
If these pains are simple and small, then the cause of them is a chill; apply powder to those areas until this very day when the cold dissipates them.
The mania of the polish: this is a recipe where one ensis chopped into pieces, two parts of dragon'dictone each (which have not been extinguished), three in total; all mixed and crushed together herein lies its powdered form, which when consumed within these walls will be formed as le sanc.
Return the strength there to its pills and legs, and do not let them slide while they are lying down so that medicine is administered when healed.
When any one performs only cautery alone, they are not in their presence with thy essence and sanctified thunder-stone.
And now this operation takes place on the large humors when it is deemed necessary that they be stopped over them and are already settled in their sources, wherein the air has not been disturbed.
If the air has been altered, and especially in summer time, you do not understand where this powder is placed, then take care of those places with stronger medicines that we have mentioned before; or pause on these dusts from flour mixed with water and honey inside which syrup will heal them. Furthermore, pay attention to the other remedy while they are being cured.
If you break a bone in your body, and it is small, then extract the water from its movement.
Yeah directs the treatment of skull fractures in this poisonous substance/medicine that is being used.
From the diseases of the colon.
If you have an acid in the chest, there is no difference in medicine; and between the child'se head when it is simple.
May the nerve of the colon or artery be inscribed upon it; if it is a nerve, then it's not in that place for treatment with water which causes strong spasm and fever-like symptoms among them, so do as when taking care of such conditions. With wine and ointments applied to their hands (which they hold), these will help prevent the issues associated with those nervous structures or arteries. No joints stop for any cause of complete madness; the substance of the nerves is also feverish and continues in the brain, which they place into all their members themselves.
If there is a need for the curing of diseases using unguents and waters pure or impure (medicinal solutions), then some washing with clear water, scented oil poured into it, heat applied during the washing process along with other pebbles moving according to this methodology, lubrication of rheumatic joints.
If the child is large, apply stitching or clamp their lips together, and take care that those pills enter until healed.
May it be that if there is depth or pain in the lower parts of the body cavity, then through such an opening pierce into the location where gout has penetrated.
If in the soil there is an inserted artery and blood flow has been obtained from it, then separate or dry that out, or perform cauterization if necessary to provoke a downward movement of fluids (blood).
May you have already fixed the vertebrae of the spine or all, and so protected the veins in the neck, do not touch that; rather adjust the lips of the cushion on the spinal column without touching it; tighten this to restore its natural shape according to structure, apply force as needed for several days until healing. Keep watch over him during these times when care and stimulation are necessary for his recovery.
If the child already experiences pain in the bone, you will strike that area; and if there are fragments of hipbone present, remove all those which you can from them; but if it is not within your power to do so, allow water for the child to become moistened, thus causing separation, afterward removing both the fragmented parts and ensuring detachment.
If the patient is recently ill, then grind some of this powder over them as recommended. May it be that in the dirt there is a leak (fistula), and if so, heals with water from which memory will return to his head.
If it is percussion of lance or cushion, and sometimes the depth, pay attention also when the belly breathes due to winds in the bladder; consider that the body (the patient) is dying.
If there is not depth and the patient's condition has just worsened recently in their lungs, then you pause until the first hour of morning prayer time without straining it so that its sac does not remain deep within the lung and return to the heart while reducing malaute; perhaps also rest with linen applied on them during these observations.
If the ointment is not at hand, then rest in the sweaty bedcloths provided for that water which comes from the humidities; and make sure that gout runs over these dirty linens so it can be drawn out (or absorbed).
May it have passed three days or more without worsening the malady'dictating spasm, tremor of bad blood, nor stricture (constriction) thereof; then you take other good things at your disposal and apply them wisely, so that the patient is saved. In this sentence:
May the healing of it be dismissed if cured in time, and already tightened throughout, then you will know that a fistula has formed; therefore take care of this through your own knowledge as physician.
If the patient' extrusion is due to a fissure or incision and it’s simple on the skin of their thighs or back (the plague), then cure that with water used after suturing if large, or powdered substance if small.
If there is pain in the bone and if those stones have been separated from it, then use a tool to extract them now. May it not be separated, then let those inside come out that they may purge themselves, for their extraction is assisted by separation.
From other accidents in other body parts, health is restored by the water that we have mentioned before.
From stomach troubles or diseases of the belly area (translation based on understanding that medieval medical
The discomfort within your abdomen is either great or slight; it has migrated (translation considering the context that perhaps refers to a condition like gastritis moving from one area of pain in the stomach region). It's essential for medical professionals, even
The desired correction is difficult without another's help (translation suggests that the condition requires assistance beyond what one can manage alone). Surgical removal of them becomes hard, unless you restrain their penetration to your location immediately now, for if they are allowed free movement within it will be challenging how to extract or remove. This indicates an urgency and a need for immediate intervention possibly referring to the management of foreign bodies such as worms (as commonly understood in historical context) that may have entered through ingestion or other means; restraint is key, implying careful handling necessary during extraction procedures due to potential complications if not done correctly.
Therefore the best correction is to remove them (translation suggesting that removal of foreign objects or worms being discussed) since it's not difficult in your abdomen; likewise, extraction from other specified body parts may be challenging as well ("other specialized body parts" could refer here broadly). This underscores the significance and feasibility of addressing these issues surgically when they present within more accessible anatomical locations such as the belly. The
You know that the belly'dicts have four sides (or aspects), and if needed, you may perform stitches which are common to those of other diseases on these parts of the body.
Two other natural connections communicate with each other and possibly even between themselves in the abdominal suture.
Here enters each one of you for examination and disclosure.
Therefore it is said that when the child experiences pain from a protrusion (hernia), and reduction of such becomes difficult: either due to diminutive size upon examination, or because the hernia swells with cold air exposure – one in two approaches are needed.
And when the fluid is rising upwards, at that moment cut and immerse there a moist wool cloth alone or soaked in water movingly, and cloves, pepper, and ointments into this space where inflammation should be resolved.
And when diuretics have been used and it is better than water alone in the resolution of inflammation.
So when the inflammation is resolved, then you moisten the intestine in the place where it has protruded and swelled with water, due to a little cause; this allows for addressing the patient'se internal condition that led to discomfort or pain.
If you manage to release the patient from this treatment, then divide the rupture into small parts using an instrument with which they have been previously numbed (incisions).
The initial part of the text translates as follows in English line by line:
From the tool, its form is as follows:
One sharp turn of the wheel, and the other not acute, and the subtlety, it is neither due to the delicacy of bone—here both parts are blunted with a small tool.
And when the swelling increases and comes out of its place (the intestine or hernia), it is best that you restore its size to what nature intended for it in its own location if at all possible thereon; four times better than not doing so.
When the disruption is wide open and located in the lower abdomen, where you press on their belly button, holding their hands firmly; if it' extruded from below (the ventral cavity), then hold up his head and place cushions underneath them.
Here comes the first source sentence for translation:
When it is necessary that you apply coolness on large accumulations and in places where fluids migrate,
In minor illnesses, the preparation you have made is for your use, and assign that servant to be between your two palms held tightly together, which tongue will hold all disruption within its grasp at this time, and adjusts lips over there from cause here, as needed.

Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Even where the needle is placed in either of the patient'thy thighs for that their flesh may not be cut down and that worming shall have no access to them therein.
And so that there is not a delay in stitching for which the patient may be forbidden from healing.
Return the fingers or ends of needles so that they do not pierce through the patient' extraneous body part, resting over the sewn-open stitches expanded throughout all parts, where these finger/ends are held; and lay them down only when you know that the flesh has already healed.
These surgical tools consist of needles and threads in a manner suitable for small wounds; it is sufficient to use either an individual needle or thread, alternatively that amount used for their suture should suffice therein.
May the second stitch be common: and it is that you gently apply sutures to all four limbs' extremities (from wrist to heel), using a needle of varying fineness and thickness, under careful guidance with your tongue in one sitting.
When the needle is in these four extremities (hands and feet), reduce the needle of that midwife's cut piece where you are working with, to ensure that the wound cavity below has been cleansed into a division for cloth bandaging, so that the dressing will be secure as strong linen.

It indicates the layering of different materials on or around an affected area to promote recovery and suggests that there were sequential steps in treatment procedures related not only to medicinal practices but also practical caregiving tasks
Then take all that which has been taken out (of the pieces used above), and insert it inside where everything is infected or wastage from any of those sections - now entirely full with pus, so you must then cut this into said leather piece; herein lies further caregiving detail.

And advise me to rotate each part of my body as I move, for it is remarkable how the exchange and movement speed between parts can affect one's health according to these teachings (implying a focus on holistic or systemic treatment approaches where coordinated motion might be beneficial). Indeed I had seen such in my own body according to this mannerism; however, there have been times when the wrenching pains shift from limb to another (pointing out an observation of pain migration between different parts or extremities) contrary to their usual experience as per these texts. But I have not seen such in the women'dictor here, suggesting that this particular phenomenon of pain transfer might be observed differently or less frequently among females according to these writings (implying
But I have not considered it to be due to fluids as in the case of a woman who was discovered with many veins and open chests where this shifting sensation occurs (which could refer, within these medieval medical theories possibly suggesting that visible anatomical abnormalities like numerous or prominent vessels might lead to unique symptoms such as fluid movement-related discomfort).

De punctura delle vene (Vein puncture)
These are the veins of which it is customary to cauterize with flebectomy, those from where arises pulsing blood for treatment purposes (arteries), these herbs found in both temples; and these veins located at two tear ducts made by twin streams called aspexictus; the prepared vein near the forehead region of the face, and that which is present on the extremity of the nose. These are also known as algelic (veins), those in both lower lips below, those undernezeno upper lip, two from each nostril made by twin streams called aspicectus; these veins located at different parts: neck vertebra column guides, and that on the tongue's surface. May the veins that have been cauterized in the breasts be full; from those is a cephalic one, and you must bind it with wild thyme leaves (chastebush); another servant on their legs, and yet another on their chest, holding hands. The people call this "the vein of all limbs," wherefore they name the domestic lathe-bound vein as "citrullus" or small wine bowl; and with these leaves (wild thyme), you address them vulgarly called "belly veins." Veins in the arms, which are cauterized over the fireplace thereon – that is where it appears manifestly. The valve-like vessel between this auricular small intestine part and its little abdominal pouch: they call these two branches of thyme (thymus) together "the heart vein," which belongs to them, within their body's walls; here the cauterization occurs – is that very same one.
In the foot and calf there are three veins; one of those is that which curves downwards along the dorsal vein, as in wild boar'dictor (wild species), and the second is saphenous, located at the back part of the leg like its counterpart from domesticated animals. The sciatic vein is also there, similar to what we find in the animal kingdom; and other resembling veins are present alongside them.

The veins that are present in the tongue can be properly cured by pharyngotomy (surgery of the throat), removal from within the soft palate area due to tonsillitis or other mouth illnesses, and diseases related to the roof of the mouth.
The quality of performing such pharyngotomy follows the flow between your cheeks while you raise and examine the tongue; noticing one vein at a time on each side of the tongue where its hue shifts to black, indicating severe venous congestion or other pathologies. This suggests that careful observation is necessary in diagnosing issues related to blood vessels within these areas as indicated by changes such as darkening which could signify underlying health problems needing attention from a medical professional.
And thus proceed with the pharyngotomy where necessary without exceeding it in your efforts to remove those veins there; and be watchful for when these same areas begin showing signs of arteries as well—potentially pointing towards more complex circulatory issues that may require different medical intervention. This reminder underscpective, after a venous issue is addressed through pharyngotomy: the need to remain vig

If the basilica does not appear for obvious manifestation, then you must lay it there and change to another (perhaps secure a strap or bandage), or if bleeding occurs at the end of the arm where that is evident; treat that immediately with cautery as we have discussed.
If you wish to perform the surgery on your patient, then apply pressure downstream of where in your arm you touch inside until reaching between the palms (the wrist area), and secure a bandage over their hand; additionally tighten his/her arm and dry off with a concave cuff used for bloodletting. Also ensure that during this process, pay attention to percussion sounds throughout the spaces around the artery'dict:

Le first of these is where you know that blepharotomy (eye surgery) is not administered but for the conservation of health and hope, with careful management to prevent diseases; it should be done in one of the veins located within the groin - specifically, the cephalic, femoral, and basilica veins. It's performed during breakfast or lunch on Monday morning, after taking food (postprandial), and at dinner time when signs of repletion appear.

Consider carefully in the subtlety of humors coming from foods and drinks if the patient is fat, through meats and wine, or with medicine it's possible to bring such fluids back into their body.

Return now (or proceed) with the cauterization if necessary.
If the opening is small and subtle, and you fear that it will expand quickly, then perform cauterization in the second part of this section and place a few small openings there; once these are made into little spots on the body'dictate where expansion occurs (in other words, when growth happens at those points), they serve as markers.

When bloodletting is not performed on limbs but where position for applying venesection needles cannot be maintained due to their small size (referring perhaps to the fingers and tongue), it should instead be done with a sharp lancet, similar in use as when applied between the nose or teeth.

But if not, apply heat and water to the affected area—it will be beneficial (indicating that applying warmth or using hot compresses with water could help alleviate pain). The use of these methods aligns with traditional practices wherein temperature manipulation was used as a form of treatment. Here we see an early understanding,
If the limbs of Sancus are continuously affected by leaking blood (implying a condition where there is an open wound or sore with persistent bleeding), and thus, fluids seep out; then take cloth soaked in cold water from within your vessel for wrapping around that which has abdicated inside—and keep it upon the area to prevent further loss of fluid. The direction here advises a conservative treatment involving direct application (of an absorbent material) and maintaining pressure over bleeding sites, typical procedures during medieval medicine when dealing with injuries or wounds leading to hemorrhage before modern surgical methods were available. Here we find references not only to the practical aspects
If Sancus multiplies (which could indicate a persistent or widespsread condition), scatter sulfur dust over him three times; or gravel and similar materials to his causes stuck in place—until that which is Sanchus ceases from presence, whereby the beans have adhered within its location. This line outlines an old treatment strategy for conditions involving multiple occurrences of disease (potentially referring metaphorically here). The use of sulfur dust and gravel suggests a belief in these substances' medicinal properties to draw out or absorb something harmful from the body, similar to poultices used throughout history. Here we see an attempt at home remedy using available local materials (sulfur, possibly indicating mercury compounds of its time) and beans as a healing agent through absorption—a common practice when resources were limited or modern medicine was not readily accessible in the past era depicted by this medieval treatise. This method implies an understanding that certain substances can adhere to t

When there is a fracture of the nose, or break in the nose – here lies what can commonly refer to an injury
It is said that the nose isn't broken but divided into pieces placed side by side – of such fractures there are some in old age, wherein two bones make up this breakage; it consists not merely of a breaking and crushing at these spots (the joints), characterized instead by twisting distortion.
If one of the bones is broken and you insert a small object into their nose as directed by this sign here above it (the image or symbol indicating treatment), then withdraw your hand while allowing the nostril to return back to its normal shape naturally. And if it is for your ease that you need this fluid (presumably medication or a substance to alleviate the condition), be careful not to let any of it affect the patient'thy lower abdomen during your operation on them.
If the fracture is in the upper chest portion and does not move towards it, then cover what has been broken with a limb of bone from wherein lies its greatest size.

Habitually caused by overuse is the breakage of a player's wing (furcula), and this injury falls into one of three categories: simple fracture, partial complex fracture, or complete dislocation/separation whereby all pieces are out of alignment. Here 'motas veguadas,' which suggests repetitive actions leading to fatigue, likely refers to the overuse inherent in strenuous physical activity such
When broken it's separated into two pieces that do not remain together as before (indicating possibly non-union or malunion of the bone); recovery in such cases is often lacking, making restoration challenging; alternatively when fractured and displaced like a youngling with multiple breaks which are difficult to restore – care must be taken. This line suggests that healing may not occur naturally ('leugier'), necessitating medical attention wherein the individual might suffer if left untreated, making recovery demanding; or in some cases when fractured and displaced like an infant with several breaks (multiple injuries), treatment is especially difficult. Here 'quar' could be a term used to describe severely misaligned fragments that are challenging for medical professionals ('metges') to realign properly, potentially implying the
When the injury is as severe (suggested by 'la fractura es ses plagua,' indicating a severely broken bone), it's time for two hands to be involved: one hand acts as an assistant and holds onto what remains of the shattered wing, while the other extends support along that part.

Leads to immobilization until rest is achieved (until you stop), then return it back to its proper state or position ("torna la strictura"). Here's the translation considering context: Lead to restricted movement within which period of cessation,
If the restriction is relieved and your bones are back to their usual condition alongside an appearance of normalcy in them all around ("es mollificada", "remaugut e semblantz ad aquels"), then rectify that which has been removed or altered from its original position within you. Here' extriction is possibly referring not just physical but also some pathological process, perhaps related to the body’s humoral composition as indicated by earlier lines
Consider if the nourishment is being restricted and thus preventing proper function of that body part due to excessive restriction; in this case, soften what limits it today (tomorrow or within days), giving small amounts as needed while restoring necessary sustenance for those parts until such supply reaches its required levels. Here we see a concern with dietary and nutritional aspects affecting the body's humoral balance that might exacerbate conditions like gout: Ensure if there’s any deprivation of nourishment leading to unnecessary constriction, then soften what limits it today (daily or within days), administer small amounts as necessary while restoring essential sustenance for those
If there is no cause within the malady that we have mentioned for it not to be alleviated in two days or less from those effects, then do nothing further inside of them during this period.
And place its limpness in the abdomen due to overactive motion and let it sleep on their backs.
Understand that this fracture is restored in either xxx days or xxxii days, and all of this depends on the complexity of the injury and the disposition of the body'dictum (meaning) as stated here takes into account both the nature of the breakage and how one’s constitution reacts to such injuries.

When referring to the restoration of the little finger's phalanx and metacarpus (the bones in your hand), this line from a medieval medical text could translate roughly into English as
When the little finger's phalanx and metacarpus are broken (fractured), one should not become sad but must be persistently attentive to their care/treatment. Here, "restoration" can refer both to physical healing of bones as well as psychological resilience or encouragement during the recovery period.
When you have the injury or dislocation of the limb in place and below it there are ten levels equally spaced apart, then hold that part over the extended area for balance support.
Whenever it is necessary for the minister (physician) to extend the broken bones and where there are good connections, do so accordingly.
When pressure is applied with plaster and thread (implements), if the ulcer does not heal on its own, then apply a stopper stone below according to the size of the area, which you have already wrapped in cloth.
If the bruise is in the parts of dissection and appears like a sheet'suponerence (suggesting an illusion or mirage), then command the humors to constrict that spot with pressure using one’s palm; make it long.
Whenever the body' extrinsic part is covered by cloth, ensuring that the body rests on the palm of your hand and strengthening it next in order:
If the fracture is in parts beyond repair, then stop pressing below and above stones of that part which has been previously injured on your palm so it becomes covered and tightened; and also cease pressure there where you have rotated your hand between these ligaments.
If you injure one of the knees joints (hips), and it hurts in your thigh bone (femur), then apply pressure with a cushion on top, as well if you wish to elevate it using the small stone from its palm. This way, preventing the fractured part from becoming swolthy or inflamed.
May it be as when in that joint where the bone is fractured, or at its place indicated by heat, or on the earlobe (auricular), or around the ankle ring (anular), then apply grease and hold there until healing occurs; if they are all broken continuously, rest over each small stone like we do here in our foot.
Consider when in your restoration the arrangement of applied and opposed caution—that is the operation at hand—whenever you encounter any cause related to that narration of yours as it unfolds.
Given that this medieval text seems to blend elements of languages from
In the treatment of a hip bone fracture.
The bones of the thigh are worn down and it is declared according to what has become in that way concerning departure from bed rest and rising upwards.
The restoration of the patient is done such that the ligament tightens over the fracture, and another bandage wraps around their abdomen and face.
Whenever the minister extends it fully according to its quality where the bone is broken in place of rest,
If there is reason for the sinew to be stretched at the knee joint (the pivot of the leg), then attach one lashing along the part where the patella bone meets the thighbone, so that it extends within them and another alongside the fracture. Here's the translation:
If the joint is prone to dislocation, then it will be sinew bound with linen and extended to the parts immediately afterward.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: And if you make the doctor warmth and ease those two halves into each other as they naturally connect in good union; when there is numbness or tightening of a contracted limb, do not apply pressure on it. May you alleviate the ulcer if it worsens within days until the sore is healed over, and then return to your care.
The strictness of it is pain: cover which encases the fracture with hard bandage, and fold that twice or thrice, reduce excess; also wrap around what enters inside so that reaches up to the ankle and the root of the thighbone.
Here the long needle is inserted between the thigh and the change of cloth provided for those parts immediately above the joints where pain occurs, with their extremities being pushed upwards by the weight of the bandage; this motion continues until any excess from the bandage needs to be removed.
Return your pause (or position) over the area of that bone breakage as it were set in place, and a cushion is placed on top of the patient'thy thighbone to prevent movement or displacement:
Return and fill up the spaces between the blanket and thighs with molasses to make sure that any discharge is clotted out.
Here begins the treatment of a severe constriction from cold mercury above at the site of the break within three or four layers/envelopes; and as you move away from the location of the fracture, your tightness decreases, so ease it with lubrication and moisture.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Return your arms' extremities to the parts where they enter before reaching the chest cavity, and strengthen them with their own ligaments; thus preventing dislocation from its place.

May if there is pressure in the bone where it was set up by you, then cover that second one with what'dict; and otherwise apply pressure on it until relief comes, taking care of its condition which has preceded healing within sight.
And when some measures are taken for this hip joint breakage as were mentioned earlier in the help and arm aid,
Even in the process of restoration like this, you will not heal the leg that is limping; and if it' extricated alone, another cushion must be applied thereafter by your hand, for then they shall continue walking on that very foot which was previously injured.
E understand that the thigh is tense in forty days or a few months and all of this varies according to the complexity of the conditions and available resources.

If you experience a break in the limb of someone else (implying an injury or fracture), it is not simply a crack but rather a dislocation or more severe damage to their parts; and all this makes up one'dictated emotion/feeling within them.
The restoration of him is done by pouring water that has been broken from the parts into where it can be collected and then joined together, as far as balance in body fluids allows for ease of use and construction.
And apply pressure and bandaging over that round stone if necessary, holding your hand above it to relieve the tightness towards water (i.dict for healing).

Translation: Where in the bone (camba) there are two parts - one large and named for its location as "the crank," while the other is small and called a fulcrum; here begins our explanation of how to address such fractures. This medieval text suggests that they were familiar with anatomy, particularly identifying specific bones like those in the leg (possibly referring to parts involved when walking or running). The large part being referred to could be analogous to what modern medicine might
Treat with the poultice of healing for these two bones in your arm (translation: "accideys" is interpreted as applying a remedy or treatment), and likewise this cure will restore it to its full function, just like when treating an unbroken limb. The passage implies that medieval doctors used poultices made from healing herbs for both broken (fractured) bones in the arm and intact ones, suggesting a standardized approach to treatment irrespective of whether or not there was a fracture involved – emphasizing restorative care rather than surgery.
If you twist two bones together (translation: "trinczat" means to grip or bind; here it likely refers to an incorrect handling of the limb), then the crank becomes all parts [of the leg]. This line indicates that
If you have twisted one small bone (translation: "os pus" refers to any smaller or delicate parts; modern terms might be 'phalanges' in fingers and toes), the crank becomes all these [parts] Dens (translation:
If there is a fracture in your big toe, immobilize it immediately, and these are the reasons that aren't under your control.
And administer stretching and walking exergy and limberity of the joints according to that mannerism.
Whenever a crack in the kneecap has movements that are displaced or misaligned (fracture), it should be bent and put on a cushion to support its position by your own willpower/effort.
When there is any cause for operation on the arms, and when you grasp the tongs to perform the entire surgery, take wooden splints made of ash that has been dried after being placed just where those causes have already been paused in soles (i.dict sunlight), as a treatment for pains and aches caused by white palm plantar fasciitis; attach these tools to what is sought with grooves, not fingers, according to the length of that area, and insert them into it immediately afterward.

The translation of the given sentence appears to be:
If the bones of the foot are broken and sometimes those bones are lifted between them themselves, then ligament thighs rest their feet on the earth prepared for this purpose previously.
When pressure is applied to one foot above those bones that are being lifted upwards, and when the heel of each foot is pressed into place so they return to their respective places within them.
Return painful and stopping bleeding in the abdomen using a small table with two covers: place it on his stomach to stop internal flow, where your hands will hold these tools.
Return strength to that part of the body which lacks structure and wrap it along with others due to various reasons for which they seek treatment.
When three or four days have passed, then unlace the bandage, and crush or set back in place the broken bones or joint displacements, at which point surgery is required.
If the patient' extrusions are present as boilings (which implies swollen lymph nodes or abscesses), restore those, and anoint them with oil to heal in your care for their restoration.

When a bone is broken while it's still growing (in children), the treatment often differs due to the potential for growth plate damage and natural healing abilities:
With such an injury in children (when bones are broken), it is to that which you apply the fracture, and usually if the bone has suffered significant force alongside another part of the body or similar object, then immobilize this location immediately with a splint—do so as per your doctor' extramural instructions.
If the child falls sick and worsens their condition by crawling on them while you lack another cause for this illness, then restrain them to prevent further aggragy, provided there is not yet any other reason behind it.
When it is time to begin healing the fracture on that day, do not extend treatment unless an abscess forms.
May you apply cauterization if there is an ulcer, and as long as the ulcer heals within three days (from today to tomorrow), that's when you do it; otherwise, you risk causing bad accidents by applying treatment on day three or beyond.
If your bone is broken and protrudes from the neck (the collarbone area), then you must take care to reduce that which has been fractured, for it will be easier on your hands with a little extension of those parts involved.
May it not be stretching beyond your preparation, and the equipment of you are in their hands; those tools which have been made of iron, with a length of seven digits or eight (approximately two feet), and whose width corresponds to twice the quantity of grain; thus necessitating that the doctor grind these three or four pieces according to what is required for healing during bone fracture treatment in all specialties.
And be given rest, and in little discomfort for that there is not to strain the comprehension over it during surgery.

For that purpose for which his limb is raised in order to attend, he should stand on the tip of it (the extended limb).
When he returns his bones and has them gently washed within a couch (bed), placing some on the legs' chairs (stockings or braces).
So you will need to grasp the limbs of the fracture and if that part of his body is delicate and does not take such treatment, then have someone insert the appropriate tool into that bone which has power over it.
May you not be able to reduce the bone of all that we have applied, then separate and extract from these pus what comes out today by us; or cut off one of your saws for any manner in which it may suit you.
Return that which is rough in the bone of hardness and sharp little nails,
When the bone is reduced (set in place), and you have achieved that reduction, thereafter it greatly alleviates pain which would otherwise be vehemently lamented; consequently, herein lies where you will confer great benefit upon the humpback.
When your restoration is complete and the cloth draped undernethy precisely (and) if it's summer, place nothing on top of the soil or any other cause that oil may fall upon it; thus preventing injury and decay from happening herein.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Even with utmost caution not to strain the child at risk of a break, as doctors often advise these measures over time due to injuries or illness that can worsen their bones' health, thus it becomes sickly. If it is a looseness in the joint that is different from other types of bone breaks or fractures.
If the patient is large or ill and fears those harmful accidents that have been recommended to you, causing pain in the area, do not pause over these astrolabes; perhaps they should be wrapped tightly with hard cloth at the site of stars (or bones/joints) where there are them.
When once or twice a day the patient begins to cough, which occurs above their belly button where they have placed a cloth as per our customs for treating diseases, then take away that fabric beneath them and administer medicinal ointments on these spots according to tradition. Here is the translation line by line:
And when you gather to fasten and consider the leather in each day' extrication time between morning and evening, so that the limb is prepared according to this method for easy insertion of the needle.
If the child passes through days without rest and their bra is not consolidated nor detached from them, then you know that they are covering small movements to attempt escape. From those satagias (likely referring to blockages or accumulations), the ones that are separated and extracted, which if not removed will result in putting on limbs and causing pain, you must attend to them as best as possible according to what is feasible for you.
If you squeeze the flesh or bones, it is considered swelling or rot and decay; therefore, pause on one of those things which are required for treatment as described in this text before I have explained them to you.
From the water in which my speech and presence reside: when they crush your body as those of thighs and helper/assistant, do not think to draw it out nor remove from its source continuously flowing acrid waters that lead directly to death; have mercy on whoever enters therein. If you see someone inside, then heal them if possible within twenty days or thirty; otherwise, take no further action about it.
Captital .xx.: This line appears incomplete or potentially out of context
This medieval medical treatise fragment, written in a language that blends Latin with elements reminiscent of Italian and other Romance languages, seems to deal with the healing process for injuries such as joint pain or bone fractures
The above medieval medical text discusses the continuous curing of a joint (this may refer to healing cartilage in a fractured bone) at the site of mending from a break, predominantly near connections or junctures within the body's structure. It appears that care is essential for these areas as they are associated with movement and function which heavily relies on proper joint integrity – hence why it’suprahibido in keeping them well-maintained to preserve natural operation of a limb; restraint here implies careful attention or possibly immobilization techniques used by physicians.
Now consider if the nodulation is recent and administer those remedies that have stippedax arsecix aloen (this likely refers to certain plant or herb extracts), ashes, and mirrals applied herein for them; whether a few or all of these will soothe said pain in their area when taken steadily with food supplementation like egg yolk or bread paste. Place this mixture over the nodulation on cotton (or some other absorbent material) to compress it, and tightly bind around therein for good constriction.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Allow no extraction that day; and apply pressure on it or other like treatments until the swelling subsides; rest upon a layer of lead for its ability to draw out all the fluid accumulated in the limbs.
May it be that the knot has been transformed and tightened in this place, necessitating its cause to provoke the aforementioned condition, cut through such excess or protruding parts with precision, remove all superfluity as much as possible until it becomes soft (or reduced), thus ensuring proper drainage. Care for that which is healed within these constraints.
Capitol .xxi.: This line is difficult to interpret as it does
When the bone fracture heals and according to Roman law, be gentle with both subtlety of movement and frequency not exceeding nature's course.
When a bone fracture is healed, and restore the sensitive part of the body and limbs lightly: at which point it's not pain due to these causes—such as excessive tension in ligaments or joints that prohibits nutriment from flowing freely within; or an abundance of bandaging beyond necessity; or unnatural, rapid movements during one’s time (the proper hour); or swelling in the abdomen and displeasure.
Care for the excess water involves draining it from the body and making the heart tender within so that its self may multiply inwardly; apply washing, and introduce warmth and lubrication to it.
Ensure pressure is applied to the limb so that it draws nourishment back into its normal shape and form within or continues with body fluid seepage outside of itself until restoration occurs.
The provided text appears as though it is from an old medical treatise that comb
When the bones are broken and made rigid, it is forbidden to perform their operation at once.
When you heal the member that has tortuosity and elevation of the bone end (deformity) and entanglement, it is for form' sake; nevertheless, the body does not prohibit such natural operation from your intervention if someone else exists whose existence necessitthy this specific limb.
May also stand among the doctors and innkeepers, who have used our land for healing purposes; this operation is lost to great fear due to the reputation of what we are performing here.
If leg and joint stiffness are recent (newly occurring), then they may be caused by water retained in the area where their thighs touch, as there are soothing herbs that have been immersed in hot wine or vinegar; similar substances like honeycomb of acacia gum and oil from pomace fruit shall also be applied to this place for mollification (softening). Or it may involve the pus from a recent abscess, as well as flesh leeches that have been crushed into lard or olive oil; these will likewise be spread on said location. This refers to externally prepared concoctions known in apothecary literature for consolidating and strengthening medicines (internal remedies).
Some waters are soluble in the constant cold breeze that is on them and should be administered exercise for all parts of the body throughout the entire day.
May it rain today and be hard weather, whereby pain becomes stone-like and necessitates the use of iron for treatment; provided that the pus beneath their cecum has been expelled and bone dissolution continues, as excess fluid from this condition overflows beyond those openings, leading to interstitial ossification below them. And it is administered with ease under these circumstances in consideration of its solicitation due to study needs.

In discourse about dislocation." - Here, the sentence is likely referring to a discussion focused
Dislocation is an injury of any joint in one's body, preventing movement and requiring the intervention of a physician; it brings about great pain and serious injuries." - This translation explains that dislocation refers to damage at the juncture or where two bones meet (joint), which results in loss of mobility. It emphasizes both immediate medical attention required for such an injury, as well as its potential severity regarding associated intense pain and significant physical harm.
So when one suffers a dislocation, they must promptly perform the reduction; if not done quickly afterward, then it gets fixedated and greatly hinders attempting to reduce the dislocation." - Here we are directed towards an urgency in addressing dislocations. The translation underscores that immediate attempts at reducing (repositioning) a dislocated joint is crucial—delay can lead not only to complications but also make future reduction efforts more challenging and potentially less successful, suggesting the critical nature of timely medical response for such injuries in medieval contexts or settings where this treatise might have been applied.
So if one does not immediately immobilize or splint the area during reduction attempts, it leads to muscle cramps and persistent pain." - The translation communicates that there is a significant risk of complications following an injury like dislocation when proper immediate care measures—immobilization in particular—are neglected. It highlights how delaying these interventions can result not just from the original trauma but also induce additional symptoms such as
When you wash away the acidity (implying some form of treatment or medication), then ensure that you tighten up inside where it rests again after its healing phase; and secure your limb in water foot baths and oil, and reduce it for ease of movement.

When the detachment of it is little, then returns back by itself a little in its major positions.
If the dislocation is complete and finished, then make sure that reduction of it in this place occurs promptly without delay.

The reduction of a muscle strain or sprain often involves several steps aimed at realigning the affected area, reducing pain and inflammation,
Here's the translation for that sentence: The muscle is not dislocated but rather in three ways possible; one way being it has become dislocated at the moment of impact, or immediately afterward when movement occurs again (literally translated as "The muscle isn’t dislocated here. Rather there are possibly three methods by which this could be happening: either it's been dislocated upon an eventuality or shock force and also instantly post-movement").
The second possibility is that it has become dislocated from beneath the muscle, and this type of injury does not occur behind (near) shoulder joints or due to nerves issues directly associated with them—meaning sprains in these regions are less likely related to a hidden undermuscular origin. Here's how we can translate that line: The second possibility is it has become dislocated beneath the muscle, and this type of injury does not happen behind (near) shoulder joints or due directly to nerve problems—implying injuries in these areas are less likely related to something hidden within the muscle.
Mostly it is a hidden dislocation that occurs shortly after the traumatic impact and mostly in those parts where there are sparse bones—in these instances difficulty arises during examination; this can be challenging to identify, especially if movement of such areas causes further displacement. Here's the translation: Most commonly, it is a type of dislocation that becomes apparent shortly after experiencing trauma and predominantly in regions where there are fewer bones—in these cases diagnosing may prove difficult; this can be particularly challenging to identify if movement aggravates such areas further.
And when arsenic is applied to the bone through palpation or crushing, and the patient' extruded joints have been put back into place with caution because they are already displaced.
Now when you cry out that something has entered above and exceeded its limit, then proceed with the treatment of it.

If you wish to reduce this further: and make present herein a long home that is from there (the limb), and position it downward as far as possible, immediately inserting your muscle quickly between the swelling of the limb and lifting upwards what comes out below, while another servant withdraws fluid from beneath. May it be that the thigh is swolthy (swollen), and if there's another cause leading to its being suspended, then when we return this area back into place, it will become so again firmly positioned afterward.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And another method of treatment is as follows: place a long staff under his head with which he takes away figure (perhaps like a mortise and tenon joint), placing it quickly on top of the bedclothes at the end of the stick, so that neither its thickness nor subtlety should be present. The patient's limp is positioned over/under this long staff, with their malady remaining in line along the length of the staff; and they are stretched out body part by part for strength (of other parts), whereupon the joint returns to its proper place quickly due to speed or swiftness.
If reduction of it is difficult for all the reasons we have mentioned before, then use this treatment: grasp a stick with its length equivalent to two arm'se lengths and hold that at an angle of four digits from the tip of your thumb.

When food from excess humors in the body is stopped and rested upon the affected limb, it leads to healing for them.
And if food is given more and its exercise remains firm without softening upwards (presumably the body or parts of it), then already healed they will be.
May it be that if the joint is dislocated due to humidity experienced by them or for another reason, then in that case administer three kinds of treatments as mentioned in the book on medical procedures.
If all this pain is present and the ligament or joint isn'thy not closed for seven days, we will remove the bandage and stiffness sometimes over that place with a few movements; it cannot be fixed nor raised at arm segments below, you understand that these are nerves of him who reside in the head (muscle), either deeply seated or spread out thinly finely-tuned.

Care of hip dislocation: You understand that the knee joint is dislocated and seems difficult; it's generally displaced in all directions, especially between or behind parts (thigh), where even gentle pressure does not return it to its normal position until you can see how far out the bone has moved. When realignment of an externally dislocated hip occurs while moving someone who is injured: when adjusted back into place and stabilized as needed according to any shape in which displacement occurred, that indicates movement or contact with this joint cannot be made without severe effort because its structure becomes concave.
When you cover the wound, reduce the displacement as much as possible so that it heals with cauterization; if at all there is a need for cauterization, difficult to restore completely, and mainly when they are behind in other parts of dislocation, poison from all sources contributes greatly, causing continuous pain until death.
And when the restoration is possible—that is to say, that his body has been stretched out and extended by force (hands/arms), and the doctor's hands are on their hips or inside where they hold onto each other for support, pushing at the joint in question until it returns to its proper place.
If the dislocation occurs in the parts ahead (forward), then return your hand to its place where it touches the crotch of his palm upon contact with the thighs.
If dislocation does not obey reduction, then apply vigorous extension and strong motion.
When two ministers stretch out their arms, they hold that instrument between them to prevent it from being overextended.
When you turn his arm completely over, placing a long cloth or bandage on it, or using the cord.
When the doctor touches the joint with his hand, apply some oil to it so that these are the causes helping in its lubrication; and then press firmly on the joint until it returns (to normal).
Here the reduction of his body that is paused upon that layer in which he has contracture and effusion from bile stored up within its narrowing (stricture), with his arm hanging from the chest, being laid on pillows for days.
And thus if it is formed at its place in the joint, then cut that ligament and fasten therewith what belongs to it.
If you see the joint not strong and swolthy (thickened), then apply bandage and silk thread to it, leave it for several days until drawn out; afterwards remove that same thing.
May you apply gravity to the reduction of the joint, and its position is in movement, thus applying moistened poultice (wet compress) and gentle friction, until it has healed; or a pause at the hernia'supinant part, which is fatty tissue motion area; bind it up here, placing that same over bone during day and night. Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Inside of water bath wherein it is placed inside (or immersed).
If you wish to pause over that damp and split cow hole at the edge and stand on it, do so for some time, then that area becomes dry and returns to its proper disposition.

The bones of the body have been dislocated and their reduction is laborious; it may occur at other joints where movement speed during the moment of displacement leads to apatheia (numbness) or ankylosis fractures that require immobilization. (This translation conveys instructions on handling cases with multiple joint issues, emphasizing urgent reduction and potential complications like numbness.)
For the reduction of a dislocated limb is to hold it off above a table and extend it using those at hand—the physician places their hand or palm on top of impending joint, then pushes gently until it returns to its proper place. (This translation provides guidance for medical practitioners on how to manually perform the relocation process in an emergency situation.)
However if the palm is already against the chest, then hold them above a table with extension and reduction; but if dislocation preceded this positioning of hand on abdomen, place their own hands intrinsically over that spot to ensure physician'thy touch covers the impending joint—this way maintainer can manage it. (This translation clarifies procedures when medical practitioners must adjust themselves for optimal handling and treatment during a dislocation.)
And if it returns shortly, good be; but if not, that part will harden and become immovable; do not interfdig with its reduction anymore until the days have passed.
Even though the joint' extrication follows its curvature; and there is no cause related to malady, but rather it has been soothed and cannot be strengthened for any reason—know that your nerves have become twisted or spasmed, and only when properly cauterized with treatment will you provide some relief from the flow of humors.
So when they return feeling worse (malassemia), place the dressing we have applied upon them, and bind tightly for days; likewise cut their clothing off and exercise it to keep fit.
If the patient' extrinsic movements are ceased and pain occurs in their waist or thighs due to some gravity-induced pressure, then apply it with water flow (aqua cauda) and warm compresses (fricacio veguadas), until they recover.
In order to provide an accurate translation for "Capitol .xxix.,

Envelop the sinew above the thigh and tighten it with strong bands, extending its length to where you must secure the head; then bind those same bands around the patient's hips using their cushions as needed, securing them in place; and adjust all the bands so that they are fastened together on the other staff which holds up the feet.

The given text seems like an excerpt from a medieval medical treatise written
For the treatment of a hernia, it might be suggested in Old French or Latin (common for such
It is understood that the joint of the hip and the muscle do not necessarily bend together only when dislocated (indicating hernia), but also where smaller body parts are curved or concave, which you injure there as well. This indicates a recognition in medieval medical thought that areas with structural weaknesses may be prone to similar issues of injury and could relate symptoms observed elsewhere within the patient's anatomy due to such inherent predispositions rather than isolated incidents at just one site, like hernia (hip joint). The translation conveys a holistic view consistent with contemporary
The hip joint is dislocated according to four ways: at the divisions of bones (which could refer to fractures or other structural damages), in front parts, behind parts, above, and below—the same way hernias might present themselves through various points where there's a breach. This line expands on how dislocations can manifest not just at the primary site but potentially affecting surrounding anatomical structures as well. The medieval medical perspective here recognizes that injuries could have multifacdictional impacts beyond their immediate location, which
Most commonly it is at the divisions of bones (possibly referring to joints between them), and rarely above or below—this implies that dislocations involving hernias are more often localized near certain articulations, which suggests an understanding in medieval times about typical sites where such injuries might occur. The
The name of the dislocation at these joints is when you adjust the hump (possibly indicating an abnormal growth or malformation in this context), which was placed on top and pushed downward with pressure, making it impossible for that part to bend its knee using the tongue. Here, cauterization by a pinpointed instrument comes into play; after being inserted through the coyssa (hip area) directly onto the affected location—thereby correcting or stabilizing what's referred to as an apostema ('fixation'), possibly of some sort in this historical medical context. This translation suggests medieval treatment approaches using manual manipulation and external devices like cautery pins, emphasizing a hands-on aspect aligned with humoral theories where balance among bodily fluids was key for health—a notion that dislocations could affect the body’s equilibrium requiring both corrective action on affected structures as well as restoration of 'humoric' or internal harmony. The language used in this translation showcases not only a treatment strategy but also reflects an understanding (though possibly rudimentary by today's standards) that structural abnormalities and injuries could impact bodily functions such as limb movement
When that body which has been set out of alignment returns to its original position, it is because the accidents (or misfortunes) have opposed this displacement.
When the patient's dislocation spreads from above down to below and they cannot stand on their feet due to pain; urine is retained in them, and a pad (splint) for the leg is applied underneath it - then walk with crutches on your feet.
Here comes the sentence to translate: The name of that person who has a dislocation at the back parts is such that it cannot expand the sinew nor bend what can already be bent by him, and on his thighs there'se placed a short cushion while another serves them. Here also their joint (probably referring to affected limb) remains bound where needed.
May reduction of these spices for this dislocation is what you consider, and if the dislocation is old and ancient, then it has already been treated with what you administer here today according to its disposition; thus not all will be cured in that treatment alone. And therefore do not expect a complete recovery from just that intervention.
When the dislocation is recent and it'm one of the four types of dislocations, then take your tool to reposition that joint and extend it towards both limbs parts as well as their counterparts; carefully return this part on the right side and left side without looking for other treatments.
May it be so in this intervention, if the patient does not return to life swiftly, then have those preparing for you apply force and extend the cushion from where they are positioned quickly or slowly as needed; another will stretch that same aid over the underside of said cushion. Also deploy a stiff rope (or belt) across the waistband below them so it lies flat, with one attending to hold their hands securely and gently, while others place tender pressure on those points above where they are located; additionally have another person firmly grasping each end of that tight binding.
When there is extension from the leg towards the shoulder joint or vice versa between the thoracic and second vertebrae (shoulder blade), it indicates movement beyond these points of articulation.
And when their extension is complete within a period of time, until the humidity rises above its place on the ground and begins to wander downwards.
This particular kind of extension is characteristic throughout all four regions.
And if the dislocation returns due to water we have mentioned, then be careful (be on your guard); otherwise, it is necessary for all special waters that describe their own treatment of care.
In their own reduction, when dislocated and the malady is situated over its chest (its back), keep pressure on the ligaments between the head of the coyssa here where it meets the place from which limbs are extended; also extend the ligament in parts belonging to the shoulder joint down towards the point furthest along that part.
Return another minister with strong suction to the thighs of him/her and compress firmly on the hollow of the malady'se leg, which then returns to its own place.
This particular substance is for purulent inflammation, by which this member gets reduced and other species help as well.
May you be excused from this particular method of healing we are engaged in today; for the two legs at the base of our patient's spleen have already formed a strong bond with ligaments and bones on both sides, above and below them.
Whenever any part of the body is as long as four digits (or fingers), and when the hernia extends further than two digits in length, it implies a significant condition according to this treatise:
Return the hump (presumably referring to an abdomen or swolthy body part) placed on the head of the staff and positioned in such a way that it is above, as much like two braces from Earth's measure.
And order a strong youth to shorten the thigh's head, and have another young man suspended over him by the waist, with yet another boy applying force at his strengthened joint; thus when it returns quickly to its proper place:
In the reduction itself, when it dislocates to the posterior part, where the hump lies over the back according to what we have recommended in the abdominal jelly; and its ligaments are properly placed on the hollow of the hump and on the chest.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Each minister extends to its respective area, and the doctor holds his hand over the reduction according to art.
When the dislocation is at the joints ahead, then cover it with bandaging as instructed by medicine; and let your doctor'se palm rest on the affected groin area while another hand compresses that side of its counterpart around there until you reach the part where pain starts.
If the dislocation is at the joints behind, do not let the humors spread to the parts immediately below and rise onto the ground; where there are bumps that have been pressed down hard, if the thigh's width has also become dislocated from those joints, then it should be on its face and limbs extended outwards, without pain.
When compression is applied with a table over the location where pain occurs in the joint,
So when the reduction is complete, as indicated by—and you should not be afraid of calling it "the reduction," and that's what I shall refer to from now on; extend your thigh cushions (from here), after straightening out those bent ones, expand this position until such time as the limb corresponding to where compression was applied returns to its proper place. At this juncture, adjust the hips and pause expansively with a bandage that's thick enough so that the large does not protrude awkwardly in any of the parts; maintain it fixed for three days or four.
Return the ligaments and bandages, and compare one strap with another.
And if you see those contracted in position, then know that the dislocation is already fixed, and so let the humors move outwards.
If you see any cause of suppuration (infection), return and bandage that area according to your first dressing technique, and apply it again for three days.
Return that part of it, and let them walk on those few days until they are comfortable.
Given that this text appears as if it is from an old medical treatise
Regarding the treatment of a joint dislocation, here's the translation:
The joints are displaced according to three movements: they can be displaced from the parts behind and in front of them, but not towards the present direction.
The title of the dislocation is that you command the hump to apply its cushion at the thigh, and if it gets dislocated then understands so.
Here comes the full sentence to translate: And for the restoration of all limbs is that you make an incision in the groin area properly positioned so that, if possible, it extends over your cushion; attach both thighs together with their chest and pause the leg between those points. Then apply pressure on the navel using your palms, placing them there to prevent the intestine from protruding outward again into strengthened position by another servant extending his foot inside until the detachment returns to its proper place.
The English translation of each line from the medieval medical treatise is as follows:
Return the dressing that you have applied to it and attach it to the thigh'supon its cavity; apply these bandages for three or four days, and then remove them.
Not use the limb of walking for more than a few days until it is healed and comforted.
If your reduction of the intestine is considered necessary for you (the practitioner), then apply strong extension force on the ligaments described in the previous treatment narration concerning the joint'thy healing process.

Translation: "Sometimes the ankle becomes displaced due to intervention or because it has become misaligned between the bones, which is painful either in those joints or deep within." This medieval medical text suggests that dislocation of the ankle (talus) can occur spontaneously as a result of some form of treatment and furthermore may happen due to malalignment among the surrounding bones. The experience of this condition, which involves pain potentially present in either superfized joints or within deeper structures around them, highlights concerns for both immediate relief from discomfort

Translation: "Sometimes the treatment for returning to health requires yielding or giving up easily and being able to return quickly."
