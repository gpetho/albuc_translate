of the dislocation of the knee
The knee can be dislocated in three ways:
namely, inwards and outwards, and backwards;
and it does not dislocate forwards.
And the sign is that you ask the patient to bend their leg at the thigh, and if it does not bend at the thigh, you know that it is dislocated;
and the restoration of all of them is that you have the patient sit upright, and extend their leg if they can, and put your back against their face, and put their foot on your feet;
then take their knee in your palms, and pull between your fingers, then bend both sides of the knee strongly;
and another assistant extends their foot, until the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that they can bend their leg at the thigh easily;
and apply the plaster, and bind the leg to the thigh, and tie them together tightly for three or four days, then untie it;
and the patient should not exert themselves to walk, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not aligned, then the assistant applies strong traction, as we have described in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
