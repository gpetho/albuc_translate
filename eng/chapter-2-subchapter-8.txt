 CHAPTER EIGHT.
On the treatment of warts on the eyelids.
 These warts which occur on the eyelids are sometimes humid, sometimes dry.
You should hold them with forceps or a hook, and cut them away from the roots with a scalpel; then put powdered vitriol on the place.
If there is bleeding from them, cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery.
Cauterization of them after excision is best, for they often return when a part of their roots is left behind; but when they are cauterized the roots are burnt and they will not come back.
