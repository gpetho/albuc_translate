Chapter Sixteen on cutting the nail and the growth of flesh of the nail beds.	CHAPTER SIXTEEN. On incision of ungula and excrescence of the canthus.	0.7496748
The pterygium is of two types: either nervous, and it resembles a hard, thin membrane. Or it is non-nervous, resembling a solid white moisture; if iron touches it or you try to take it with a hook, it breaks apart and a hook will not hold in it.	Ungula occurs in two forms: either the nervous, which resembles a fine hard membrane; or the non-nervous, like a white congealed humidity; which, when the iron touches it or you try to pick it up with a hook, is cut through and the hook has no hold on it.	0.78273165
Both types begin from the greater canthus, and they slowly creep until they cover the pupil and obstruct the light and the movement of the eye.	Both kinds grow from the greater angle of the eye, whence they spread little by little until they cover the pupil and block both the vision and the movements of the eye.	0.8382982
The method of its removal is that the patient places his head in your lap, then he opens his eyes, and you lift the eyelid with your hand, then you grasp the pterygium with a slightly curved hook and pull it upwards. Then you take a needle and insert into it a hair from the mane of a horse or a cow and a strong thread, and you bend the tip of the needle slightly, and you insert it into the middle of the pterygium and pierce it with the needle, and you tie the pterygium with the thread and pull it upwards. And you peel with the hair the side of the pterygium that is next to the pupil, as if you are sawing it with the hair to its end.	This is the method of incision: the patient places his head in your lap and opens his eyes; then you raise the lid with your hand; then with a gently curved hook pick up the ungula and pull it upward; then take a needle threaded with a horse hair or an ox hair, and a strong thread; slightly curve the end of the needle; then thrust it into the middle of the ungula, piercing it with the needle; and tie the ungula with the thread and pull upwards; and, with the hair, peel the side of the ungula adjoining the pupil, and divide it with a sawing motion right through.	0.90051854
Then you cut the remainder at the base of the canthus with a fine scalpel or small scissors and leave the natural flesh of the canthus, lest constant tearing result from its cutting.	Then what is left in the root of the angle cut out with a fine scalpel, or with small scissors; and leave the natural caruncle in the canthus lest, in cutting it away, a chronic flux of tears occur.	0.8449524
And you may pull the pterygium with the hook alone or with the thread as we have said, then you peel with the smooth scalpel the edge which this is its picture:	The ungula may be drawn out with the hook alone or with the thread as we have said, and scraped away with the smoothtipped scalpel of this form.	0.7289689
And beware that the scalpel touches the cornea, causing a hernia in it, so the pupil swells.	But beware lest the scalpel touch the corneal covering and cause a fissure in it and the pupil protrude.	0.7611603
Then, after the incision, put in the eye some powdered salt or some zinc sulfate suppositories and leave it until the next day, then treat it as needed until it heals.	Then after the incision put into the eye a little powdered salt or an eye-lotion of verdigris, and leave it till the following day; then treat as may be necessary till it heals.	0.8187701
If the pterygium is not fleshy and you are unable to insert a needle in it, nor fix a hook in it, then this type of pterygium is often treated with medications and heals as described in the classification.	If the ungula is non-nervous in origin and you cannot transfix it with a needle nor get a hook to hold fast in it, this sort is often successfully treated by medical means. So treat as described in the section.	0.7000772
And if you want to excise it, open the patient's eye and take a fine, smooth scalpel with a weak edge, in this manner: Gently scrape the pterygium from above. If you see that it becomes loose and crumbles, and the scraping has had an effect on it, then immediately instill into the eye some copper sulfate collyrium, or red collyrium, or powdered salt.	So treat as described in the section. But if you prefer to cut it, open the patient's eye, and take a fine smooth scalpel, rather blunt, like this and with this gently scrape away the ungula from above; and if you see that it is crumbling away and breaking down under the scraping, then immediately instil into the eye some eye-lotion of verdigris, or the red eye-lotion, or a little powdered salt, and bind the eye up till next day.	0.80220747
Then repeat the procedure until it is all gone. Unless a hot swelling appears in the eye, then leave it and treat the hot swelling until it heals.	Then repeat the operation on it till you have removed it all, unless an abscess forms in the eye, in which case cease the operation and treat the abscess till cured.	0.853768
Then repeat the scraping procedure on it until it heals.	Then repeat the treatment with the same scraping till healed.	0.8227221
As for a fleshy outgrowth of the conjunctiva, if the outgrowth harms the eye excessively, then grasp that outgrowth with a hook and cut off some of it. Do not cut too deeply, lest it cause excessive tearing.	As for a protuberance of flesh in the angle, if it causes great hurt pick it up with a hook and cut part of it away, with not too big an incision lest there be a flux of tears.	0.78940666
Then instill into the eyes red collyrium or copper sulfate collyrium until it heals.	Then into the canthus instil red eye-lotion or lotion of verdigris till healed.	0.7957971
