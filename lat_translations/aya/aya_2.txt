Praefatio.	Preamble.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have completed for you the book, Son, of what is last in science and medicine with its supplement, and having finished it from its explanations and declarations, I found it necessary to complete it with this treatise which is part of surgery, that is, of the art of the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since the operation with the hand is set down in our region and at our time entirely private: until perhaps the science of it has perished, and its track has been lost: and there remain of it only a few descriptions in ancient books, which have been modified by hands: and it has happened to them error and hesitation, until their intentions have been closed and its meaning has been extended: It has seemed to me that I should make clear it with the arrangement of this treatise according to two things, that is to say, according to explanation and declaration, and abbreviation: and that I should bring to light with forms of tools Cauteries, and the rest of surgical instruments: for as much as it is necessary to add a declaration and to proclaim its proper meaning.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	Because of the reason that a good artisan with his hand is not found in our time: for the art of medicine is long and an author needs to be exercised before it in the science of anatomy which Galen tells of, until he knows the joints of limbs, and their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, and nerves, and vessels, and their numbers, and their expansion, and beating pulse, and quietness, and places of departure.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And for this reason Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with work it is little, especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	But we have already spoken about him at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since who is not aware of that which we have said about anatomy, does not clear up, but falls into error, in which men fall by forming themselves from this science, and boast of it without knowledge and without experiment.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What is, for I saw a dull physician strike an escrofulous apophelitic patch on the woman's neck, and he struck some blood vessels in the neck: why did the woman's blood flow until she fell dead between her hands?
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another physician who assumed that he would extract a stone from the man's genitals, which had been causing him trouble for a long time, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So he went to him, and with a twig of holly he extracted it himself.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Why did the man die on the third day?
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the great size of the stone, and the condition of the nurse, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician who was taking a fee from the Duke of our land for medicine: and there happened to be a black eunuch with him, who was sitting by his side, and he broke the bone in his thigh near the heel; and the doctor persisted in his ignorance, and he bound the fracture to the shin with strong strands of thread, and did not cease from the wound's discharge.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he set him free according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Then he dismissed him after a few days and commanded him not to loosen the bonds; and he stood thus until his leg and foot were withered away, and came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	So I was called to him: and I eased the bonds; and there followed a time of peace, and he was free from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the corruption had already been confirmed in the member; and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	So then the corruption ceased to walk in the member until it died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician who pierced an escrofulous ulcer; and it was ulcerated for some days, until the disease of it was magnified with his lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	What is, for when it is a pure cancer from melancholy humors, then one should not approach it at all with iron, unless it be in a member that can bear it, so that it may be cut off entirely from it.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for this reason, I tell you, it is necessary for you to know that surgery is divided into two parts: that is, the operation which is associated with salvation and the operation with which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already aroused in all places of this book, where surgery has come, in which there is terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Why is it necessary for you to be careful of that, and to avoid it: so that you do not find a stupid ear when speaking and dishonoring.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore take a measure with care and protection, and bring the sick of you with ease and firmness, and use a better way, which is led by the grace of God to salvation and a worthy succession: and remove terrible diseases difficult to heal: and remove your souls from that which makes you afraid, so that it enters upon you a hesitation in your faith and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it remains more remaining to our glory, and sublime in the world, and lastly to the quantities of you.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galenus has already said in some of his advice.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not heal bad health: do not name yourself a doctor of evil.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	I have already divided this treatise into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter one.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Chapter one. On the caution with fire, and the caution with acute medicines, raw materials, and the order from the head to the feet, and the shapes of instruments, and tools: and whatever is necessary in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Chapter two. On section and perforation, phlebotomy and wound-binding, and ulcers: and extraction of arrows, and similar things: and all the chapter in order from the shapes of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration and dislocation, and cure of twists, and similar things: chapter in order from the head to the feet, and the shapes of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory be to God alone.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	Book of Surgery by Albucasis.
Pars I.	 Liber chirurgicus parva faciendum est. 1. De oculis et auribus et naso et maxillo et dentibus 2. De manu et pedibus 3. De sinus maxillae et ethmoideis et sphenaene 4. De fracturis. 5. De venosis et arteriais. 6. De venis. 7. De nervis et tendinis 8. De osse bus et artichitis 9. De ulceribus 10. De morbis internis. Pars II. 1. De partibus corporis humani. 2. De motu musculorum. 3. De ossibus et cartilagineibus. 4. De tendinis et ligamentis. 5. De venosis et arteriae. 6. De nervis. 7. De viscis innominatis. 8. De uteri et uterinus. 9. De vaginae. 10. De mastite.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Pars III. 1. De venitis. 2. De ulceribus. 3. De morbis externis. 4. De fracturis, cum cauterio. 5. De motu colli. 6. De pedum calceatione. 7. De iuuventi et senescenti.
Caput I.	De Ijuamento: 1. Si cu ferro, densis in clypeum ferri, et adstante aurice, naso, maxillo, dentibus, ut in iuuamento, cauterium facias. 2. Si uel auro, densis in clypeum auri, et adstante, sicut supra. 3. Si in pedem calceatione, in pedem cum calceatiis densis, et adstante, sicut supra.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	4. Si in maxillo aut in oris circumdatione, aut in auribus, aut in naso, aut in dentibus, aut in labris, aut in oris interiori, aut in laringe, aut in glottta, aut in uvulis, aut in vobis qui estis medici, scitote complexiones quae ad iuuamenta et nocumenta pertinentia: 5. Si in maxillo, aut in dentibus, aut in labris, aut in oris circumdatione, aut in laringe, aut in glottta, aut in uvulis, aut in vobis qui estis medici, scitote complexe
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	6. Si in manu aut in pedi, aut in lacu stigi, aut in vulvo femini, aut in vagina, aut in utero, aut in uterine, aut in labiis virili, aut in oris circumdatione, aut in oculis, aut in auribus, aut in naso, scitote complexe: 7. Si in manu, aut in pedi, aut in lacu stigi, aut in vulvo femini, aut in vagina, aut in utero, aut in uterine, aut in labiis virili, aut in oris circumdatione, aut in oculis, aut in auribus, aut in naso, scitote complexe: 8. Si in motu musculorum, aut in ossibus, aut in cartilagineibus, aut in tendinis, aut in ligamentis, aut in osse bus, aut in artichitis, scitote complexe: 9. Si in venis, aut in arteriis, aut in nervis, aut in viscis innominatis, scitote complexe:
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Also, many wise men spoke and disagreed with each other, and indeed a little of their speech is enough for me, fearing prolongation.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I therefore say that cauterization is universal for all complexions, which are with substance and without substance; excepting two complexions, which are a warm complexion without substance and a dry complexion without substance.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In a warm and dry complexion with substance they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some have said that cauterization is helpful in this one.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others have said the opposite of this, namely that cauterization is not appropriate in a disease that is of heat and dryness: for fire's nature is hot; and it is inappropriate, as it will heal a disease of hot and dry from hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite of this said: "By cauterization a benefit is brought about in all diseases of heat and dryness that occur in human bodies": for when you compare the human body with its humidities to the complexion of fire, you will find the human body cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I myself say by his speech: for from experiment I have discovered that sometimes.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not necessary to make a comment on that, unless one has already been proved and exercised in the exercise of the last chapter of cauterization, and has known the difference between complexions and the various diseases in themselves, and their causes and accidents, and the course of time for them.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	However, there is no danger for you from the other complexions, especially in cold and moist diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	Now all physicians have come to an agreement on them, and they have not disagreed about the benefit of cauterization with them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, children, that the secret of the cure by fire and the goodness of it when it is combined with medicine while burning is this: for the fire is simple, and its action does not reach unless to the member that is cauterized; and it does not hurt another connected member unless with little harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The truth is that the action of burning leads to that which lengthens from the members: and perhaps it causes difficulty in the healing of a member, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire because of its own subtlety and beauty of its substance, does not do that, unless it is in excess.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	I have indeed made it known to you through experimentation, because of the length of its use and study with art, and its position on truthfulness of things: and through it I excuse the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not, because it is not permitted to my book, I would bring you a secret and mystery in fire, and the quality of its action in its expulsion of bodies, which expels sickness with a philosophical demonstration, which is increased by the minds of your scholars.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And you sons, know that they differ in time when the cautery should be made, and put a better time for the wine.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that the cautery should be made at any time: therefore, because the accident that happens is hidden by the time, it is attracted with the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary pains, strong pains, festivities, which do not tolerate delay: because they are afraid of them, that mischief happens, which is greater than a small harm that does not cross due to time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not fall into the minds of your scholars or sons that they do not consider, unless they are common and stupid doctors, that is, that they think that the sickness which is healed by cautery is always a return: and they put that consequence, and the thing is not as they think: because cauterization is not, except in the place of medicine, which changes the complexion, and dries up the humidities that are causes, because of which pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	But the cautery is superfluous over medicine by the speed of its own power and the virtue of its operation, and the dominance of its own: and it is possible that it should bring back sickness at some time according to the complexion of the nurse, and the location of his sickness, and the virtue of it: and that it is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluity in it: and that it achieves it by means of acquisition from food, and similar things from causes, unless there is sickness, in which cautery is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	The slight illness in a few members that are superfluous, and the moisture, such as the tooth cautery because of the pain, and similar to it, is possible that that pain does not return in it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But this fits in with the few.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But this word of the ulegy again, which is the last medicine, is a straight word: not to that what they intend in it: because they believe that there is no therapy that brings with it medicine, nor with another after the occasion of the cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the thing is the opposite of his and the intent, that the cautery is the last medicine, is not, unless when we administer ways of cure in some diseases, and do not bring those medicines: then we administer at the end of this matter a cautery, and it brings forth: so it falls that the cautery is the last medicine of the doctor, not according to the intention which the vulgar and many-sighted doctors understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	But the ancients said that the cautery with gold is better than the cautery with iron: and they did not say this, except for the equality of gold, and the limitation of its substance: and they said that it does not make a place of pus cauterize.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But this is not at all: for I have already tried this, and I found that it does not do so in some bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And the cautery with itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	But when you ignite the fire of cautery from gold, it does not appear to you, when it is ignited according to the quantity that you use, because of the redness of gold: and when it comes to its coldness, and if you add to it ignition, it melts in the fire, and turns into leaves.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Why does the craftsman fall from this work: and because of that it is made Cautery with iron with us faster and nearer, according to the straightness towards the action.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I have already arranged this Chapter in the Cauterium, according to the Chapters; and I have arranged it from the head to the feet, that it may be more easily found by him who seeks it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	The way of cauterizing the head in the crown-commissure.
Caput II.	Chapter Two: The Head.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Here is the cauterization to the dominion of humidity and coldness upon the brain: which are two causes of sweat, and of a multitude of the flux of humours out of the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and of a multitude of sleep, and of pain of the teeth, and of pain of the throat: and universally all sicknesses, which happen from coldness, such as paralysis, and swelling, and epilepsy, and apoplexia, and similar things from those ailments.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The mode of cauterization is, that you should wash the sick-person: to empty the head by means of a fluid medicinal preparation which cleanses and purifies it; three times, or four times, according to the exigencies of the strength of the illness, and his age, and his custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then command him to wash his head with water.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands so that he has placed his own hands upon his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your hand upon the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	And whichever way your middle finger moves, mark that spot with a brand.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then light the cauterizing fire of olive oil: which has this shape.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place the person himself upon the marked spot with the brand, pressing his hands slowly down, and you shall roll him.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then light your hand quickly, and see the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see already a quantity of the hair of the head, or a quantity of the herbs, then light your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the iron, or with another one if it grows cold: until you see the bones which I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take a little salt, and dissolve it in water, and dip it in the same, and put it on the place: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then put on the place the dip in butter, and leave it until the wound is healed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for that with the ointment of four drugs, until he is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	I have said, that as long as a wound remains open, it will discharge pus; why then is it better and more beneficial to dress it freely?
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said, that the skin should be causticated down to the jaw: and the cautery should be held until a certain hard substance of bone is burned up.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then the wound should be washed after that which has been burned from the bone, then dressed.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say, that it is necessary to make an impression with the cautery on the last part, until it enters the jaw a little, so that the bone is broken, which takes place like the shape of a key: or the instrument which women put in a pot with water: and they say, that vapours rise from this place and the open wound is healed in a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then dress it with the cautery until it hardens.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But these two kinds of cautery do not seem to me at all, unless among some people for fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And leave it, in my opinion, is better with the health of that person.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by continuous solution of its natural substance: as we have testified in the other members: and especially when the head is weak in nature: and the species of cautery first is more healthy and better with me, and I use it: so then work with that when healthy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	The mode of causticing the head when in pain throughout all the head.
Caput III.	Head 3.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When there is a chronic pain throughout the head: and it is prolonged in a sick person, and uses hyoscyamus, and rubs, and caps, and oils, and employment of poultices.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one fire, which we have described, and there is nothing of those things left: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head is wounded and of strong constitution, and is not weak, and a severe cold comes upon it: then cauterize with another fire beneath it slightly.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize himself on all the horns of his head with the fire we have described, and let not the skin be touched, and a quantity be taken from the bone, as we have mentioned.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize himself with one fire in the back of his head, in a place which is called a vein; and this is a place where a flowing [blood] comes out: and wash your head well in this, and do not discover the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For it is because of this that a severe pain comes upon him, and is far removed from the pain of all other head cauterizations.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will call this a Cauterization in its place: and it should be that a cauterization which is sharp  [should be used] where the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of the head with a subtler fire, which cauterizes the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	Regarding the way to cauterize in a headache, as much with the medicine as with the iron.
Caput IIII.	Head 4.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When it happens to a pain in a part of the head and a soda, or the pain extends all the way to the eye, and is washed away with cleansing medicines, and the rest of the treatment is given, as I have mentioned in the division of diseases, and does not leave all of this: then cauterization in it is according to two ways: either cauterization with a sharp fire burning while administering: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	But a Cauterization while the sharp fire burns while administering: it is, as you take one tooth of the other, and scrape it out, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut out the place of pain at a time when the phlebotome is standing by, until it does become in it a place under the skin, where the blood is drawn.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Intromitte ergo eum in ipso subcute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitte ulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do this with some medicines burned, which I wrote in the twelfth treatise, On Burning Medications.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	The cauterization of it with iron, however, is according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Of fire, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a clavis: because the form of the head is like the form of a key, in which there is some curve, and in the middle of it is a small eminence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then put the iron on the spot and keep your hand: and you shall turn the iron little by little with velocity: and let the quantity that is burned be of the thickness of the skin, as a half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand so that it is not burned the artery which is below, and does not happen a flow of blood.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then dip the cotton in salt water and put on the spot, and leave it for three days: then dip the cotton in butter: afterwards cure with ointment until healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this headache with a sharp knife, second time of cauterization.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And caue not from the incision of the artery in this headache, not old nor proper.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	The mode of cauterizing in an old headache.
Caput V.	Head, part five.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you cure a headache, with what we have said before in the preceding cure, and what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and is not sufficient to this what we have said from cauterizing first with medicine, or with cauterizing with fire, then you shall put the fire of Cauterium cuttle, until it becomes white after having signs on the spot of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or almost so: and set your hand down with force, and squeeze it until you hit the artery, and reach all the way to the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	Indeed, you must take care to avoid the continued pain of the jaw, which moves when chewing, from affecting the side or the nerve that moves it, from where the spasm occurs.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be careful and vigilant about the flow of blood from the artery, which has been severed.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For there is a great fear in the disconnection of it, and especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is not diligent or skilled: and he suspends the operation with it at first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come to remind you of the treatment of the flow of blood from an artery as a second mode, and in the place of this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	That if you see from sickness that it is not sufficient for this cautery, and you see the body with a wound that accepts the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have told you, care for the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you see, administer the cautery that we have said in the chapter on extracting an artery with a cautery tool having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cauterization is better this way and confers more benefits.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	On the method of cauterizing in ear pain.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and is treated with poultices, and the remaining treatment as we have said in the division, and the pain does not go away, then apply fire-cauterization: and that is what is called a "punction," whose shape is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then the punctures with it after its ignition around the whole ear, as it is relieved: or around either of them if the pain is simultaneously on both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And extend it with the cautery from the root of the ear somewhat, after you have marked the places with the caustice: and let the amount of cautery be ten points throughout the whole ear, and almost as many.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then care for the place, until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	On the method of cauterizing in torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Tortura quæ curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciesbus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in divisionibus aegritudinum.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And the separation of cauterization by species which occurs from drying and spasm of nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this species of torture with hyoscyamus, and caustics, and gargarisms, and your treatment does not bring about a cure, then you should cauterize the disease in three places: one at the root of the ear, and second slightly below its time, and third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery on the opposite side of the weak part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Since softening does not occur except in the part which appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the shape of the cautery is such that it cauterizes itself directly at the extreme tip of the upper ear below the hairline: and another in time: whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cautery on it until half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the shape of the cautery, and its species is from a blade whose preceding form is: however, it is not so fine as you see: and it should be a little blade in it with some excess thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then care for the place, with what precedes it: until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	The way to cauterize in ancient apoplexia.
Caput VIII.	Head
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When ancient apoplexia is established and you treat it with what we have said, and your treatment does not bring about a cure, and the person has no fever, then you should cauterize him with four cauteries on all the corners of his head, and one in the middle of his head as we have said, and one at the back of his head, according to what preceded: and the shape of the cautery is according to what preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	Also cauterize with the cautery on the jaw: and it is more last.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then treat it with what preceded it.

Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then rub the whole head with oil of olive, and place over his scalp a plaster of syphilis described in the treatise on plasters: and apply it sometimes.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This is the method of cautery: and do it according to the order given above.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	But if he recovers by means of it, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	But if he does not recover: then apply to his posterior part of the head three cauterizations, which are descending from the upper part of the head all the way down to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cauterization a thick layer of oil.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then care for the cauterizations, with what preceded it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	But if you wish to add something, and the patient can bear it: then apply to him a cauterization in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	That if you wish to add something: then cauterize him over two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then care for the patient until he recovers: and let the cauterization be with oil according to the form given above.

Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then rub the head with oil for purification: then apply to him a cauterization in the middle of the head, and one over each horn of the head, and three over the posterior part of it, and two over the spinal cord.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	But if the patient is not comfortable with softening of his whole body, and he can bear it, but his illness is strong: then apply to him four cauterizations over the spinal cord, and the last with a cauterization while burning his skin until it comes out entirely, and wash your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for him, until he is healed; and so cauterize with olive oil.

Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore let the wounds of his brain be first washed with hyssop and with the other remedies we have mentioned: when he is very sick, or bears up poorly to the reception of medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	But if he is a boy who does not bear up to the medicines, then let him have a gargle and tooth cleaning that purifies the brain, these many days before the good feeling returns.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then wash his head well, and then cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of his head, according to the method we have described: and with another cautery behind, and on all the ridges of his head.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	If he is strong and bears up, then cauterize him with the methods I have described for having paralysis, and for softening the body above the vertebrae of the neck, and those of the back: and let the cautery be olive oil according to the method already mentioned.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is excessive withdrawal from the world into melancholy, and his body is wet with湿: then give him in a drink what purifies his brain, according to the method we have described: then wash his head well, and then make a loop of linen folded twice, like a circle.

Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Make him sick once a week with some medicine while maintaining the rest of his treatment good until he is healed.

When you see the beginning of water in his eye through the signs which I mentioned in the distribution, then begin and drink with him while he washes his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And keep him away from all moisture, and make him sit in a bath, on some days on an empty stomach.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then tell him to scrub his head, and burn him in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then burn him on both temples with two caustic substances, if the descent of water is in both eyes at the same time: or from one side, if the descent of water is in only one eye: and cut off all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the caustics be long in width.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see anything of that, then cut it off right away with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in extracting the arteries, and cutting them off, and taking care of the flow of blood.

When the tears of the eyes are old and persistent, and they flow over the eyelids and the arteries that lie on the outside of the head, it is because of the cold humor and the phlegmatic one; then cauterize with the same cautery that I mentioned at the beginning of the flowing water, with a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries over the two temples, and two cauteries on the top of the skull under the two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if there is an increase with the addition, then cauterize it in all sides with careful eye, on the end of the brow with a small cautery.

And if there is water, then cauterize it above the two eyelids with two cauteries on all parts: and let them be stretched from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the brow: and do not move your hand away from the cautery, but second by second according to the amount that is burned, the third eyelid.

Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they are even and grown, then place the sick person's head in your lap: and then mark on the eyelids of his eyes withencausta, a mark that is according to the figure of the leaf of mistletoe: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hair.

Then set fire to the cautery on the figure that you marked slowly with many stokes, until all the surface of the skin is burnt away, which is like the shape of the leaf of mistletoe, whole appears complete in itself.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the mark of health of your work is this: that if you shut the eyelids of the eye and remove the hair near the place where it hurts.

Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While he persisted in this, that which himself discovered as to the tingling, then dismiss the medicine, and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When the tingling ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And consider then, if you see the eyelid uplifted, as though it were uplifted by contraction with fire, or with an incision, is good: and if not, then repeat upon it from the medicine upon a spot where it impresses not, and does not mar, until your operation has equated it, and the eye closes.

Prescribe to the sick person that he should place his head in your lap, and hold it between your hands so that it does not move or shake while you are performing the cauterization.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then put the coturnic infusion on his eyeball or on the mucus of the psyllid; then apply the cautery, which is of this form.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	It should be made into a tube, like the feather of a penknife at one end, which is to be used as a cautery; and if the knife goes down to the other end, and if the knife is held up so that it sways:
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this tube is better suited for your purpose.

Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold the eye, a little away from the cautery from the side of the nose, so that your hand does not move or shake the sick person; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and break it up.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If then you put the tip of your cautery all the way to the nose, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then apply the cautery once or twice more, if you can stand it; and then let it go for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then put on the poultice with butter, and cure yourself with the drying ointment, until it heals.

And pour into it a quantity of liquid lead, and hold your hand with the cannula so that it does not move at all, so that it does not run, or so that the liquid lead does not reach his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And you should put on a poultice over his eye for an infirm person in milk of dates, or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a wonderful cure.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula heals, along with what we have said about cauterization and cure, it is good.

And if you want, dip the hair, or a knife in cold butter, and place it on the painful tooth: and place an iron heated red-hot on it, until the fire reaches the depth of the cavity of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	But the cautery with fire is, that you direct the air pipe, or the iron pipe.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And remain in his body some grossness, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the mouth weak.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then light the fire-cauterization, of whose shape you have made; and place it on that tooth: and hold your hand, until the cautery cools down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do it sometimes, for the pain will be relieved, or in that very day, or in another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary to impress the cautery on it, that he may fill his sick mouth with good butter, and hold it for an hour: then let him spit it out.

Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When it happens in the throat a pain from cold and moisture, or from a thick wind, until it comes out of its own skin with natural exit of waste, and cure the sick with that which I have said, and it does not benefit to him: then it should be laid down on his chest his back, and three cauterions according to this form, and this quantity the same over the neck below the hypocondrium, where the bed is reached by man: and there should be space that is between each cautery according to its thickness, a finger: and there should be a cautery according to the length of the body, straight: and do not squeeze your hand with the cautery much.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let there be a quantity of that which is heated by the thickness of the skin, a quantity of its half not added; and let the sick stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	But if he is not standing, then let him lie down, for he has already extended his limbs and raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the operation.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And you may also be able to do this cautery with a scalpel when there is subtlety and wisdom with you in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And guard yourself, so that you do not proceed too far in the cauterization, and the thickness of the skin is heated throughout, for it is heated throughout the body, and it reaches the intestines: because the skin is there thin, so know that one.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	On the mode of cauterizing the liver pustules.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When it comes to the exit of the liver pustules, and you wish to know, if that pustule is in the liver meat, or in its lining: then, if it is in the liver meat, you will see a pain that weighs down, and there is no acuteness: and if it is in the liver lining, with a sharp pain: and you will see that the treatment of doctors fatigues him.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore let the sick person lie down on his chest.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then, the figure of the place of the pustule with the caustic: then, the fires of the cautery that it absorbs by radiation.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with that same cautery, until the skin is completely burned over, and it reaches the syphac, until it comes out completely: then take care of his treatment for the treatment of pustules, until he is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary that this cautery be used at the sight of one who has been studying the art of medicine for a long time: and through whose hands some diseases have sometimes passed with experimentation: for then let him dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But, in my opinion, it is better to leave it alone.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	If the pleural cavity is to be cauterized...
Caput XXXI.	Caput XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancient ones said that they used the roots of aristantho to cauterize the pleura in a cold manner according to this method...
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And you should obtain the dry roots of aristantho, one long root which is found there, and make it as thick as a finger...
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil: and set it alight on fire...
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cauldron between the clefts of the collarbone and two small ones under the chin a little to one side, which is under the beard...
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And two more cauldrons in the middle of the chest, a little to one side, and another one below the stomach, and another above the stomach...
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauldrons from behind: one in the middle of the two ribs: and two cauldrons on either side of the chest, lower cauldron which is between the two ribs...
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And you should not compress your hand with the cauldron, but rather let it hang out so that it smells bad...
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancient people said that they used to use an iron cauldron of similar size: and set it alight, and put it inside the body between the ribs until it had reached the appendage, and brought out pus, as we have said before in the description of the liver...
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this piercing with the cauldron there is a fear that either the weak one immediately dies, or a fistula occurs at the place, which cannot be healed...
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	On the splenectomies...
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you are treating the spleen disease, as we have said before in the division of the diseases, and if your treatment is not effective, then cauterize it according to three methods which are all correct...
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of these is that you make three cauldrons, or four in a line according to the length of the spleen according to the shape of the caulteries of the liver, which preceded this figure...
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And be between all cautery quantity of thickness of the digit, or more a little.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And be the mode of cauterization, which we said in the cauterization of the liver equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	 And do not compress your hand with the cautery: and let the patient lie on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	 And another mode of cauterization is: that the fire of the cautery has two edges, which we said in the chapter on shoulder dislocation: and raise up the skin, which is in direct splenis, where it reaches the bed of the sick on the left side: and let your elevation be as you raise up the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauterization falls according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then introduce two hot edges, until you pierce the skin from the other side: then remove the cautery: so there are four cauterization.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	 And if you wish to cauterize with a cautery having three edges.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then the care of the cauterization after you have sent it off to emit pus after many days: for indeed it is more effective that which remains behind from the cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	The mode of cauterizing in Hydropsis.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not fall in Hydropsis, unless it is properly raised up.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you cure Hydropysis with the modes of cure which we have said in the division, and there is no cure, then it is necessary that you cauterize the umbilicus four times, and one cautery on the stomach, and another on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two behind the back between the vertebrae, and one directly in the chest, and one directly in the stomach: and be the thickness of the cauterization close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then remove the open cautery, that it may emit pus after a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not wet the sick man with the cure after the cautery with it: for it is necessary that there be two intentions against it, and will hasten to the cure with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	Form indeed the cautery with which cauterized is the gut, be closed: for the form of it; and his with which cauterized is the back, be oiled: for the form of it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et crura.
Caput XXXIIII.	De modo cauterizandi pedes, et crura.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they are put into the hydropeatic, and fill with yellow water: it is necessary that you cauterize on the back of the foot in the nocrati, which is between the auricular and the ring: and oil your hand with the cautery, and do not twist him: then oil your hand: and do not return to him at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the water is yellow, and set the cautery according to this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then do on the two legs the two cauteries in all the leg, and let the cautery be made with the extreme of the knife-edge of the cautery: and make the cautery according to the length of the leg, one under the knee, and the other lower than that, about in the middle of the leg: and on all the back the two cauteries: and do not let the cautery be closed without a long time of curing: so that it resettle from it some water: then cure yourself with the rest.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	De modo cauterizandi in solutione ventris.
Caput XXXV.	De modo cauterizandi in solutione ventris.When you are curing in the solution of the belly, you must be careful not to go beyond the form that is indicated: for if you go further, it will produce an opening, and then there will be a great danger of peritonitis; and it will be necessary to wait until the wound has cicatrisated, before going on with the cure.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the solution of the belly is from cold and moisture, until the virtues of retention and digestion, which are in the stomach and intestines, have weakened; and cure it with the methods of curing, and do not heal: and you will see one that tolerates the exuberant virtue of cauterization, then cauterize yourself with a large cautery on his own belly, according to what has gone before in the cauterization of the stomach with a small cautery, and four small cauteries around the navel, with a small cautery: and a cautery above the alhosos with a large one, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see abundant humidities and the sick one tolerating it, then cautery him with cautery on the chest and cautery on all the iliacs: and perhaps you have added two small cauteries near the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For cure is perfect, whose remedy does not err.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	(On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.)
Caput XXXVI.	CHAPTER III. ON THE CAUTERIZATION OF HEMORRHOIDS.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	(When there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are of thick humor, cold, or corrupt humors, and this treatment, which we have mentioned in the division, does not help, then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower part of the back of the loins under an almond-shaped triangle somewhat, and cautery under the navel almost like two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you consider that his stomach is cold, and his food is not digested, and you see his face pale, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, according to what has preceded: and cautery on the small intestine, and another on his spleen, with a cautery on the claw: and leave the cautery open at times: then take care of him, until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	(On the method of cauterizing the arterioles after their ligation.) Caput XXX.
Caput XXXVII.	CHAPTER III. ON THE CAUTERIZATION OF ARTERIOLA после их лигатур. (The head of Chapter III contains the text you provided, but with a different organization and additional details) In primis, curiis colligamus utrum in vasis sanguinis ad arterioles uel ad venulas sunt: si enim ad arteriolas, tunc cum cauterio super pedem arteriae lygamo: si uel ad venulas, tunc cauterimus cum cauterio super pedem venuli.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	We first examine whether they are in a vessel of blood to arterioles or veins: if to arterioles, then with cautery on the edge of the artery; if to veins, then we cauterize with cautery on the edge of the vein. And when you cut off the arteriole, then you light the cautery as it radiates.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the cautery into the cut arteriole: and with your last hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood runs: make it once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore there were many bandages, then cauterize each one according to what we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them, when you have applied the unguent to them, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the Alcate, it is more final in the healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	The way to cauterize the fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38. The head.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the sick does not submit to the incision and the operation that we have described in his place, and trembles because of it, perhaps he will be healed with a large cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore someone has a fistula, and it is old, pus runs out of it, and corruption.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is fitting that you should investigate by trying the subtle method.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then recognize the depth of the quantity with a test.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then fire the cautery, which is like a ray.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert yourself with the ignited thing into the fistula and the quantity in which it enters with a clamp.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeatedly apply the cautery to her, until all the corrupt bodies are burned up; once, or twice, or three times, according to your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And protect yourself from the heat of the knife, if there is any, or a large iron; or if the fistula issues into the body of the bladder, or into the body of the intestines, then protect yourself from these places altogether.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not perform it unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and consider that it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the place until it is healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place has been sealed, and tissues have been cut off from it, and remains so for a long time: then know that he is now completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if the tissues have not been cut off from it, then know that it is penetrating, or there is a corrupted hole in its depth, or almost like those: whose memory will remain in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	To cauterize veins.
Caput XXXIX.	The head and its members.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain in the kidneys is caused by cold or a gross wind and the patient has been bedridden because of it, then one should cauterize them above the belly button on top of the kidneys, cauterying each kidney with cautery from the claw, whose precedent was a reminder.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we should cauterize him again in the same place with cauterizing.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Why are there three lined areas?
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Thus they will be more effective in the cutting.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	To cauterize the bladder.
Caput XL.	The head.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and moisture until it does not hold urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the urethra next to the bladder where the hairs start with the comb, and cautery from the right side of the urethra, and another from the left: and let the length of the cauterization be in accordance with the width of the thumb: and cauterize it with cautery from the lower back, or two cauters if you can stand it: and let it follow the order that preceded the claw cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	To cauterize the uterus.
Caput XLI.	The head.Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento, sicut de cauterium renum: et sit quae cum caute-
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture occur in the uterus and it is prevented from pregnancy and its menstrual fluids corrupt, and their arousal is delayed, and pain occurs during intercourse, then one should cauterize them with three cauters around the navel as we have said for cauterizing the bladder, and cautery from below the back with a comb, or two cauters: and let it follow the order that preceded the claw cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	To cauterize the anus in a dislocation.
Caput XLII.	The head.Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento, sicut de cauterium renum: et sit quae cum cauterio clauile, et si non potest retineere caute-
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the mucous membrane of the anus flows out to the rectum, and it is caused by its exit from its place: and the sign of it is that the skin extends on one side when it stands up straight: and the location of the dislocation is found in it a hollow place.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	It is therefore necessary that the cautery should be placed on the wound of Acha, with a similar cautery; after you have marked the edge of the wound with wax, as it turns out: and so that it falls itself in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery, whose form has preceded in the cauterization of the stomach,
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	That if this cautery is not present in you, then cauterize yourself with three cauteries, with a large oily cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin of all the body.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care for yourself, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	The way to cauterize in sciatic nerve.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter LIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the wound of Acha, and there is cause for it, cold and moisture: and if the sick person is not relieved with what we have said in distribution, and does not benefit from it, and grows worse: then it is necessary that you should separate the sick from gross humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and like things.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the mode of the cautery in her is according to two ways: either with a cautery with burning medicines, or with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	The cautery with fire is according to many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of them is that you should cauterize on the wound of Acha with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And let them have a good depth or a bad one.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let there be space which is between every cautery according to the thickness of a finger, and let the cautery be with olive oil.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	When, however, the cautery is made in the middle on the top of Acha herself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Why are there four cauteries?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you want to cauterize with a circle, whose form has preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of Acha, one: so that the circle contains all Acha.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn up the thickness of the skin of all the body.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method for treating sciatica when the pain adheres to the nerve itself and does not extend to the thigh or leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends to the thigh or leg, then cauterize the nerve itself with two cautery tools above the hip, above the place where the patient feels pain, and a third cauterizer on the ankle bone at the side opposite the pain: and let the cautery be sharp.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cauterization be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	That if the patient feels that the pain extends almost to the toes, then cauterize it there with a single cautery tool or with several cautery tools if he tolerates it.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he feels pain under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with a sharp cautery tool.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And let your cautery be so that you do not accidentally damage the nerves or large arteries, and so that it does not cause more harm to the patient, or a contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I have already seen one and the other who cauterized above the ankle bone and then ended the cauterization, and the leg swelled up until the foot was completely swollen, and all of it was corroded, and then the solution of the wine came out, and death followed after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	That if the pain is on both sides at the same time, cauterize each one according to this manner.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men have said about the cautery of nerves, whose cauterization is this method.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar cut from iron, whose diameter is half the palm's: and let it be at the opening according to the thickness of the finger nail, or a little more: and inside that one let there be another, with a third one.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let there be space between each finger according to the length of the knuckle nail: and may the openings be on both sides: and may their height be almost like a knot, or two knots: and may they make handles from iron that is unevenly bent in the fingers.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is his form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it is to be heated in fire until it turns red and gives off sparks; then it is to be placed on a plaster of anchuses laid out on the sound side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	So he is to be cauterized with three round wands in one stream of water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let him be left for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Then let him be bandaged with butter: and let the hole be left open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the man with ointment until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Says Albucasis, with this kind of cautery on the son, we are a little afraid, because it is a frightening sight; and also, because we have few who wait for him.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, from good cauterization he who endures this and finds his place with him will benefit.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cauterizer, when you use it with medicine that is being applied, is to be set up so that it can reach the door frame of his chamber, made of iron or steel, its length being double the height of its walls: at the top of which are to be tied two knots, or nearly so.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And there should be a space that is the length of two fingers in between each; and they are to be open at top and bottom: and it is to contain itself opposite to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then let it be placed on a plaster of anchuses laid out on the sound side, as the sick man lies on his sound side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand strongly on the plaster of anchuses.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles of warm water that is slightly heated with fire, and hold it for a certain period of time; and let the sick man endure the stinging, and his burning, because he will feel the sting as fire, until it is at rest.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then wash your hand with oil and rinse it thoroughly with sweet water; then let it be left for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place butter on top of it until the blackness of burning disappears; and let it be left for several days, and let the pus run out from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	It is indeed the last resort in cutting.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that with ointment until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends up to the hip or leg: make him rest in that position so that he can contain water, as you did in the case of the wide one.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of hot water; and I have already written about it in the treatise on the correction of diseases.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and burnt limestone on both sides; shake them together, and put them into a new pitcher whose bottom part is pierced by a small hole, according to the quantity that you add; then put under the bottom of the pitcher another pitcher full of water, which shall be immersed in the alkali and limestone with one finger: then after you have well shaken them, remove the upper pitcher, and pour over the alkali and limestone with water from a pitcher, so that it may flow through the hole at the bottom of the pitcher. Then squeeze the two substances with your hand, and let the water go out:
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then collect all the water, and pour it over another limestone: and set it down, until it is cold.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For that will then be very strong and acute, which is administered in many operations of medicine, and in the cauterization of the remaining members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Since it will effect the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from medicines there are, with which they cauterize the wide one, also like theriac, and honey of acorn, and lime mixed with soap, so that each may be mixed.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen himself related, of a man from ancient times who was cured of pain in the hip and leg (sciatica): he said that it was very effective.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said, He did not like another cure, and that he was cured from one leg only, until he told us, That he perhaps entered a hot bath, and came out already healed.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is, to be received from the ear-ring of a man: and if it is not found in the ear-ring, it shall be taken like this, fresh: and be tied to the hip, where there is pain, or leg, or in the thigh: and be bound, and left for a quantity of three hours, or per quantity that the sick person feels pain from being disturbed.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce him into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	Once therefore the body becomes cold, introduce him into the tub.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain has subsided and he is recovering.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that it is not necessary to apply any ointment to these medicines unless after corporal discharge.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides who said that when the stool of goats is applied as a poultice to an acute sciatica, it does him good: and he makes it a second-class poultice in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Let the wool be soaked in old oil and placed over a deep place, which is between the thumb of the foot and the heel, and is closer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take the goat droppings as it is, and set fire to it in the fire until it becomes a coal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place the coal on the wool, and leave it there until it goes out.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat that.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not therefore cease to do this, until the sense of touch on the part of the mediations has come to the anus, and the pain has rested.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this mode of poultice is called a vaccinal cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	[The cauterization of the pain in the back.]
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 42.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When, therefore, pain occurs in the back from various causes, or from accident, or from blow, or from superfluous discharge, and there are similar cases, from the infusion of cold material, and wet: and cauterization is not done unless in this one kind alone, which is made by the infusion of cold material.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore after discharge of the milk with foul pills, and those similar to them, let three lines be made on the back where the pain is, according to the length of the spine, after having marked with caustics in each line five cauterizations, or more, according to the quantity that comes from the tolerance of the nurse's virtue: and let cauterization be done with a cauteropuncture.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize three or four cauterizations, with a small cauldron in the middle, according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	In order to cauterize in incipient gibbosity.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 50.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	Often this disease occurs in small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its beginning in children is this: for it happens to him in a constriction in hiccupping while lifting up and in movement: and in pain in the last spine of the back and in nodules of its, which has already begun to rise above the other spines.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When you see this then when you want to make it, then cauterize him with a cautery that he is in the form of a circle like this.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And he takes the cautery on all parts of the spine equally: and if you want to cauterize it in the circumference of the spine with a point cautery two lines or three: and let the points be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for the place, until it is healed with him that we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And be careful, do not administer the cautery in gibbosity, which is made in spasm of a nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On how to cauterize in podagra and in pain of joints.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 60.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains of joints are from cold humidities which flow to any member of the body, then when they occur in the feet, it is the custom of doctors to name this podagra properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When however podagra is cured that is caused by cold, with methods of cure, and the pains are not removed, then let the cautery remove them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is, so that it is cauterized him after evacuation in circumference of joint of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be olive oil.
Cuius haec est forma.	Whose this form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you can bear it that points on the face of the foot, then do with a point cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	That if the pains ascend up to the knees or other joints and often this happens: then cauterize him over all the knee with three cauteries, or four from every side, with this same cautery of Cloyius.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	But if you need more of this remedy, then cauterize him then.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, but rather surround it with spice only on the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	But if the pains rise to the knees, and to the back: then administer what we have said in our chapter from the cautery.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	That if the pains are only in the hands, then prick around with fire, as the two lines run out.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	But if any remaining pain remains in the fingers, then prick them, over all the knuckle, and over the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	But if the pains rise after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both sides completely.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not throw away a sick patient from good care, from the reception of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if the regimen is good, and the phlegm is discharged, it will be healed by the aid of God with this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	On the mode of cauterizing in ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Head LXXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine has descended, or it touches the testicle, and that is beginning to be close: then you should order the sick person to cease from eating his own food.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use laxatives, so that the feces descend from his own bowels.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then make him sit between your hands on his back: and order him that he hold his breath, until he goes out, or appears the buttock, or the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce him with your fingers, and mark with the wax under the rupture over the jawbone of the neck, with a mark whose end is similar to half a circle on the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then light the fire of the cautery, which has this form, until it becomes white, and let it drop sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine, or the buttock to its concavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the minister put his hand on the place so that he does not lose the intestine: and you have already opened between the thighs of the nurse, and placed under it a towel, and one serving as another over the thigh, and one holding the hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the caustic on top of the wound, with your hand holding the caustic upright.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it, until you have succeeded in bringing it to the teeth: or else repeat with it a different force, if you have not succeeded in doing so with it in the first instance up to the teeth.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe that no intestinal contents come out during the time of your cauterization, so that you do not burn yourself, and let it pass through in that state to death or great disease.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you have not succeeded with the caustic in bringing it to the teeth, your operation has not been successful.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary that the caustic be subtle for infants, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care with the rest of the ointment, until it has healed over.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the patient lie down on his back for forty days, until the wound is closed up.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you provide him with food according to the length of his cure, which softens his gut: so that he does not pass stool and vomiting.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then give him a loose bandage, and let him remain for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And let him rest from work, and be filled with food and drink, and loud noises.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, so does he heal in an entire way.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will describe the treatment of ruptures with incisions in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When, however, ruptures occur in the remaining gut, and are incipient, and do not add to themselves, then cauterize the rupture of his gut with a round caustic according to its quantity: and let it be as heated from then on like the third one.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then take care for the patient, with what we have said: and do not add anything.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some first say: that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular caustic, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	Afterwards, sign it with the enchain, and place the line which is of the breadth of the back upper rupture, and another line down below it.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And put your hand down in the middle with the clamp closed.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the cautery is easier and better first.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	(On the mode of cauterizing in pain because of accident, or percussion.)
Caput XLVIII.	[Head 58]
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When pain arises in some member through accident or percussion and that pain persists for a long time, and does not respond to medicines: then it is necessary that the cautery be applied with the puncturing cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery be of any size suitable to the member, and its soundness, and its weakness, and its strength, and its twist, and its pain therefrom.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	But if it is healed by the first cautery, it is well.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	But if not: then repeat over the same cautery.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	For the custom of these pains is that they should change from one member to another as it approaches that which concerns it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Why it is necessary that you should remove these with the cautery until the sick member is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	(On the mode of cauterizing in leprosy.)
Caput XLIX.	[Head 59]De Lepra.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	(Of leprosy. But when lepers walk, they should be cauterized by a heavy cautery.)
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the species of leprosy, which is produced through the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: so consider well when you are cauterizing this one.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	But if leprosy is incurable, and you have treated it with the same cautery that we have mentioned in the division, and it has not gone down, nor remained stationary, but there has been corruption all over its complexion: then cauterize it on top of the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the hairline, and a second lower down towards the front at the end of the hair, and two on either side, and one behind the ear at the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And last of all, with a little cautery, put the hand on until it impresses a deep impression into the mouth, and dislocates the membranes from it: so that the expiration of thick vapor may be alleviated from it, and cauterize also with the cautery over the spleen, following the above.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But leper has already spread over the sick person, and it is apparent. Then one should perform the cauterizations with these cauterizations that we have mentioned in the head, and a cauterization on the tip of the nose, and two cauterizations on the two cheeks, and two cauterizations on the two neck vertebrae, and six on the neck back, and one large on the hahosas near the long tail, and one above it, in that same one: and two on the shoulders, namely, on all shoulder one, and two on the knees, and two on the arms, and two on the soft parts of his chest, and cauterize him over all joint, from the joints of his fingers of his hands, and his feet: and cauterize him over all heel of his feet, and the tips of his fingers.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And so that you do not burn them, the nerves that are on the heel of the last foot.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	Then when the cauterization is performed with a cauterizing knife on the bone of the jaw, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the parotid gland.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And you should know that the more you add cauterization, the greater the healing is, and the more it confers.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And you should know that a sick person does not feel pain in the cauterization, unlike a healthy person: indeed, his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauterizations be of appropriate size and shape according to the joints and connections: namely, because they precede in order of tools.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care should be taken with the cauterizations made from a flour of herbs mixed with honey, and with other cures, until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	As for the way to cauterize in stupor:
Caput L.	Head.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When one of the limbs is stupor and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and does not heal, then cauterize the limb that is in stupor with cauterizations, according to whether the size of the limb is increased or decreased.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery remain standing in the thickness of the skin a little.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then put the ointment on the wound, until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes the cautery is stunned, which happens to hand, and foot, in the spine of back near the exit of nerves, which stir that limb: and the stupor passes away.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But he should not press too hard on it, unless he is wise in anatomy of limbs, and the exit of moving nerves of the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	[On the mode of cauterizing after Albucasis.]
Caput LI.	Chapter LII.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albucasis is burned, and there is no medicine applied in it: then cauterize the wound with a deep cautery a little, according to the thickness of the skin, until the flesh turns white, and the color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then cure the wound with herb-flour, and rose-oil, and leaves of arnica, and pigeon's blood, and duck's blood: let each part be a separate piece; all these things are to be mixed together, and laid on a cloth, and adhere to the place, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	[On the mode of cauterizing in cancer.]
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When Cancer is beginning, and the vein must be stopped: then cauterize the vein with a circle of the cautery, as it turns round.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	But the wise have said, that the last cauterization should be made with the cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But I do not see that: for I am afraid that it will burst out: and I have seen it sometimes.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that the cancer should be cauterized round about with a circle as we have said: or else with many cauterizations.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	[On the mode of cauterizing in adhesion.]
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.Et qui ad uicem aut duam, cum unguentium, et lenis saponis et rosae oleae, et salia salis, et collocandi: aut una uiecuntur aut duae: et super illas linimentum lino, et in eum impleatur olei rosa: de quo videmus, ut quod super omnem procerum carnem, cum unguenti-
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When anyone has Adubelasia, and is delayed in its maturation, or because it is causing him to be superfluous, or for the sake of his old age when he is few-blooded, or for time, and the eye rushes to maturity, then cauterize around it with little cauterizations by puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then let go of it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For this will hurry along with its maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you poke a hole in it with cautery, then take this shape of fire cautery.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And lay it down in the middle of Adubelasia until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery follow it, so that the course of the pure may be eased.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then take care of the eye until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	The method of cauterizing in a corrupting disease.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIIII.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	Corrosion is not anything but corruption in a wandering member, and it corrupts itself: as fire devours dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	But if you see corrosion in a place that tolerates cautery with fire, then take many cauteries of fire, small tools and big ones, according to what suits it in the place where the corrosion is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize the eye from every part until you have completely eradicated the corruption, and do not leave any of it inside.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then let go of the eye for three days, and place sulfur triturum with oil on the places that have been cauterized, until all the eschar are eradicated, and all corruption.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then take care of the eye with unguents generating flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	But if you see that after three days meat is born healthy, where there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cauterization on the remaining places of corruption.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And corrosion is sometimes cured with acute medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it rises up in the place of cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	But cauterization with fire is faster in its work: and I have already said about cauterizing it with acute medicine in a division: so you take it there when you can endure it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	To cauterize in claws and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter LVI.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	A frequent malady in the lower parts of the feet is a gross, filthy disease that afflicts the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	There are two ways to cauterize them: with fire and with warm water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for how it is with fire, so that the fire-carving is similar to the feathers of a penknife: which let be made of iron, according to the quantity that it contains of the claw from all parts: and be it not too deep at the edge.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then put the fire-carving itself on the claw.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then turn your hand with the knife around the claw, until the fire-carving has come to the depth of the claw: and leave it for three days, until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then bind the claw with wild silage, crushed with salt: and leave the embalming on the claw in the night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will itself be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with a medicinal ointment of flesh, until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not turned, and frequently happen on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet: then administer to them warm water-carving: and it is, as you take a tube from brass, iron, or a penknife: and put it on the claw, or althelch.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then throw into the tube a little quantity of warm water: hold your hand, and turn it slightly with the pressure of your hand so that the edge of the tube is imprinted in the root of the claw, and let there be warm water available to reach its depth, to the root of the claw: and expect the sick for about one hour on the sensation of the warm water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then leave it, for the claw will be eradicated with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Thus do with one of them, until you are satisfied that they are all healed over all that are in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then the care of them after they are cut off, when it is that they generate flesh out of the ointment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	§ On the way of cauterizing in tremor.
Caput LVI.	Head LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to anyone that there is tremor from cold in a nerve, or from quartan fever, or another kind of fever: then one should make four cauterizations, or five on the spine at the back, and between each spine a cauterization, and in the pit of the stomach a cauterization, and over the stomach a cauterization.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremor ceases with the olive oil cauterization, and health of disease of cold quickens.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	§ On the way of cauterizing by Albather.
Caput LVII.	Head LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When Albather-type foods are expelled from the body, that is, pus which is formed from coarse corrupted materials.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Then one should cauterize first when they appear, over the whole head of the pustules with a fine wooden cautery made from myrrh, whose end is heated with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the long root of aristo-chyme.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lenticular cauterizer.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized with a caustic, at first in accordance with this method: they do not increase; and by interrupting the excess they make, they heal from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, one should make that after evacuation with blood-letting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	§ On the way of cauterizing in a flow of blood from an artery in the arm.
Caput LVIII.	Head LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	This often happens with a flow of blood from an artery that has been cut, which is external, or at the incision of an abscess, or when cauterizing a limb, and such like: and it is difficult to make it stop flowing. Oportet ergo ut facias illud posteuacutem cum phlebotomia, et adhaerendas langes ad rem, quae effert fluxum sanguinis, et adhaereas, et cauteriescas super eum cum cauterio oliuari fortiori, aut sub igni, ut in catula, et cum exiguo caute
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When this therefore happens to anyone, then approach with your hand to the orifice of the artery, and put the tip of your finger on it: and grip it tightly until the blood is stopped under your finger, and does not flow out from under it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put on fire small oliy cauterys, and many in great number: and puff thereupon until they are well burnt up.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take out of them one, or small, or great, according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and lay the cautery upon it, after which you will move your finger quickly: and hold the cautery, until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	That if you drive away with your finger from the opening of the artery, and put out the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from those which are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	So therefore do not cease to do that with one after another, until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And be careful, so as not to burn up the nervy tissue which is there, and let some other evil come upon the sick person.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And you shall know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut off [the tissue]: especially if the artery is large, unless with four fingers.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with the cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, it shrinks, and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is tied with a strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or they are placed upon the tissue by virtue of their property, from which the blood is cut off, and tied with a pulse-tight bandage.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	But he who administers the cutting off of it with a ligature, and tightening with a bandage, or placing burning things and like things upon it, does not give him a deep wound, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	But if this should happen to anyone, and there is no present physician or medicine: then let the finger of the left hand begin to lie upon the opening of the wound, as we have related, and its constriction well, until the blood which comes from the upper part of the wound is stopped by pressing on it, and lying upon the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And let the finger not move away from it, with cool water constantly flowing over it, until the blood has congealed, and thickened, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meantime he is to consider whether he needs a caustic or medicine.
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	1st Part First End
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	The Book of Surgery by Albucasis Part II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On incision, perforation, and bloodletting on wounds and similar matters.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already spoken in the first chapter of all sicknesses that are treated with a burning caustic and medicine combined, their occasions, causes, instruments, and forms of caustics.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I placed those chapters from the beginning to the end.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: that is, in order to answer the question of the inquiring person.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary for you to learn, O son, that the fear expressed in the first chapter on cauterization applies here.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And for that, it is necessary to be more cautious, since a great deal of blood flows in the operation described in this chapter, which can cause fainting when opening the veins, or incisions on a bruise, or opening an exit from the body, or curing wounds, or extracting an arrow, or incising on a stone, and similar ones: from all of which trembling and fear arise, and death falls from many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, so that it does not fall on you, for when people of this art fall into such a state, they often fall from their health with sicknesses of the body.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For among them is one who becomes angry with his illness and becomes weak in his disease: because of the severity that he finds in his sickness and the length of his evil.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when the illness is from fear, which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And among them is one who gives you a drink, and promises you health, but his illness is destructive.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore it is not right for you to consent to him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let caution be our greater guide than our greed and avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presumptiously assert anything from it without certain knowledge, which verifies with you what comes to successful succession worthy of praise.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And so that you may cure all your patients' illnesses, diagnose and indicate what is most suitable for their health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in it is your aid in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O sons, with His understanding, and may He not take away your guidance and inspiration: for it is in His hands.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have arranged this Chapter by dividing it into Chapters, following the order of Caution, from the crown to the toes: that you may find what you desire from it, and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	On the Cure of Water which is added to the heads of boys.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You should know that this illness often occurs in boys at birth: or when the midwife presses the boy's head without lightness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it also happens for an unknown secret cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I did not see this illness in anyone else but in boys, and I wished to see all of them die: therefore for that reason I have abstained from operating on them.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I saw a boy among them whose head was swelled with water, and his head increased in size every day, until he could not sit on himself, due to the size of his head: and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture, or it aggregates between the skin and the jaw: or it aggregates under the bone above the jaw.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation on him, if it is moisture between the skin and the jaw, and there is a small pimple, then you should find a single notch in the middle of the head in width: and the length of the notch should be almost two knots, until the moisture runs.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of the scalpel.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If then there is more moisture and the hematoma is larger, then place them two splits, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone and you see the sign of it, that you see the commissures of the head open from all parts: and when you squeeze it with your hand towards the inside, and this is not hidden from you: then you should find in the middle of the head three splits, according to this way.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after cutting remove all moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then tighten the splits with rags and powder.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then dip it in wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the ligaments, and care for the tendon with linen cloth, and anoints.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not stop tightening the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick with dry food and little moisture until their member is comforted and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another way of cutting is so that you consider where the hematoma appears large and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Since when there is more in the back or at the top or on the right or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	So ascend with the cutting where it appears to you that the hematoma and the filling of water: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe so that you do not hit the artery, and it happens to be a flow of blood, and the sick dies from that flow with an evaporation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Of the incisions of arteries that are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Head 2.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When it happens to anyone that there is a discharge to the eyes or to the chest and this does not bring about a cure with medicines: then more effective treatment is on him, cutting of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	So you should when you want to cut them, that the sick person shakes his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then fear the place with rough cloth so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the patient tied his own shirt around his neck with a knot.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the pulse is beating.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places are the same as those that are behind the ears depressed: and rarely is hidden, unless in some people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then signs with caustic on both: and cut each one with a hammer sharp on both sides the incision approaching to the mouth: and let it be done in the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, introduce the chisel under the artery, and cut it towards the top with an incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be almost two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the pulse is incised, blood flows out with the pulse, which rises to the inside at a frequent jump.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	But if the artery does not appear to the sense, then it is necessary that measurements are taken from the hair quantity of three fingers space.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then signs with caustic, and find all the way up to the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what is necessary to be emitted from blood, is six minutes, and perhaps you emit from it more or less.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All this is according to the quantity that appears to you from the vein and filling of the artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider towards the neck.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if there is anything left out of the mouth of a spoon, then cut it so that it does not happen an abscess hot: and then tighten the neck with a knot of linen cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for himself with ointment, until he is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Regarding the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Head
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a man of old headache, or of acute catarrh by reason of the moisture acrid and heat in the lacertis of the temples, or of old soda, vehemens, and similar to them: then we treat with methods of medical treatment, and do not give it: then we are expert in these ailments the extraction of arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have told.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the mode of operation in extracting them, is, as the sickly hair that is in the temples, is shaved off, and is extended to the apparent artery in the time.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	And it itself is shown you from its pulse, and rarely hidden except in a few men, or by a great shivering of cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	That if it is hidden from you, then the sick person should tie his head with any cloth: and then the place of shivering with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or heat the place with warm water until it appears to you in a manifest appearance.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take a stick that is slightly bent.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then skin the flesh with it easily until you reach an artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw in it a hook, and extract it upwards, until you extract it out of the skin, and make it ooze with tunics that are under it from all parts.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	But if the artery is thin: then wrap it up with the hook's end.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut off from it a part according to how long its ends are stretched and stretched, and not causing a flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut off, and if it is not extracted, the blood does not rise deeply.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then make the blood flow out with six ounces of water up to III.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	For if the artery is large: then it should be tied up at two places with a double thread, strong, from silk: or with a hame of horsehair, so that it does not happen to putrefaction before consolidation of the wound, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut off the superfluity, which is between the two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Make it in that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if there is a wound, cauterize it with the cautery up to the nose, with the metal cautery: until its ends are cut off, and it stands in place of that work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is a better work, unless the sick person has a fever, or is a person with a cald face.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For the cautery is of those which remain to finish the moistures.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better to bind up.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the extraction of the arteries, that it may be filled with the old cooked one: and let they be placed upon the wound from without made.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the solution of the poultice with dry medicines, which make the flesh to grow, and with liniments, until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	That if, while you are operating, a flow of blood comes from the artery, then proceed to cut it off with the cautery, or fill the place with pitch: and press your hand, until the blood is cut off.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	That if you have nothing present to do so, then put your finger upon the place, until the blood is frozen.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And moisten the place with water of coldness, until the smarting ceases, and press according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And from that which is softer and easier to extract the artery, it is, as if the sharp edge of a knife with this cautery having two blades: and the sharpness of the two blades is like an almond.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are much less sharp in sharpness than the two blades.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Since if they are acute, as the two blades, it is fitting that both have coldness: and do not strike the flesh with velocity.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	But when there is a little roughness in them, it is held in them the heat of fire, and the flesh is cut off quickly: so that with this work it is better, lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And be a space which is the quantity of the roughness of the finger between the two blades after you have marked the two places with fire: and place the two bright ones, until they come to the tip, and strike only at the two places: so that it may grow longer what is between the extremities of it.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	Since they do not consolidate with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the treatment of acute and chronic eye diseases.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV. On the treatment of acute and chronic eye diseases.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	If the tears are persistent and the eyes are sore, and the hair on the outer part of the head is breaking off, and there is no benefit from medical treatment; and his eyes become red, and his forehead feels like it is walking like ants, and his eyelids are swollen with tears: then the ancient people used to treat them with this operation, and called it Ense.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is as you command to shave off the hair on the forehead of the sick person.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three cuts in the forehead at equal distances along its length; and let the length of each cut be almost like two fingers, and one cut be at an equal distance from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second be according to the length of the jaw, and the third be from the edge of the other: and take care not to cut the arteries that are on both sides: and extend your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space between each cut be the length of three joined fingers: and take a sponge fragment prepared, or many dried sheets, with which to dry up the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert a sharp tool made of two acute points, whose shape is as follows: and immediately after it is:
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision that is from the temporal side, up to the second incision: and scrape with it all the skin that is between the two cuts, with soap, which is on top of the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then also make this from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then remove this knife and insert into the first incision another tool, which is called an acute chisel, made of soft wood on one side, not acute on the other:
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape:
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its acute side towards the flesh attached with skin, and its soft side towards the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle cut: and sever with it all the tools that descend from the head to the eyes: except that it continues the incision up to the point where the skin appears.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then make that incision from the middle notch all the way to another notch.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after a quantity of blood has drained that is equal to the amount of blood that has accumulated, squeeze out the place from which the clot of blood has come.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then put a strip of lint over the whole wound, and place on top of them cotton balls soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And bind so that there is no heat scab.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day dissolve the strips, and administer a strong infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for that with basilicum ointment, and with the others which are used to cure wounds: until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	[On the treatment of acute tears and cataracts in the eyes from within the head.]
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When acute, bitter, and persistent cataracts occur in someone's eyes, and their eyes seem weakened, with inflamed eyelids and hair falling out from them, and there is a sharp pain at the base of the skull, followed by subsequent sneezing: then remove these accidents, as those materials do not come unless they are removed with many medicines.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the best treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is as you command to remove the sick person's forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make an incision in that one notch in the middle of the forehead, or a little bit more than halfway across from one side to the other: and begin the cut from the left side of the nose to the right side: and extend the cut all the way down to the mouth: and lengthen your hand away from the jawbones, which move during mastication: until it is stopped by the mouth: and you will dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with dried lint or strips of linen.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then tie it tightly from above with cotton balls: and soak the cotton balls in wine and oil so that there is no heat scab.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you dissolve that, and you will see that the heat scab is about to form: then it is necessary that you stop up the nose, until it begins to form a baby nose.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then take care of himself with the dry regime which makes him give birth to flesh: as if you took two parts from wheat flour and four parts from colophony, and prepared from them an ointment, and administered it for the birth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	The cure for him who falls into gold:
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	All that falls into gold is of four kinds: or a mineral rock, or something similar to it, such as iron, and an effleurage; or it is from a plant, such as beans, and peas; or it is a fluid thing, such as water, and vinegar, and things like them; or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	And when a rock falls into gold, or a kind of rock that does not add to it, or does not grow in gold, expose the gold to the sun: but if you see a rock, then distill in gold some of the oil of sesame, or of mustard seed.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction, and make it snuff up with condiments, and paint the nostrils at the approach of sniffing, after you have placed in the vicinity of gold swaths made of cloth, or wool, and spread the gold towards the top.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For this cure is to be repeated many times.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not leave [the gold], then administer the extraction with gentle gestures, that is, with subtle pizgaroli: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	But if it leaves [the gold] with gentle gestures, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction with a subtle blind hook, made of few doublings.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	But if it does not leave  [the gold] with this, then make a tube of brass, and insert the end of the tube in the hole of the ear much, and paint that which is around the tube with soft brass with oil, so that there be no passage for wind except through the tube: and then extract with your strong attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For this cure is to be repeated many times.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if it does not leave  [the gold] in this way: then take from the hen-egg or from the water, that is, prepared gluten, with which the birds are caught; and place it at the tip of the ear after you have dried it slightly with a cotton ball: and then insert it into the hole of the ear easily, after you have taken off the gold from the ear by drying it.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If therefore he does not go out with all that we have related, then proceed to split it open, before the hot abcess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the mode of the incision is such, that the phlebotomist takes it from the back of the head first: and he draws out the blood therefrom according to the measure of his usefulness.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear towards the top, and find the hole at the base of his ear next to his fat in a depressed place: and let the hole be round in shape, until you reach the stone; then take it out with it, which is possible for you with your instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then sue the incision from now on with speed, and attend to it, until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	That if what falls into the ear is from one grain, which grows and swells: then administer extraction of it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it does not submit to you for exit, then take a thin, delicate speculum according to this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the incision of its speculum from one grain that falls into the ear, and do not consider when you think that this grain has already become moist because of the vapor of the ear, until you put it on many whips: then remove it with a hook, or with a subtle gesture, or with suction, as we have said, for the extraction of it is soothing.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In water, however, which is put into the ear, let it be used by the sick with sneezing when he is first dressed: and already it fills his ear with some cooked old stuff: and he lies on that ear where there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If then he goes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many small stones according to the length of a finger, soft, dull, and warm them with fire for a little while, and let the sick person put one of them into his ear: and let it come out at the bottom part from his foot, and hit against another stone on the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore cease not doing that with stones and stone-cutting, until he goeth out all entirely in water.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And also goeth out the water so, that thou mayest take from the wood, or from the vine, and putteth the extremitas one of it in the aurum: and lightest the extremitas other with fire, until it is very much burnt.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat the jingling another time, and do so many times as is said above in the stone: and draw it out with a tube according as was said above in the wood.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In extraction also of animals in it, if it is a small body as a mouse, and such like, take care of it as I said in division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a body of great size, which appears to the sense: then administer the extraction of it with gestures and hooks: and the thing is easier for all those that hold on to the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In extraction also of a child in the ear, when you take care of it with that which we have said in division, and in the treatise on distillation, and your cure does not avail: then thou mustest look in the ear towards the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	But if it seems there anything of the vermes, then draw it out with a gesture, or with a subtle hook.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	But if nothing seems there: then take a tube, which has this form, narrow below, wide above: and put the end of it into the ear according to that quantity which the weak can bear: and then suck with it a strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do so many times as is said above, until all the vermes go out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	But if they do not obey thee to the exit: then load around the tube with ceruse, as I said above in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	That if they do not go out with that which we have said: then administer the distillations which the ancient ones did know in the infection of the vermes: and thou shalt find it in the treatise on distillation.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your oil and medicines flow out with this instrument when you hold it thus, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see the face made of silver or bronze, lower part stricted, in which sit small hole, wide upper.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	So sit as if you push what is in the concavity of the tube, sit from bronze made askew.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take the ray, and spin it in the end of it by gentle spinning: then pour oil, or juice, or what you wish from these medicines into the tube: and let it sit in the ear: then introduce the ray with the cotton wet, and squeeze it with your hand gently, until it shoots out the oil in the cavity, and feels warm inside: and let not be that which is distilled into it cold too much: for these medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the treatment of an ear infection with silver.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	When some children come out from their mothers' wombs not pierced.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it has also happened and to some men an ear infection with silver, or flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this infection when it forms in the deep cavity of the ear, which does not follow washing: and when it happens to the external cavity a little, and follows washing.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	That therefore which happens in the deep ear, and which does not understand aspect, is in many dispositions difficult to cure.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which follows washing, it is necessary that you put silver Nurse on the sun, and watch in it: then if you see an infection appearing, open it with a sharp spatula, of which form is this one following, sit the end where sits some little width, whose some part sits acute: and the other spatumile sit of two sides soft: so that does not hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If then an infection is from flesh born in the ear: then hold it with a small hook, and cut it with ease gentle, until all flesh is taken away.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If there is a swelling in the deep part of the ear: then take a thin ray, wood, and heat it slightly with fire: then send it into the meatus of the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If you feel a swelling with it, that which is associated with a loss of hearing with weight: try to ease it with ease: and beware, do not injure the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put a drop of liquid into the ear according to the amount of the width of the foramen, which you have introduced with Egyptian ointment: leave it for a few days, until you are sure of the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take a drop and put it into water that has been rose-colored, and dust it over the ear with finely ground powder, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see the ear already opening: then it is necessary that you should take a drop of liquid and send it out with another drop, which you have introduced into a green thing that is made with rose-colored oil, until it stops being hot: then take care of the ear until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If, however, there is a flow of blood: then dip a sponge or cloth into cold water and put it on the ear: and use the remaining cure, which stops the predicted flow of blood in the treatment of distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	The cure of Azelai of the eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	This is Althelai's treatment for eyelids that are either moist or dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	It is necessary that you should hold them with nails: or with a pin, and pound them with the roots of herbs.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then put finely ground powder on the places.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If, however, blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a thin lens cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And cauterize them, it is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For many times they return when they remain with some of their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	Regarding the treatment of eyelids of the eyes.
Caput IX.	Chapters on the diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases and injuries.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	There are times when a substance accumulates in the eyelids, which is firm and resilient, and for this reason it is called Grandini, and it is an aggregation of thick moisture in the upper lid, and in the lower lid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Therefore, when it comes to these eyelids, you should know that if the Grandini is coming from the eyelid, which appears on the eye, and moves to all parts, and the thing is easy to do.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	So then find over it a slit in width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it off from all parts with ease until it is clean.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if you are not prepared to cut it off, unless you penetrate the eyelid with a slight incision, then it will hurt the eye in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the slit is large: then aggregate it with a stitch: and take care of it, until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, do not cause harm from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	Because the ointment restores it and makes it infected.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the Grandini falls inside the ear toward the inner surface, then invert the eyelid and hang the Grandini with a hook: apart from that, you will cut it off, and press it on all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is stretched by the incision, then it does not hurt in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then cleanse the eye after the incision of Grandini with salty water: and take care of the place with it that is infected, until it heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	Chapter on the treatment of eyelids.
Caput X.	Head 10.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a substance that grows on the eyelids: and it often happens to boys; and it causes their eyes to water, and they cannot see the sunlight, because tears flow toward them, and therefore they lie on their faces all the time, and they sleep on their faces, and their eyelids are always moist with inflammation, which has now been caused by an inflation: and the prominence of Axirnath is apparent to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the mode of his operation is that he should put the sick person's head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a sheet of linen and prepare it with strings, and make a loop from it according to the quantity that contains the axernath from all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place him on it and press with your fingers from all sides so that the axernath is gathered together in the middle of the loop.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of his head with a wet finger incident to the crack from side to side, and there is not a larger crack that is made in phlebotomy in the depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it should be that you find all the skin, until you reach the axernath, for in many positions the axernath proceeds from the crack according to the form of the white layer being frustrated.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore take it out with the cloth that you have soaked between your fingers on the outside: and you will turn your hand to the right and to the left until it is scattered: and carefully, so as not to add to the crack, so that you do not come with a finger to the eye, and let it go.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If, however, the axernath does not appear to you at first in the crack, you should add to the crack a little with ease, until the axernath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then take it out, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then dip the cloth in vinegar and water, and place them on the spot, and squeeze him with dust.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are people who sprinkle salt, and put it in the crack, that the remaining moisture from it may become liquid.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If, however, there happens to be a hot swollen place, then take care of it with poultices of cold, until it is healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	As for the modes of operation of the eye, that is, when the eyelids are soft to the eye, since it causes them to twitch as if they were not soft.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs grow out in the eyelids beyond their natural course, and grow backward: then they hurt the eye, and cause various diseases, such as constant tears, moisture of the eyelids, and white spots, until this causes destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And Ataxmir also cures the eye according to four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or with a cauldron and fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp medicine, according to what is premised in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir cures by incising and suturing.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with tubes, as I call it.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you place the patient's head in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the patient's eyelid with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is turned, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: enter it with a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and cause it to penetrate with a thread upward, and let it be near the hair itself, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow: and pull the thread upward with the lid, and turn it outward with the point.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find on the inner side of the eyelid beneath the hairs added with a knife coming from the greater tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then pull out the thread, and place under the eyelid a small piece of wool from wool, or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with caustics, which are like a fig leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that the figure be varied in quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for this varies among men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	From them one is who does not wish to be turned from the eyelid a great deal, according to the quantity which softens from the lid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then find with the knife on the two lines that you marked, and begin from the greater tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let there be one slit near the natural hairs, as is the girth of a radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then introduce an awl in two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape all of it.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then gather together with sutures two lips, with an awl and a thin thread: and wipe away the blood, and let that which is surplus from the hairs adhere to the two eyelids, with certain things that are invisible, if you wish to do this: and if not, I do not cure.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the stitch and thread for three days, or four: thereafter care for it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if there is a wound, leave the raw flesh without stitching, and care for it with that, which dries up and tightens.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid should be removed from the seal of the wound and its aggregation: but a better one will come in time.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	In this way, Ataxmir taught the ancient method of caring for it.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, in that is a trouble about the sick one, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in that.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another mode is also with Ataxmir: and it is, as signs on the eyelid, a figure which is like a fig-leaf, as we have told.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then wash the eyelid with three separate or gathered hooks, according to this form which follows, then cut off what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with an equality of the incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if you are not able to hold the hook, and it does not fit that way: then take a thread in which is a knot, and put it in the middle of the figure: and put another thread near the tear of the eye, and a third thread near the tear of the eye less: and gather the threads between your fingers with an equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then wash your hand with an equal washing: and wash the skin over which is marked the fold, as we have told.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound with a stitch: and care for it, until it is healed.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	But if there happens to be a blister on your incision, or a crack: but that blister with olive oil, and these like things, from sitting in the sun.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when ever the eyelids turn round, as they do so by their own hair.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore you should use what we have said to the incision: but the stitch is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	The care of Ataxmir with the hooks.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	AND is, as you turn round the eyelid, and cut the crack which is within, according to this which we have told.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two sticks or two thin pieces of wood; their length should be according to the length of the eyelid and their width according to the lesser width of a spoon; and you have already marked out on both ends where the threads run from one side to the other.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then collect with care on top of what hangs over the eyelid, and tightly tie together the two sticks from both sides with a strong knot, and leave it for a few days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin is tight and will die and be damaged, and rot until it falls away on its own.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If then it is delayed, then cut it with a knife.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When then is consolidated, the eyelid is lifted up: and the hairs are not prickly.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of the two sticks, which you should make according to this figure, and the quantity in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	De the elevation of the prickly hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation on it is as follows: you take a fine needle, and stick it into the eye through a fine thread.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then collect the ends of it, and tie each end with a fine knot; and make the length of the threads be a palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then put another fine thread under it in an अलिंξωτάκι, and tie the ends of it with a knot if you want.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then place the sick head in your lap, and hold it near the light so that the operation may be seen: for the operation is subtle or minute.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then stick the needle with the Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and push it quickly into the eyelid until it comes out at the edge of a natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw the hair up above the Alinxotati: and stick it into the Alinxotati; if one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand away from it, until the hair comes out with the Alinxotati onto the eyelid with a natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If, however, the hair has been torn out and does not grow back: pull out the hair from below with a thread that you have put into it until it comes out through the upper opening, and pierce it with your finger: then pull out the hair and thread, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair grows back in its place, and a scar forms over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	That if the hair is short, then either attach to it a long hair from the natural hairs, and pull it out with it; or leave it alone until it grows longer after a space, and then pull it out.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	On the treatment of the alxatratus which happens in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII: Head.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When these happen to the eye, they are called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And these alxatratus are either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	So the accidental alxatratus is caused by the congestion of a wound, or a section, or a cauterization, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the mode of operation in it is, that you find her congestion, and that you separate its lips, and put into it what is between them, a piece of linen, and bind it, until it is healed.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary, that you should use in its treatment those things which dry and constrict; for if you do so, it will return worse than it was: but use in it those things which soften, such as foenugraeum; and bathe it with water, in which has been boiled althea, semen lini; and apply with it an ointment that is liquified with some of the oils; and wipe it with linen, and treat it with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And your treasure of healing is, that you should seek with all your ability to prevent its consolidation, according to the form which it had in the beginning.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have described, is no other than a certain correction of the alxatratus, so that it does not return to the form of the place entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	On the treatment of the upper eyelid, which is a twitching or contraction upward to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Head XXVIII.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This of Al-Khattabi which is done below, is that which is truly called Al-Khattabi.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one is made by an arrow, or a scar, or a wound, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the way of operation in it is, that you take an arrow, in which there is a double filament, and touch it to the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the filament reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upward with an awl, and strike it with a chisel from the side.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If then the form of the eyelid returns according to what is necessary, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a radium, and put it in the groove, and turn it with it the eyelid: and find two grooves on the inner side of the eyelid, and their ends are from two angles of incision, until they meet and make the angle: until when they come together, make this figure, and it is a Greek letter.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh in quantity, which is the acute lower side of it, from there where it follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather together the separated parts: join them with sheep's wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with that which we have said, of soothing medicines, and liniments, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if the Al-Khattabi comes about from a groove, or縫合, or an arrow: then you must find a flat groove under the eyebrows, also according to what came before.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate the two lips with a liniment, according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of the speech on the treatment of the Al-Khattabi when it is above or below, is that it pursues a certain operation, according to which it is prepared from the form of the Al-Khattabi.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For this reason, the shape itself is very diverse and the skillful artisan prepares his mind with any possible means until he restores the figure to a natural form or near it, and also becomes ill according to what is appropriate to him from operation and instruments in various positions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	The adhesive force of the eyelid with the conjunctiva or the cornea:
Caput XV.	De exsecatione laceratione & ligature illaquatione.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	When this consolidation happens to many people so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye and prevents itself from its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, you should insert the tip of a ruler under the eyelid and raise it up: or extend it with a needle: then cut the adhesion with a very fine awl that does not have the sharpness of incision with needles, but rather is somewhat blunt: so that the sick person does not become disturbed at the operation, and removes the needle, and hurts his eye with its sharpness: and your incision is as if you were taking away its adhesion with ease, until he returns the eyelid to its natural form, and heals the entire adhesion.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour into the eye salty water, with which to wash it: or distill in it from a wine-skin dissolved in water: or from zinc dissolved in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a thread: and place on the eye wool infused with wax: and after three days use oil, and with consolidations, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	The Incision of the nail and the eminence of the flesh of tears:
Caput XVI.	De exsecatione laceratione & ligature illaquatione.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You know that the nail is second in two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	It is a nerve, and it is like a hard bone, thin.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	It is not a nerve, and it is like frozen moisture of white, which, when it touches metal, or iron to take hold of with a needle, is torn off, and does not form an uncinous shape.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both kinds of wounds do not begin until the larger tear has occurred, until they are slowly discovered, until the fluid is gathered, and the light and movement of the eye are blocked.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And his method of operation in this incision is: that he may lay his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes and wipe his eyelids with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then take a fingernail with a little tweezers and extend it towards the top.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a pin from the horse's hair, or a hook, or a needle: and make the thread strong, and double its end a little, and fix it in the center of the nail: and pierce it with the pin, and tie it with a nail-thread, and extend it towards the top: and scrape it with the hair on the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were holding it with the hair until the end of the nail.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut off the residue at the base of the eyelid with a sharp scalpel, or a pair of tiny scissors: and let go of the natural lid tissue so that the course of tears does not continue to flow.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when the nail is extended with just a fingernail: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrape it with a soft scalpel, whose shape is this.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And be careful so that the scalpel does not scratch the horny tunic, and do not cause a tear in it, and do not pierce the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, pour a little crushed salt into the eye, or make a paste from zinc, and let it rest until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the eye with whatever is necessary, until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not sensate, and you cannot insert an acorn into it, and there is no hold for a hook: then very often care this kind of nail with medicines, and it heals as well as tells in division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you are to incision the vein, then open the eye with care, and take a very sharp scalpel, gentle in sharpness, such as this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And trim the nail from above with precision.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	That if you see that it itself is thinned and dried up, and impressed with the cut, then distil from your hour in the eye made from sieves made of linen, or from red sieves, or from ground salt: and polish the eyes until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation on it again until all of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless you find that a hot pussylike eye is against you: for then let go of it, and take care of the pussy until it is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on the same thing with precision until it is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	Except that the flesh of the eyelids, if it hurts in the eye with great pain, is suspended with a hook, and is cut from that part of it: and do not make the last cut, lest the course of the tears run away.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then distil in the eyelids a sieves made of red, or made of linen, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Regarding the incisions of Al-Wa-Ward and the flesh that has grown in the eye:
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	It grows when it is composed of red flesh in the eyes of some people, or placed on top of it, until it covers the pupil, or comes closer, or presses onto the eyelids, and possibly turns the eyelids outward: and it disappears from under the eyebrows.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation on it is also that he who has a sick head puts it in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and pick up all the flesh with a suitable hook: and hold it with one forceps, or grasp it.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut into the flesh first, until all of it is finished with the incision tool.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And keep the eye away from you during the operation: and let your incision be such that it does not touch the eye, or with a small chisel, which we have mentioned in the cutting of the nail: or with small forceps, according to which the shape of the flesh will come out after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your incision is thus completed, and the whole algardenici has been moved away, then fill the eye with salt crushed: or distill into it red powder, and similar things from the corrupted medicines: and place over the eye a cottum with albugine: so that it is secured from heat of apostasis.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	That if anything remains of the algardenici, and a warm blood dominates you, and you time for the heat to subside: then discharge the eye, and take care for it with what soothes while the heat subsides.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over the site with the operation, until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And likewise do likewise with the flesh added which happens to the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that the healing of any weak eye from its natural way or from an accident be carried out with iron: and do not put your hand into any of these operations until you have fallen asleep, for that member is tolerant of that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Regarding the removal of sebaceous matter from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18: The head.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	There are red sebaceous matter which cover the eye, and prevent its operation: and they weaken the eye with the passage of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore it is necessary that you first, if the eye in which is Sebel is strong, and there is no other illness in it but Sebel: then collect Sebel from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is, as you order the sick person to put his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then hang those red sebaceous matter with a hook one, or two, according to your caution: and may the hook be thin, according to this form, or may there be two hooks separated in the body one, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then take with subtle hooks those red sebaceous matter with subtlety, and wipe the blood hour after hour, until they have fallen out of the eye, and are resolved: and do not leave the eye with the edges of a spatula.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the south [direction] before the sun, and be firm in your operation, sharp [in your effort]. So that you do not fall except those [fingers] nails.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished [the operation], then sprinkle on the wound with white of egg, or red wine: so that its sharpness may corrode what remains of the scar.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	But if you are not able to gather all of it in that hour, then bandage the eye with that, which soothes the pain of the eye: and leave it for a few days, until the pain subsides: and protect it from the hot breeze: and then repeat over it the same way again, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the scalpel.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	(De) Reduction (of) Arsy (to the nose).
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Nam videres, ut superius nasum adspicere possint, et illi qui extenui illaque faciunt, ut sint in operando, cum illis cuiusaus et pilis et iustis. Et si illius est suppletio, nonne et hae sunt?
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it is not healed then there is no skill in it: unless you discover the skin-depth at its birth, and scrape out all the moisture that is in it and pus, until the bone is detected.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	So when the bone is detected, and you see corruption or blackening in it, then shave it with an instrument, the form of which is as follows.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the Aspery scalpels.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of iron, and let its head be round like an azir, that it may be dotted with the edge of a file, or with the dotting of a small awl: and place it on the site of the corruption of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then move it between your fingers, and press your hand gently, until you know that that corruption is now shaved: and do it a few times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with dried-out stimulants of strychnine.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	But if the place is consolidated, and bone is born in it, and the course of blood is cut off: and remains for forty days, and does not renew itself, and does not ooze, and does not happen to it any accident: then you shall know that it has been healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no skill in it, unless he reduces the tube to the nostril, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And is, that you discover the second bone with iron, or with acute medicine: and when it has been discovered, then seize the second terbum, according to this form, its end being iron, triangular; and its wood being a pyramid extended up to the extreme end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then put that on top of the bone itself: and let it be near the lacrimal: and extend your hand from the eye a little.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then rotate your hand with the terubrum, until it penetrates the bone and feels weak: by this you will see that a sensitiveness is leaving it as it holds its hand over its nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore at that time restore the place with stinging medicines, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When the flesh has then grown up, and the place has hardened: at that time the substance which flowed to the outside returns to the nose: therefore it is lighter on the weak.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	De reductione eminentiae oculi.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX - On the reduction of a prominent eye.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes with its entirety, and does not happen to damage the vision or decrease it: then you should open the eyelid: then you should bleed it: then you should put ventosas on the skin without scarring, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then put over the eye a lotion that is made of acacia, and aloe, and olive oil, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then tighten the eye from above over the plaster with various powders.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the mode of the powders is: that you take soft cloths, many, and double all the cloths out of them four: make from them many: then put them one on top of the other, according to the quantity which the eye needs: then tighten them over each other with a hard cloth, stricture strong.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And again put ventosas on without scarring.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the ventosas, and let go of the tightened eye day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If however the ligament is again softened, then it should be tightly bound: afterwards remove the ligament after a day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If however you see that the eye has healed and the wound of the cornea is good, this is good: and if not, then put on again ointment and dust and bind it tightly, and moisten it with a moistening, until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	§ On the Incision of the Tunica.
Caput XXI.	CHAPTER XXII.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture occurs in the tunic of the eye, then it should be cut and removed from outside the eyelids as far as a grain of wheat, and fed with a tool in order that it may be incised: then the operation in it is according to what you can put into the root of the eye from below to above.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another acumen, which is a double thread from the lacrimal side, and cause it to penetrate: and then let go of the first one according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then incise the place where the double thread is, and tie that end of the eye with a thread around it: and tighten it well.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then extract it again, and place on the eye wool infused with albumen of the eye: and then let go of it until the thread falls with the eye.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of the eye with that, which comforts it, until the scar heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the eye is tied up on all sides with a circle of cloth, until it adds a great prominence to the eye.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is to be pierced with a fine awl, which reaches to the depth of the eye, and moistened with albumen, and the eye drops and enters immediately: then tie it up, until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	§ On the Treatment of Alcmaeon.
Caput XXII.	CHAPTER XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This illness called Alcmaeon's, is not anything but a kind of moisture that is gathered in the eye, similar to water dropping down, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the mode of operation in it is, that you should make the sick sit on a prepared chair, or straight.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head in your hands from both sides, and move it until you can see his eyes below.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then fix him, and let it not fall, and let the light be complete: and let the sick person see as he saw: and if it does not go down below, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If, however, the descent is not prepared with him as we said, then make the sick person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a thin spatula, and find with it above the cornified tissue somewhat at the intersection with the corneal layer on the crown, until the substance comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it has come out, then distil into the eye hot water in which you mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled foenugreek and honey: then let it be cared for with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	As for the care of the water that entered the eye, or a cascade.
Caput XXIII.	Head 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already spoken about the kind of water, explaining and showing what it is suited for, then take that same one according to the health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands square-wise, opposite to the light, near the sun: and tie his healthy eye, and tighten it tightly: then, with your right hand, paw the eyelid of his eye from which the water comes out, if the eye is on the left: or with your left hand, if the eye is on the right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right-hand almond, if the eye is on the left: or with your left hand, if the eye is on the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then put the end of the almond close to the crown by the thickness of the radius in the white of the eye apparent tear: then push the almond with force: and you rub it with your hand, until it enters into the eyelid: and you will feel that the almond has already come to the moist part.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is fitting that there be a measurement of the road from the edge of the pupil to the end of the ring of blackness: and this is the cornea of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see it in itself in the pupil of the eye with its clarity of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then put the magnet until the place where is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it itself downward with one stroke after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	But if the water has descended at once, then immediately it sees that thing which opens its sight at once, and the magnet in its eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then you rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	But if the water has descended, then put it down again, except that it should go out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When it is set, and does not rise up: then pull out the magnet with ease: and you raise your hand little by little.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve in water some of the clear salt of the jewel: and wash with it the inner part of the eye.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put outside all the eye a paste, or wool infused with oil and waxed, and ties it up with it a healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we, and those who are our time, put on it minced thyme with milk-wax.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	That if the magnet does not obey you at the entrance to the eye because of its hardness, since it is from men, whose eye is very hard: then you should take a blade, which is called Alberid, whose form is as follows.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Then open it with him only at the joint, and not at the end of your hand: and is there not except that you should make a hole for the magnet to the soft place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then put in the magnet, according to what we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And near the completion of your work, prepare for the infirm man a dark bedroom in which he should sleep on his back in a dark house: and prohibit him from all movements, and from coughing: and put before him food which suits his nature: and let him not move his head to the right or to the left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the second ligament be placed according to its position until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then dissolve that in that dark house, and test its effect; and make it look at things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligament until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary for him to make that during the time of cure, or immediately after the incision: but he should keep it away: for water rises quickly through a whetstone surface.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if it happens that there is a fever: then you should dissolve the eye before the seventh day: and straighten it with him when the scar heals, until it heals: then absolve his vision, and place it on his mouth where his vision lies under him for a few days, while he remains in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him leave the house gradually, and walk about in his rooms.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that the student is not spared from vision sometimes in the chamber: then let him listen to the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed some of them have come to us who are from Al-Arab, who said that it was done in Al-Arab by a piercing gold wire, which suctions water.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But verily we have not seen anyone in the land who has done that; nor is it written in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of the eyes, so that they stand on top of him who does not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of pure bronze; and let their ends be with this same subtle triangular shape, and the acute end.
Formae magda.	The shapes of the eyes.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	Regarding the cure for a born-with-a-sore nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	When and how different meats are added to it, some of which are absorbed by the many-legged scorpion; and from that is a kind of flesh that is scaly, pale-colored, and soft: and from that is the meat that is dull, not pale-colored.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In the places where these muscles are soft, not fraudulent, and not cancerous, you should make the sick person sit with their hands facing away from the sun, and open their nostrils, and insert hooks into those muscles: then pull them outward, and cut what you have grasped with a fine, sharp scalpel from one side, until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If anything remains of it for which it is not possible to cut off: then with one of the instruments with a small blade you can easily remove all of it until nothing remains.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	But if blood is in your power, or there is a warm hematoma: then oppose it as needed: or if it is a malignant hematoma, then approach it with cauterizing, until the blood stops flowing, and all the flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then a bit of vinegar should be applied to the nose after the cut, and water or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	But if the nose is opened, and moist air proceeds from it until the palate: then know that he has already recovered.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	But if the moisture does not penetrate, as it should, then know that within the upper bones of the nose, where the flesh has not been cut with the instrument.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then you should insert a thread of linen whose thickness is appropriate, and many knots in it: and place a quantity of a finger or less between each knot: and the sick person will let go of one end of the thread into the nose with a beam, or with whatever is possible for him to do after he has made himself similar to an azore: and he should pull on his own odorant until it reaches his palate, and come out through his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many times these young men make this device similar to an azore at school: and it is a simple thing for him who wants to do it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, the end that comes out above the nose, and the other that remains inside the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then, the surgical instrument for locking the flesh with knots that are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Then, make it so you know that the flesh is already with the knots on the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then remove the thread: and put into the nose after the withdrawal of blood, the liquid that you have soaked up in the Egyptian ointment: make it so for three days, or more, until the ointment has eaten away all that is left of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put into the tip of the thing in the nose a plumbum cannula, days several, until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however if the cure does not meet what dries up, use that one.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For the cleaning of the head, when it is poured out oil, and other medicines into the nose, make it out of silver, or brass: that it is similar to a small lamp, opened like a shell: and its edge also.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you want to make the cannula closed, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for making the head clean, is full, detected: which has a handle at the back of it, which you hold when you heat it in the oil, or what you want to extract, and fluid things.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the cure of the nose.
Caput XXV.	Head 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	The ulcer of the nose often develops in the extreme tip of the nose and increases in size over several days until it reaches a certain limit of appearance.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And for this reason, when you first see it, you must scrape off all of its surface.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then put on the place, or a causticum, or a medicine that burns in the place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If however the incision lags behind its appearance, until it increases, then consider, if it is stone, hard, bright in color, few senses: then do not touch it with iron: for it is a cancerous ulcer.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For often the same eye, which has cut the nose of the patient, and has happened from it a great evil on the part of him who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	If the apostema is mild, without a change in color, and you see that an incision can be made throughout its entire length, then wash the area with water and make the incision without fear or trepidation. Care for the wound with the same care as you would for a dry crust, until it heals over.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Regarding the suture of the nose, lips, and ears.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26: The Head.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You should know that when a rupture occurs in the continuous line of one of these cartilage structures, surgery is not very effective in some people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when this has occurred in someone, you should know that if it is a recent wound with its own blood, and you join the pain of the wound to the suture, then care for the wound itself until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	If the continuous line of the lips has already separated, and each side has become its own distinct part: then you should cut away all the skin on the surface, until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then join the two lips together with a suture and tighten them, and sprinkle dragon's blood powder and ground olibanum on the wound, and place a fragment of a plaster of diamond-hard material on top of the powder, and some other hardened plaster: and leave it bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then loosen the suture and replace the medicine, and leave it until the threads themselves have grown apart.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method for sewing is such that you gather the continuous line together, or with a needle, as we have described in the nasum suture; or you gather it with thread, as I told you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	Regarding the extraction of lumps from the lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27: The Head.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people experience hard lumps in the inner part of their lips, which are similar to grains of grass; and some of them are small, and some are large.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore you should turn the lips inside out, and locate each lump, and hang it by a hook, and cut it away from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill in the place after the incision has been made dry three times until the blood is cut off.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then soak with vinegar and treat the spot with it where the stenosis is until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	There is a wound that has come from the flesh on the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Head XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	A lot of times there is a piece of meat that comes out on the gum, which the ancients used to call an abullus.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	It should be suspended with a hook: or you should hold it with a pair of tongs, and cut it near its root, and let the blood flow or stop the bleeding.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then put on top of the place where the flesh has been dried three times, or other styptic powders, drying agents.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If that piece of meat returns after treatment, since it often returns, then cut it again and cauterize it: for this does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	The chewing of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Head XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When they are gathered together on the surface of the teeth from within and from the outside, and between the gums there are sharp ridges, and sometimes they rot, and become yellow, until the corruption spreads to the gum, and the teeth are rotten because of it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	It should be that you sit the sick person between your hands, and his head in your lap, and grind the bone and the tooth where you see the nerves, and what is like sand: until there remains nothing of it, and likewise do with the blackness, the yellowing, the citroniness, and other things until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If then what is removed from them from the beginning of the grinding is good, and if not, then you should grind them again on the other day, the second time, and the third time, until you have completed the last work on them that you wish to do.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And you should know that the tooth is hard to grind with different shapes and figures: second, because it is prepared for your operation: next, because the grinding tool with which the tooth is ground from the lower part is different from the grinding tool with which it is ground between teeth, according to different shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these shapes of razors are prepared with you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	¶ On the extraction of pain from teeth.
Caput XXX.	Head XXX.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that you heal the tooth from its pain with all effort, and be hasty in eradicating it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For the tooth does not become soft when it is eradicated: for its substance is brittle: until such time as there is no excuse for the eradication of it, then you should consider to extract it, if it grows stiff, and certify with you, the đauing tooth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For many times the pain deceives the sick, and he thinks that the pain is in the tooth and eradicates it himself: then the pain does not retreat until the tooth is eradicated that is sick.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen this from the operation of bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	Then, when the tooth that is sore is certified with you, then it should be made a sacrifice in the circumcision of the tooth with the spatulum, in which there is some virtue, until it has been relaxed from all parts: and then move it with your fingers, or with subtle forceps at first, until you cut it off.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then, when the tooth has been cut off from it, then you should put good locations on it and close the head between your knees: which you have held well so that it does not move: then pull the tooth by its right line, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If then it does not come out, then take some of their instruments and put it under it from all sides with ease, and try the movement of it, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If then the tooth is pierced or corroded: then it should be filled with cloth: and you should hold it with a small end of the forceps, so as not to break it at the time of your tightening on it with the forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And you should consider that you do the scarification in the circumcision of the gums from all parts much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And guard your strength that you do not break it, and leave a part of it, and return to the pain from the same malice that is greater in the sick one at first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And so, do not do what the phlebotomators do, in their haste, and their boldness in eradicating it, except that they administer to it what we have described.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For indeed they often bring about great diseases in men, which are more difficult to break, and leave behind all the roots of it, or some of its parts: or extract it with certain bones of the jaw: as we have often witnessed this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then they wash after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	That if it should happen that a flow of blood comes from the places (for indeed it often happens) then dry out some of the wound, and fill it with it: and if not, cauterize it, if it does not bring you relief.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shapes of the forceps are thin, so that their ends can reach far in at first, long and thick, so as not to split when they are pressed against a tooth: they are like the thick handles that you see, until when you squeeze them, they do not cut themselves and do not split: the thin ends, and they are made of iron ingot, or of twisted wire made from thin metal, straight ends: and their ends have teeth, some of which enter into certain things, and clamp down tightly, for sure.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when the ends become as the shape of the ear opening that is called a cuckoo, and are strong clamping.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Of the eradication of teeth, and extraction of bones of the jaw fractures.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When after the eradication of a tooth that is broken something remains, then you should put on the place with butter for one or two days, until it softens: and then enter into it with a probe, or forceps: whose ends are shaped like the ear opening that is called a cuckoo.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The shape of this forceps is as follows.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Their ends are made like a saw's tooth: or like a file.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If he therefore does not obey you at the exit with these pincers, then it is necessary that you should stop short of the root, and lift up all the flesh, and introduce the instrument which is called a small palanquin, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Set the end of the bone short, and make it a little thick; and let not the bone be moistened too much, lest it break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If then the root comes out through this, it is good; and if not, you should help it out with these other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first end, in which there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of the thin end.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	Also help with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with the other instruments and tools which have preceded in the description of the teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also sit the jolt with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, whose form is that of a twisted thin end, in which there is some thickness so that it does not break; and let it not be moistened too much.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that the instruments for teeth are many; and likewise the other instruments do not count; and the careful craftsman, by means of his own instrument, discovers the art and illness itself through its operation.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For because from the ailments there are to those for which the ancient instruments did not speak, on account of the variety of their forms.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If then the jaw is broken by the mandible, or by any other bone of the mouth, then examine on the right place with it the instrument which suits it and these pincers and forceps which I have spoken of in drawing out the root, and help with the gesture, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Set in it some thickness gradually so that it is held with it the jaw and does not move or shake, until it comes out; and restore the place with the medicines which are suitable for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then draw out the bone from its putrefaction, and heal the bone, until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the excellent locking of teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When the teeth are prominent and do not run in their natural course, they form an obstacle, and this happens especially in women and girls, that is, those who are growing.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	You should therefore consider the following.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if he has been born with a tooth that does not fit and is not locked in place, or cannot be filed: then extract it; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, which has this shape.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small chisel, and is made of iron, with a sharp end.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And your cut should be deep, so that it enters the tooth over a period of time, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that it does not displace another tooth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	But if it is prominent and exposed due to its own filing: then file it with a file made of iron, whose shape is as follows.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	It should be made of iron, and its handle should be small, like the point of a needle, as with an awl: with which the tooth is filed little by little over a period of time with ease, so that it does not displace any other teeth, and then smooth it down, in the end, trim it with some razor blades.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If the tooth is broken and it hurts the tongue: then it should be filed as well, until the roughness of the broken part is gone, and it is smooth: and then it should be smoothed down, and not hurt the tongue, or affect speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Regarding the retention of gold-filled teeth.
Caput XXXIII.	De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When there is a concussion or jolt to the front teeth from a blow, or by falling: and they cannot be held in place on it so that it does not fall off: and they have been treated with harsh medicines, and the treatment has not helped: then invent a device to hold them in place with a gold wire: because gold turns yellow, and rots after a while: but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let there be a thread of average thickness in delicacy and coarseness according to the quantity that it takes between teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the shape of retention is such that you take a thread and insert it between two healthy teeth: then sew with its two ends a thread between the teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the other healthy tooth.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the texture until you reach the side from which you began: and tightly hold your hand with delicacy and wisdom, until it does not move at all: and let your constriction be where you tighten the thread, near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the ends of the thread that are excessive with scissors: and collect both sides, and twist them together: and hide them between a healthy tooth and a rotten one, so that it does not hurt the tongue: and then let go so that it relaxes.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If it does not hold fast, or if it comes loose, tighten them with another thread, and let it remain with it for a long time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	This is the shape of teeth, and the form of retention of two healthy teeth and two rotten ones, as you see it.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes a tooth that has fallen out and comes back to its place, and remains as we have described, and does not do it except a skilled person, wise, and experienced.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a piece of bone that has become loose is caught: and it takes the form of a tooth, and is placed in its place, from which it is held fast by a thread, as we have said: and remains there, and holds fast to it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Regarding the cutting of the tongue ligament that happens under the tongue, and prevents licking.
Caput XXXIIII.	Head 32.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	And this ligament that happens under the tongue, is either natural, with which a man is born, or accidental, from an arrow that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation on it is such that it opens the mouth of the patient in his neck, and lifts up his tongue: then cut this ligament with nerve, until it is loosed from its hold on the tongue.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is some hardness and nodulation and it is due to the hardening of the wound, then strike it with a hook and find it by its width, until you hit the ligaments, and let the nodule be released.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware that there is no fracture in the depth of the flesh, and strike the artery there, and let blood flow.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then wipe it with rose water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then put under the tongue a little licorium from wool, which holds the sick one all night: so that he does not harden again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if there is bleeding, then place on the spot three times.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the blood injures you, then cauterize the place with a scalded cloth, which suits it: then care for it itself with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	The extraction of the ulcer that is under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	When there is an pustule under the tongue that absorbs little ulcers, it prevents the tongue from its natural function: and perhaps it becomes so large, until it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation in it is, that you open the mouth against the sun: and consider the pustule.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	But if you see that it is of a dark or black color, and hard, to which the sick person does not have feeling: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it falls off toward whiteness, and is moist: then strike into it with a hook, and cut it with a very sharp knife, and free it from all parts.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If the blood injures you during your operation, then place on the spot three times, until the blood is stopped: and then return to your operation, until you take out the core with its complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then wipe it with vinegar and salt: and care for it itself with the rest of the cure that suits it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	The cure of ulcers in the two amygdalar glands.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When there occur between the throat and the pharynx, that is to say, the glandular tissue which resembles angina, and occurs by itself: and they are called the two Amygdales: when you consider them with regard to the curative measures which we have mentioned in the division of the disease, and they do not heal, then pay attention.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If, however, there is a pus-like swelling, of pale colour, of little odour: then you must not touch the affected part with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if its colour is red, and its root is thick: then you must not touch the affected part with iron, fearing that there will be a flow of blood, but put it aside until it has healed.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then you shall either pierce it: or let it burst by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if its colour is white, rounded, and its root is thin: then the affected part should be sliced off.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation upon it is, that you consider before the operation whether the swelling of its skin is warm and has recovered its health entirely, or is slightly shrinking: then do this, let the sick person sit in front of the sun, and have his head resting on your lap: and open his mouth, and take his tongue between your hands, and press it with a tool whose shape is as follows.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver, or of brass, so that it is fine like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you press it with the instrument and a swelling appears on your face, and this gives pain: then take a hook, and fix it to the amygdala, and draw it out as far as you can, taking care to tug at it with the skin.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with the instrument whose shape is as follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is joined to the ears, and their tips are rounded; and it should be made of iron or of lead imbibed with oil.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not present, then cut it with a chisel whose shape is as follows.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Sit acuto ab uno parte, non acuto ad alteram partem.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And when you strike one side of the jaw, strike the other side according to the same incision pattern.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then, after the incision, rinse the sick with cold water or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if he has a bleeding, rinse him with water in which bark of the mirtil has been boiled: or leaves of the same kind from astringent herbs, until the blood flow stops: then care for him, until he heals.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when phlegmons arise in the throat, one besides the two amygdals.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Then incise them as I have described for the incision of the two amygdals, evenly.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I have already healed a woman from an abcess that had formed between her throat, which she choked on, and it was almost closed her throat; and this woman breathed through my throat, and she was forbidden to eat or drink, and she was coming close to death if it were left another day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abcess rose only as far as two branches, until they had come out of two holes in the nose.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	So I hurried and fixed one of my hooks.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled him out, and a large portion came with him.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I washed it off where it was caught in the hole of the nose.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did the same for him when he came out of the other hole of the nose.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth and pressed on her tongue; then I fixed the hook in the abcess; then I washed it out with a part of it, and there was only a little blood; so absolutely I healed her throat, and she began to drink water right away, and then she ate food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	So I did not cease to cut off that abcess after a long time: and the abcess succeeded in place of the one I had cut off, until it was prolonged too much and began to hurt her.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I therefore cauterized and removed the apoplexy between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	So he remained stationary in terms of movement: afterward, he walked away from her on one side, and I did not know what God did to her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the Incision of Apoplexy in a Patient.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII. On the Incision of Apoplexy in a Patient.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrh has descended to the uvula and has caused a apoplexy, and it is long: then that one is called the perpendicular: and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then that one is called a uvula.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When the treatment is performed with him that we have spoken of in the division, and there is no benefit to the treatment: and you will see that the apoplexy has become cool from her, and it is thin: then it should be cut.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what is collected from her is round and not long, and it is bloody or dark in color, or black, and it has no feeling: then it should be cut.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For fear is in the patient.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Then when you see her according to the method that I have spoken of from whiteness, and her length, so that the patient sits before the sun: and press her tongue with an instrument whose preceded description: then fix a hook in the uvula, and pull it down: and cut it with one or two instruments that I have spoken of in the incision of the two amygdales.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And you should not cut from her, unless that which is added to the natural end without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut from her more than, you will harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision use that which we have spoken of in the incision of the two amygdales: and take care of her, until she is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If the patient shudders from the incision: then it should be used to your advantage in cauterizing her without fear and anxiety.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the mode of cauterization for her is not, unless with sharp water: and it is, as you place her head in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument which we have said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which we told you in the chapter of cauterizing, and add to it the ashes not extinguished, and put into it the slimy matter, and fill with it this instrument whose this is the shape.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Sit the extreme of him in which the medicine is placed concauitas, like concauitas cochlearis radii.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on his uvula: and the sick man lies on his side, so that the remedy comes out from his mouth by itself from within the medicine, so that nothing goes down to his throat, and he hurts himself.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then take your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you from the first put half of it on the uvula at an hour, until you see that it is already denigrated, and sits the little by the bite of the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you want to take the habit, and roll him on the extreme of the radius, and put the habit with the medicine, and push the radius with the habit into the cannula from above, until it adheres the habit to the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times, until you get the result that you want of cauterization.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then release him: for it will be stiffer and falls after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	That if you want to take the medicine again, repeat it: and after cauterization wash around his mouth with a wet cloth in butter, and clean what is on it from the medicine: and let it sit in cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And heal outside with embrocations, and inside with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This then the form of cure is healthier than cutting and less to be feared from time.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And when it is cured with the medicine which is softer than cauterization and incision: for it is cured with the smoke-inification, in this way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take thyme, and hyssop, and oregano, and raphanus, and fennel, and chamomile, and abrotan, and other such herbs: and put them all together in a pot, or some of them in a pot, and add vinegar to it, and boil it: and sit the pot with a lid on, and put the concauing instrument over it according to this way.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver, or of brass; and let the end, wherein is the granule, be inserted into the bone, until the vapour ascends to the edge over the cannula, until the hole is much darkened.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then go back over it many times, until it has healed.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware that you do not make this cure in the beginning, when pus is present.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it adds to the abscess; and it should not be done except at the end of the abscess when it is cool.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If this instrument is not present with you, then take a cannula and fit it to the end of it so that the bone is not burnt; for the skin prevents the vapour from burning the bone; and this is good cure with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	As regards the extraction of spines and bones from the groove.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter LXXVIII on extracting spines and bones from a groove.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Many times a tooth, or a spine of a fish, or something else, gets stuck in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Then it should be extracted that which appears on top of the gums, after you press the tongue with an instrument against the sun, and tell me that it is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And if it does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, then you should make a weak sick person vomit before food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps then the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the sick person swallows a strand of numpy, or a root of lettuce, or he swallows a dry bread cracker: or he takes a dry sea sponge strand: and he ties it with a string, then he swallows it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it comes to the place where are spines or bones, and is extracted, then it goes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not go out with that which we have said: then use an instrument of lead according to this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be larger than a radium only a little, and let the end which is to be inserted into the throat be rounded, so that it may enter with ease into the throat; and let him hold his head up.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him beware of touching his epiglottis with his hand, lest he cough, and push with it the bone, or the spine, or thrust it himself with the doctor's hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But if the sick person pushes, that is better, namely because of his knowledge of the place; and he pushes from below or holds his hand with an instrument above, all this according to the quantity prepared for him, until he walks out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	(On the extraction of blood.)
Caput XXXIX.	(Head 39.)
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	(When you treat with blood-letting, as I said in the division on curing with medicines, and it does not come out, then consider whether there is a wound at the back of the throat, or whether it is by the sun after you have pressed its tongue with an instrument that I will tell you.)
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	(If then your cough falls on the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with subtle movements, with care.)
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	(If it is not possible with them: then take a closed tube and insert it into the throat as far as the back of the throat; then insert into the tube an iron bar with fire.)
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times: and let the sick person refrain from drinking water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a full drink of cold water, and open his mouth to it; and let him put his mouth on it, and let him not swallow anything from it; and let him move his mouth with it for an hour, by his own hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech immediately falls when it feels water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	(If it does not walk out with the leech that I have told you, then make the sick person sneeze with sniffles, or with a puff of wind with an instrument that I will tell you in sneezing.)
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, for it will fall by itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	(And the mode of operation is this, that you take a pipe, in which are fire-tipped tubes with holes: and let the pipe be covered with a cover, with a hole; and let one end of the tube be placed in that hole.)
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then begin the process of insufflations, and place the sick person's nose at the end of the cannula, and close his nose so that the insufflation does not escape until you know that the sufflation has reached the blood-sucker.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the blood-sucker will die soon.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not die, then perform the insufflations many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the sick person tolerate hunger, and eat broth, and other things, and do not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore it is necessary that he leave with this treatment.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the blood-sucker is extracted from the throat when it falls on top of it while suffocating.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see them: except that there is a curve that enters into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to an ear, which is called a ciconia, in which there is a sharp edge of the blade; and when it grasps anything, it does not let go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	Regarding the opening of abscesses, and their sectioning, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Head 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of abscesses, many ways of dealing with them, according to the recall of them, that is, one way, and one in this book: and they differ in the perforation of them, and in the sectioning of them from two aspects.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	Of which one kind of abscess is that which is in itself, and because it comprehends from moistures.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second mode is on account of places, in which it occurs from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For an abscess occurs in the head, it is different from an accident of abscess in the anus: and an abscess that occurs in a fleshy place is different from an accident of abscess in joints; and each has its own judgment from the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And there are abscesses that do not need to be pierced, unless they have become old enough in the blood, and its completeness; and of those there are those that need to be pierced when they are raw, and do not mature according to the completeness.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	As the sutures are close together.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For because the stitch becomes long when it is close to the sutures, and rotten what is in its circumference perhaps the ligaments are corroded or the nerves of that joint: so this is the cause of the greater contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or is a stitch in the main member: for if you delay the piercing of it, until it has healed, it will hurt him or through that main member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or is near a joint, then pierce it when immature: and do not need to pierce, the crude stitch, not fully digested, unless it is near a joint, so that it does not腐敗深層，並延长內側的解剖學，並成為一個管子，或在它的邊緣形成一個洞，它不治好。
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	You should know the time of piercing the stitch, which has healed according to the complement: and it is with the sedative pain, the recession of the fever, and the decrease of redness, and pulse, and sharpness of the head of the stitch: and the remaining signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And you should make the same piercing in the lower place of the stitches, and more prominent: and let the piercing be made by cutting along the length of the body, if the stitches are in the parts of the hand and foot, and the places of the ligaments, and nerves, and arteries, and up to the last in all equal places, which is not a reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those, however, that reflect, pierce with the piercing of that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	But when the stitch is in fleshly places: then it is better to leave off piercing it, until it has been confirmed its digestion, as we have said according to the complement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you pierce it before that member, the course of the virus will be prolonged from it, and there will be much sickness and contamination, and perhaps it will harden its lips, and its depth will grow.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some stitches are pierced according to the length of the body when there is a necessity: or according to which member it needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	It is fitting that you should make a small puncture in the small pustules and a large one in the large ones; or cut many sections of like size for the pustules.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are pustules from which the skin should be covered; and incise when it has already formed like a cloth, and has reached its term, for it is now dead: such as that which happened to many, to the swelling and the buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And there are those that cut with three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And there is one that incises like a fig leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	As the pustule in the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And there are those in which a round cut is made, and a lunar one; and like these are the cuts.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	Indeed that which has no head, such as the small superficial pustules, should be punctured with a superficial puncture, or simply flat.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is fitting that when the pustule is gross and has gathered much moisture, you should pierce it so that it does not fit and throw out all the pus at once: but remove a part of it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then cover the pustule with poultice until the next day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then remove some of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times according to a gradual progression until it comes out: especially if the person is weak in vigor, or a woman pregnant, or a young child at breast, or an old man decrepitous: for the spirit animal often resolves with the exit of the fluid: and perhaps the sick one dies, and you do not perceive him.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Beware therefore of this chapter.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your puncture, when you have pierced the pustules, you should wash with warm water: and reflect.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If then there is a small wound of the pustule, or it is a flat section, then administer with linseed from flax, or old cotton.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if there is a large pustule, and the puncture holes are many, then at that time you should introduce linseed into all the cracks, until they have closed up completely.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut off a part of the skin in an aplastic way, or have circumcised it: then you should fill it with new skin, or as when the cloth is woven together, or the down is scattered away without moisture: and bind it tightly until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then you will cast him off, and cure that with him which needs to be done with ointment, until he is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	But if there should happen to be a flow of blood during your operation, then you will administer cold water and vinegar, after it has been soaked up by the cloth: and lay him down on the spot of the bleedings many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	But if the bleeding persists, then you should administer the cure, and the regimens, and the powders, which are recorded in many places of our book, and from separation.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	But if it is in the time of winter, and the place of the cut is many nerves: then you should fill them with wine, and hot oil: and lay them on the places.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in the summer, and the places are fleshy: then you should lay them on the powder soaked with water, and oil, or with wine and oil, and all of that cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we have said, then you should remove the aplastic and clean him up, and administer to him which needs to be done to his cure, until he is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the understanding of the cure of aplastic wounds in general.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	However, according to the degree of distinction, I have already said about all types of aplastic wounds, which is a way to the cure of each one separately.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Regarding the section of aplastic wounds that occur on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	Head, 51.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Aplastic wounds that occur on the skin of the head are small, and are of two kinds, which are nodules, which are enclosed by membranes, which are as if they were little bags of chickens.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many species among them.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	There are some which are thin: and there are those who retain a moisture similar to lime: and there are those who retain a moisture similar to flour and pulp: and there are similar ones, and among them are hard stones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the cutting of all of them, and their extraction is not fear, when the cutting of them is not contrary to the artery.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their cutting is as you experiment with it by instrument, whose form came after this, which is named Intramuscular, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if that one is which contains moisture, then dry up the section after the length of the superficial section: in this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the section from line B to line G. And so when the moisture is emptied out, then scrape out the skin which contains that moisture, and do not leave anything of it intact.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	Many times returns if there remains anything of it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And then dip the cotton in ointment Egyptian, if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill with it a sponge, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For that stone corrodes whatever remains of the skin.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	And then repeat over the cotton cotum with Egyptian oil second time, and third time, and if you tolerate that, until you are confident that there remains nothing of the skin, then indeed care for the wound with ointment, until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	That if it contains a nodule that is swollen: then dry up the wound according to this form, having a cross-shaped section: and throw away the nails between the two sections, and scrape out the skin completely: and try your skill in extracting the skin which contains the stone.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	But if it creates a contradiction for you, then do what I will tell you after.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And also do the same in an apoplexy, if it is a stone, from the section, and with the same cure, according to what we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the incision above the stone is easier: because there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes some of these stones are in the head of some men, where there is no humidity within.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is: because I followed over the stone in the head of a married woman, and I found the stone like a solid and hard, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if it were struck by someone falling, he wounded himself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other, indeed, the accidents of stones in the head, except for these stones that happen in the heads of boys and at the roots of the ears, all their sections are superficial sections.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or put a piercing through them always from their lower part, so that the course of blood may flow to the bottom.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then take care of them with what is due to them in the curing.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	On the Section on the Striae in the Neck:
Caput XLII.	Head, 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These stones often occur in the neck, and under the shoulders, and in the groin: and sometimes they occur throughout the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And over those which occur from them in the neck, there is one kind and many: and they spring from one another; and every Striae springs from within its own skin, as we have related.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the kinds of these stones are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	For some of them are stones: and some of them contain moisture: and some of them are evil, so that they do not obey the cure.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In that one which you see is of good disposition in touch, whose color is manifestly close to the skin's color, and moves to all parts, and does not join with the nerves of the neck, nor with the guide-vessels, nor with the arteries, nor is it deep: let it be separated from its superficial section from the upper part to the lower part of the body along a line, c. to the line, g., and scrape it off entirely: and extend two skin lips with a hook, or with many hooks, if you can bear it, as we have said in the case of the stones in the head, and pull it out little by little.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	It is necessary to take great care so that it [the wound] does not hit a vein or nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And the knife should not be sharp enough to cause an opening quickly: so that it does not take your hand with an incision, or disturb the sick person, and you fall into something that is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If you hit a vein or an artery, or if it prevents you from operating, then place the wound on a log, or some powder that stops the blood, and tighten the wound, and let it go until the sharpness passes and the wound softens: or it may begin to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For the blood is stopped by the poultice. So get ready for your operation when you are finished.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then examine with your index finger to see if there is anything left of the stigmata of the stings, and then cut them and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If there is a large vein at the root of the stings, then you must not hit it from its root: but you should bind it with a strong twine and let it go until it falls of itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old cotton that has already been soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of the wound.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If you hit all of the stings, then you should gather the two lips of the wound together and immediately bind it up as soon as you see that there is no excess.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If you see that there is excess because of the size of the stings, then you should consider cutting off its root and pulling it out: and administer the suture that I have described.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And if any of the stings contain moisture, pierce it with a shallow puncture: so that you can see the place of maturity of it: and put the puncture away from what follows below the body, as I have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer liniment after the puncture with ointment, and similar things so that it corrodes whatever remains of corruption, until when you see the wound has healed on its own: then take care of the wound with a gentle ointment made from flesh, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	On the section of the epiglottis from an accident inside the throat.
Caput XLIII.	De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancient ones called this section of the epiglottis, and no one in our land has seen it done, who can explain it to us; and this is the writing of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	In those who have a swelling, the section of the epiglottis should be removed, since it does not help in any way, because all the windpipe and lung are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a hot swelling in the throat or mouth, when there is no disease in the canal, one should use the section of the epiglottis to escape the destruction that is caused by the pre-formation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we want to remove it, let us pull the epiglottis out with a small piece of wire between two circles according to its size, that is to say, a section in siffac, not in cartilage: and this place is suitable for the section, because it is separated from the flesh, and the blood vessels are far from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the doctor is timid, then he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he will find the skin, when it reaches to the canal: he should tie the blood vessels, if he sees any of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then let us cut the siffac that we mentioned above: and let it be shown on the section of the canal from the mucus that comes out of it when it is stopped up, and with the loss of voice by cutting off.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And let the opening be left open at some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the swelling goes down at some time, the two lips of the wound will be joined together again, and it will heal on its own without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then he should administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	Says Albucasis. The summary of this message which we have mentioned, is not, unless you know that some of the accidents which we have described above has already been relieved by the weakness of the throat: and it was raised up on death, and it wished to cut off its life-breath: therefore they advised to leave open the opening, until the evil in the illness is consumed, and this evil is three days, and almost as itself: so then they advised to close the opening, and to care for himself, until he is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And this, which I myself saw, that a servant girl took a scalpel and put it into her throat, and cut with it the side of the lung canal.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to cure her, and I found her to be making a sound like one who is dying.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	So I removed the wound, and I found the blood that had come out of the small lung wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	So I was confident that she had not lost much blood, nor was there any danger: and wind came out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	So I took off the bandage, and examined it carefully, until it was healed: and nothing happened to the servant girl, except that she had a hoarse voice: and after some days she recovered her health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	So therefore I say: there is no fear in cutting the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Concerning the incision of the hernia in the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	Head 44.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This hernia, called the hernia in the throat, is a large one, of the colour of the body, and it occurs frequently in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it has two causes: or it is natural, or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly there is no talent for it in the natural.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	But accidental is certainly of two kinds, one of which is similar to the nodules on the tongue, and the other is a protrusion.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other kind is similar to the hernia which is formed from the swelling of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in it is danger, and you should not make a supposition about it with the iron, unless it is small: but you test it, and investigate it with an instrument.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	But if you incision on it is like a large nodule, and is not suspended by any vessels: then cut off the nodule as you do others: and if it is in a bag, take it out with it, if it is in a bag: and if not, then examine it all over.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with it, so that it may heal, until it is cured.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	On the sectioning of nodules.
Caput XLV.	Head XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many types of nodules, and I have already mentioned all their types in detail: but it is necessary that I should mention here the difference between a nodule and an ex irritation, with which there is sometimes difficulty.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say then, that if ex irritation is accompanied by heat, fever, and painful symptoms, until the fluid overflows and putrefaction is complete: for then the fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	But if the nodule is not accompanied by heat, nor fever, nor pain, and retains its own sacs, which are of a color like the body itself, and resemble beans or peas in shape, and are larger or smaller: then they should be handled in the same way as plums.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are of two kinds: either they are swollen, or they retain moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, as I mentioned above in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	It is necessary then, when you are dealing with nodules, that you should examine them carefully, and inquire into their nature with the aid of the instrument called an introducer, as it will come in the form of a tube in the chapter which follows this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of examining secretions and nodules is this: you should take the instrument, and introduce it into a moist place in the secretion, and with your fingers slowly move it until you are certain that the instrument has entered the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then put the last finger of your hand on the instrument according to the size of the secretion.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the introducer, and consider what comes out.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If then a moist fluid comes out running, whatever the color may be: then dry the part by means of a superficial section, as I mentioned above in the case of other secretions.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no fluid comes out in the space within the introducer, then you will know that it is fatty: so dry the part with a cross-shaped section, following the shape which I have already described to you: and hang it by a hook, and scrape off the skin carefully from all parts: and if you can, keep the container over it, so that you may remove the sound matter with a nodule.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the kista is ruptured during the operation and it is not possible to extract it whole, often it happens that then it is extracted haphazardly, until there is nothing left of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if there remains little or much of it, the second node returns after many days.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	That if you are wounded and there remains little of it: then fill the wound with some acuter corrosive powder: and tie the wound tightly, and place over it a warm poultice, and care for the wound with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	But if there is a large nodule: then cut its two lips and care for it with that which has grown in it.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	But if there is a painful pulsating new growth or not: then approach and fill the place with three times its volume of dry土, and leave it wrapped up for two days or three, until the nodule rots and the swelling subsides: then cut into what remains of the nodule.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Regarding tools from outside for cutting and drilling.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter LVI. On the head.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	From these are the forms of intramuscular injections, and they are three in number.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For from them is a large one, and from them a middle one, and from them a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let there be made from iron square-shaped ends at a distance from each other, so that they may enter the wound by a short way.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	These are the forms of experiments, and they are three in number; one is called a needle, that is, a perforator: and they are three in number.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For from them is a large one, and a middle one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They agree that they should be inserted into the cavities, exits, ducts, and abscesses from him who is between them from bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are round, flat, smooth, such as the large needle with which cushions are filled, made of amber, or copper, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And their better works are what is made from citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And also experiences are made from black lead, which are convenient so that by them experience is gained in the fists, of which there are reflections, so that they reflect with mildness to them with their reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And again there are three species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Since from them are long, from them are medium, and from them are short, according to the quantity of the width of the fist and the tightness of it.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	Form of the vinches, and there are many species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Since from them are simple ones, that is to say which has one width: and there are three species as you see, Great, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them are blind vinches: and there are three species.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them are hooks having two widths, and there are three species: and from them are hooks having three widths, and there are three species: and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of Scalpels, with which they cut and ablate nodules and pustules: and there are three species: since from them is great, medium, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities with which the section is made are acute, other extremities are not acute: and they are not placed so except that with them is done a incision in curtesy of fear of the wound, or nerve: and that it heal per it from sickness, and find some tranquility from dryness somewhat more than from ablation of pustules.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are the magda's, and there are three species.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of brass, and they are similar to the wire with which the alcohol is made: and in the long end there is a hidden spikelet: and in it runs towards the inside, and towards the outside when you see it, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	Form of the spikelets that are hidden between the fingers at the perforation of pustules: and they do not grasp them: and there are three species, great, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	Formae Ventosarum, with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, great, middle, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of brass or copper, round in shape, slightly longer than shorter, as you see; and let them be of a fine smoothness.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And let these kinds of Wind-pits be with you great and small: that you may cut off the blood by them when you have need, and then when there is no medicine present with you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them for cutting off blood in any part of the body, and do not use them except in the tender parts: like the veins of the legs, and the hips, and the veins of the arms, and the nipples, and the insides of the thighs, and the groins, and those like them from the tender veins, moist.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes from them are made small instruments like the blades of scissors, according to their form: by which blood is cut off when it flows from a bleeding place, or when a wound is cut in a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	**Về chăm sóc núm vú ở người, những nơi giống như núm vú ở phụ nữ:**
Caput XLVII.	Chương đầu tiên về chăm sóc núm vú ở người, những nơi giống như núm vú ở phụ nữ:
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Khi núm vú của người nào đó phồng lên vào lúc nửa đêm (tức là khi bắt đầu ra mồ hôi trong giấc ngủ) cho đến khi chúng giống như núm vú của phụ nữ: và vẫn còn ẩm ướt.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Vậy ai ghét sự việc này, thì nên cắt nó ra khỏi núm vú bằng một vật nhọn vào lúc trăng tròn, theo hình dạng này từ đường chữ B đến đường chữ G: sau đó da khô toàn bộ phần nướu.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Sau đó chà lên nó bằng thuốc tẩy thịt có chứa nhão.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Sau đó bôi hai mép vết thương với thuốc thắt và chăm sóc nó cho đến khi lành lại.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Nhưng nếu núm vú sụt xuống về phía dưới và mềm đi vì kích thước của nó, như thường xảy ra ở phụ nữ: thì nên tìm hai đầu phía trên của nó với hai đường chéo giống như hình trăng tròn, mỗi đường dài bằng một nửa đường chữ B đến chữ G: và mỗi đường giữ một đầu của núm với nhau, để tạo thành một đường thẳng lớn hơn, theo hình dạng này từ đường chữ B đến đường chữ G: sau đó da khô phần giữa hai mép, và bỏ đi nướu, và thực hiện những việc tôi đã nói về vết rạch và bột, điều cần thiết trong quá trình chữa bệnh, cho đến khi lành lại.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If, however, you do not wish to make the incision necessary for incising him, because of his infirmity or because of the flow of blood: then you should fill the wound with a corrupting ointment immersed in linen, and leave it until it is corroded by what remains of the pus.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the patient, until he is healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	[Regarding the pustule that occurred during the tyranny of Titilius].
Caput XLVIII.	Head 58.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These pustules that occurred during the tyranny of Titilius are of the hard type of staphylococci, which contain pus, and from which comes the moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Which, therefore, are of those that contain moisture, should be cut with a lunar section, according to this form: from line b to line g, and so, when all that is in the pustule has been drained, then fill it with old linen, and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the linen should be removed, and care taken with a suitable ointment to suit the patient, until he is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the pustule is of the type of nodules of staphylococci, then cut over it as we have said in the section on Staph-like nodules that are equal.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If, however, the wound extends in this way so as to emit pus, then administer a causticum to it, according to what we said in that which precedes.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	[Regarding the incision of a pustule due to an artery or vein].
Caput XLIX.	Head 59.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When the artery is broken and the skin above it is hard, it often happens that a pustule develops there: and likewise it happens with veins, so that it happens to them as well as a pustule and swelling.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that the pustule and swelling are due to an artery and a vein, are these: for when the pustule is due to an artery, it is long, collected in the depths of the body; and when you press the patient's finger, you feel as if there were a hissing sound.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is for the vein, is round in the manifest body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the cut on this apostematon is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and in the groin, and around the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very great.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, since it should be taken care of with iron, and because it is also in the extremities, or in the head, it should be taken care of.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	On that then which is from it out of the inflammation of the opening of the artery, find in the skin in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with a hook, then the artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is detected.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce underneath it and let it penetrate until another side, and tighten the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then poke the place which is between the two ligaments with a needle, until all the blood which is in it comes out, and the apostematon is solved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer the cure which generates pus, until the ligaments fall: then care for that with ointments suitable for it, until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If the apostematon is due to a vein section, then you should hold your hand, if it is possible for you from the pustule with skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce a hook underneath the place which you held with your hand, and let it penetrate: and let it be in it a double thread, until you bring out yourself from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then bind with that pustule with a good ligament: according to what I told you about the ligament of a thread, from two parts with its two extremities.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If, however, you should happen to extract a thread, then introduce another hook with another thread under the pustule entirely from the cut of an awl: press down, and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry the pustule from the middle, until when it comes out what is in it: then cut off the excess of skin, and let go what was bound with it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put a very thin piece of pulli over the wound that you immersed in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer the cure, which is done with liniments and ointments, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	¶ If anything happens from a扭伤 (twist injury),
Caput L.	head L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	As happened in an artery and vein, so also happened in nerves: either from a punch, or from excessive work, and similar: and it often happens in places of help, or of heels, and in any place where the joints move: and it is a gray apoplexy.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain: and when it is squeezed with a tremor, it feels in it a similar stupor.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And is not an apoplexy that集在身体的深处，但是在皮肤下， 并移动到所有部位，  ולא报告前部， 或前面， 或后部。
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	So whatever is in the joints does not need to be moved with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps however a contraction may happen.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In that however which is in the head or forehead, find skin with a touch of sensitivity.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If then is a little apoplexy, then hold it with forceps, and cut it off from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if is a great one, then hang it by a hook, and scrape it off: then remove it, and join the wound with a stitch: and cure it, until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	¶ About the section of apoplexies that happen in the belly.
Caput LI.	Head L.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Some people often get a lot of warts in their throats and other parts of their bodies, which they call 毒疮  (wart), by reason of similarity of these to fungis.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Their root is subtle, and the head is gross, and their lips are thick.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And it is a little of them: and it is one of them that grows very big.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I have indeed seen a man, and in his abdomen there were two little glands, which were more than other similar fungi: there was no difference between them, they were white, minute roots, and their lips were turned in, and they were falling, and moisture always ran out of them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	So I cut them open and found in the weight of one a little over ten and eight ounces and in the other a little over six ounces; and the operation in cutting them open is this, consider then, if he is weak, moist, and the color of the glands is white, moist, with fine roots: then cut him open with a wide chisel, and have before you the cautery on fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often much blood is discharged during the operation: so if your blood runs, then cauterize him.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see him weak and terrified of the incision with the iron, then take a piece of lead carefully made, and tie it with a thong: whose mode is that which I have said, and let him go for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the tightness of the lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	So do not cease to tighten the lead, when it presses on the glands, until it is cut off, and falls by itself without work.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If, however, the glands are large roots, then there is some fear and terror in their incision: especially since it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible that you cut half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize him, so that he does not bleed.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of the wound, until the sore heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And do not suppose that the glands, which are of a reddish color, few senses, and an appetizing appearance: for indeed it is a cancerous apoplexy: and I come to mind with regard to Krebs after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	§ On the treatment of a prominent umbilicus.
Caput LII.	Head II.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The prominence of the umbilical may result from various causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from a fissure of the skin, which is above the abdomen: and comes out from it white, or intestinal, depending on whether it occurs in the remaining abdominal ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Of blood that flows from a vein, or from an artery, according to what has been said above.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from a constricted pulse, in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If, however, it is due to a crack and the discharge is foul: then it is like the color of bruises similar in color to the body: and it is soft, without pain: and appears at different places.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the exit of the intestine, then its site, with what we have mentioned, varies in a greater degree.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When you press the wound with your fingers, it is hidden: then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it becomes very loud at the entrance to the vein, and the pain increases.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If, however, it is due to moisture, it is soft, then it does not hide when pressed with your hand, nor does it tighten, nor does it increase.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	That if it is due to blood, then with these signs appears a bruise towards darkness from the edge.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	But if it is due to born meat: then it is a gray, thick, hard bruise, and figures according to the quantity of one unit.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If, however, it is due to airflow, then the touch of it is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in it is, to consider then, if the prominence of the umbilical is due to blood of an artery, or a vein, or airflow: then one should refrain from treating it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in that is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter where I said about bruises due to an artery and a vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	That if the prominence of the umbilical is due to intestines or a hernia: then you should instruct the sick person to hold his breath and stand erect with his arms outstretched.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then the signs with caustic around the umbilical of all.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then instruct him to lie down between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then with a sponge wet with water on the circumference of the umbilical over the place you have marked with the caustic.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend slightly below the axilla towards the upper part, with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind it around firmly with a strong thread, or with a silk string with a firm knot; and let the knot be attached to the axillary ligament.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open slightly the section extended above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	But if you have already found it captured by the ligament: then pull out the axillary and insert your finger into it, and press the intestines towards the inside of the abdomen: and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook and cut off the excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	But if the opposite artery is for you or the vein: then surround it very much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles and insert two strong threads into them: and introduce the two needles around what you have made around the abscess in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tighten the abscess in four places on the needles: and if you want, remove the needle, and leave the space until the flesh that is extended rot, and it falls away by itself: or cut it when it thins out and rots.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the abscess with what you need from ointment, until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	That if there is a prominence at the navel from flesh or from moisture: then it is necessary that you tighten the abscess, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And draw out blood, or moisture, which you pour into it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then take care of the abscess with what you need to strengthen the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	For the cure of cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken about the division of cancer and how it is cured with medicines, and how to guard against its cure with iron so that it does not ulcerate: and we have spoken about cancer generated in the womb and caution in its cure.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that whenever cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated: like cancer in the乳房or thigh, and similar places from member located to remove all of it: especially when it is beginning to form a mass.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When it is very old and great, it is not necessary for you to approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I could not heal out of it any one; nor did I see another before me who had come to it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when it is placed as we have said, is that you should go before it and sometimes heal the sick of black cholera.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then the bloodletting from itself if the inflammation is evident with swelling.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the sick with preparation, in which it is placed with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then throw on to the cancer the hooks that are appropriate for it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then cover the whole of it with the skin, according to the scratching, until none of its roots remain: and allow the blood to run out, and do not cut it off quickly, but rather express the places, and wipe away the gross blood with your hand, or with whatever is there, as much as possible.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if the opposite happens to you and the flow of gross blood comes out from the incision of an artery or a vein: then causticate it until the blood is cut off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the rest of the cure on the wound, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	On the cure from water-disease:
Caput LIIII.	Head XXIV.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already spoken at length in the division of the types of water-disease, and how the aggregation of water takes place: also the signs of each type, and the cure with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is cured with the iron, is not but one kind of asclysis: and it does not approach iron of the kind of timpanitis: nor does it go deeply into the kind of hyposarcia, for that is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this species of water-disease with iron and the medicine has not helped you: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the sick is already debilitated, or there is another kind of infirmity besides water-disease: such as if it has a cough, or a fever, and other things similar to these: then do not cure it with iron, for fear befalls it.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see a sick person with abundant virtue, and there is no sickness with him but only hydropisis: and he is neither a boy nor an old man: then the mode of operation with him is, that you should take the sick person standing between your hands, and the minister after him should press out his wind from his hand driving water to the lower part of the plastron.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a spatuled with thorns, shaped like this.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Set down two acute parts, long, the acute end of it like a spatuled.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	But in it place something that is slightly curved, so that you do not hurt yourself with it while operating near the intestine, and let it fall.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the generation of hydropisis is from part of the intestines, then it should be that you lengthen with a section three fingers' width from the navel, to the lower in straight line above the plastron.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	But if the generation of hydropisis is due to liver sickness: then your section should be on the left side three fingers' width from the navel.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of it is due to spleen sickness, then your section should be on the right side: and it is not necessary that you make a section in the place where you want to lay the sick person, so that fluids do not run to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce with an instrument all the skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce into it the section, and press with your hand with Spatemile between the skin, and rub, as if you were cleaning it out: and let be the quantity that is scrubbed a quantity of nail, or around it.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the Sifac, until Spatemile reaches to the empty place: and that place is a place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then take out the person, and introduce into a hole an instrument, which has this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a tube: it is made of silver, or brass, or gold, smooth, round: and in its lower part there is a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes, two from one side, and one from the other side: and its end should be incised, according to the way of incision of the reed, as you see it: at its upper end there is an armilla.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	When the instrument has reached the water, then immediately it [the blood] comes down on the instrument; so therefore it should be dried from the water at an intermediate time.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Since if you were to drain it more than is necessary, perhaps in an hour the sick one dies of a resolution of his animal spirit; or something happens to him that approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But drain it from it according to the strength of its pulsation and according to what you indicate to you concerning the dispositions of nursing with its pulse and its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then take out the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	That is, because it is retained immediately on account of the skin which retains the pore that is over the syringe: wherefrom I tell you that you should perform it according to that mode.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on the other side if you see that the sick one can tolerate that: and also take out from the water a quantity of the pulse.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do that on some days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there remains in it from the water only a little bit.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you are to work on the sick one, and let go of a lot of water: then take care for him with burial in hot sand, and with much sweating in bathing and sun, and he should wait for thirst: and take care for him with dried-up doctors, until he is healed: and cauterize over his stomach, and his spleen, and his liver, after taking out the water: according to what I tell you about that which precedes.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Regarding the care of infants who are born in places where their bladders are not pierced.
Caput LV.	Chapter LV:
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any infant emerges from the womb of its mother, and its head of the muton is not pierced, or its pore is narrow, or it is not in its place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Then you should help with the piercing of it immediately when it is born with a fine needle and water, according to this form:
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put into its pore a small clamp made of lead, and tie it up: and hold it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When therefore he would urinate, let him move and go forth.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then take away his urine.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put lead on him, it is possible that the urine which has run over the place should not prevent him from going away.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But he whose hole is tight, is healed with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	But those in whom the hole is not in its proper place are harmed.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is, because from him who is born, the hole is at the end of the penis: so that he cannot urinate in front, until he raises his penis by hand to the top.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	And there is no generation in him, therefore, so that the seed cannot come to the womb according to its right course: and it is a great foul disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the mode of action in him is that he lies down on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend his penis by your left hand with a strong extension, and strike the head of his penis from the proper place with an edge, or a sharp chisel: as is the cut of a pen, or like you cut something, so that it may come to resemble the head of the penis in shape, and may fall into its middle, according to what is required.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And cause yourself not to have a flow of blood during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	So he cuts it with him who severs the blood, and takes care of the wound, until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	As for what happens to the prepuce and the head of the penis, and corruption, blackening, and adhering,
Caput LVI.	The head.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These matters often happen to the penis, and the flesh becomes great with foul meat.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from this there is a bad thing, and another that is not bad.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	So you should hang it by a small hook, and cut it off entirely.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then put a cotton ball soaked in Egyptian ointment on it.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with the oil of vitriol, until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	That if the albather is malicious and of a foul color, then you should administer cauterization after incising it and shaving it.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If, however, the albather is captured in the prepuce and not circumcised, and is part of the albather within the prepuce and part of it outside: then you should remove the albather that is within first, until it hardens, then care for the one outside: for when you care for it at the same time, the prepuce does not secure itself unless it is pierced.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And also happen and also in the testicles, and the prepuce black and corruption.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, you should bring together all that has been diminished, and what wishes to be corrupted, or that which has already been corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then put a line of honey on the wound that has already been crushed with flour from a miller's sifting apparatus and herb from a cribbler's sifting apparatus.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the remaining cure, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If, however, a flux of blood occurs, then administer cauterization with lunar cauldron, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For the cauldron is helpful in two ways at the same time, that is, for the flow of blood and for the wound when it corrupts.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	That if it corrupts the head of the penis and destroys all in an hour: then you should insert a plumbi apium canal into the meatus primum, so that it can dribble on it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	However, the prepuce adheres to the head of the penis, and this type of adhesion does not occur unless the prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not required on it: and when adhesion occurs due to injury or apoplexy: you should therefore scrape it off with a blunt Spatumili, until the ligament is released, and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish them exquisitely, then one should cut something out of the head of the penis, and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	That is, because when the foreskin is delicate, it may be pierced quickly because of its lightness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate between the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water so that it does not stick again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat with astringent wine until it hardens.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	The washing of babies and the cure for error by accident.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a cure for continence, as are the other wounds; nevertheless, since it is the result of our desire and its use is proper to boys, we must mark this operation as superior and more beneficial, leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I therefore say that the ancient ones did not write about circumcision in any of their books; for they do not use such things in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired this knowledge through experimentation.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	That is, because I have discovered most of the arts, and the use of phlebotomy and washing, circumcising with a knife, and binding with thread, and incising with a nail. They use leech, and ligature by twine, and cut with scissors.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have already tested all these methods, and I did not find a better washing than circumcision with a knife and binding with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For when washing with a leech, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	For the foreskin has two skins; so perhaps one skin is cut, and the other is wrapped in a cloth; so it is necessary to consider cutting the second one as well, with the pain that would result.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when washing with a leech, that is, with the finger, as surgeons do, an incision made at the end of the male member does not secure it; because perhaps it enters a hole in it.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	But in the washing of the foot with the nail, maybe he has rusted the iron and has ruined your operation; and the skin of the boy is by nature short, and many times are born like this so that they do not need washing; but I have already seen it.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	But in the washing with the pincers and the bandage with a thread, a good experiment has shown to me: because the pincers are proportionate to the incision: indeed, the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	But when you press your hand, two sharpnesses are proportionate and incise one according to the operation at the same time: and a compression of similar figure is made, containing the skin of the arm from all parts, with which no error falls at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the mode of the operation is its own, so that you may guess it out, especially if he is from among those who understand a little, which you do not do, unless you tie the thread in his arm alone: and let him go until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then may he rejoice and be glad in all ways as much as possible for you, since he receives intelligence of it.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your hands that are prepared to stand, and not sitting down: and hide the pincers in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that he does not see them at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then introduce your hand into his arm, and blow on the skin, and pull it up until the head of the arm comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then wash it from him since it is gathered in it with filth.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then tie the lower part with the same sort of ligature as before.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold it with your index finger and retain the lower ligature well with your thumb, and incise between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then wipe the skin quickly upwards, and take out the head of the arm.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros. Recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood run slowly (for it is better so), and put on the powder from above. And over the powder put a cloth in which is spread out the flesh that has been cut and cooked in rosin water, concussed with rose oil. Afterwards leave it on itself until the next day: and take care of the rest by cure, until it is well.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The form of the forceps for cleaning this is as follows.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	The two ends should be turned towards the inside and they should meet each other: let no splint go into it like a bar of the claw: and make the length of the two acute angles equal to the length of the two hands equally.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	But a mistake that is made in cleaning is this: for perhaps it shuns all of the inner skin, or part of it near the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore you should spread it out from your hour with your nail before the site of the incision: and let it fall according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your nail, then take it out with a forceps and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If however it has passed over three days and remains what is under the swollen branch, incision: then let go of it until the sore is well, and scrape it off easily, and cut it according to how you have prepared it for yourself: and caulk you from the head of the branch.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For that will not harm it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Take care therefore that the bone is healed with the powder, which we discussed in the book on powders: and if it is incised from the skin above the line, and grows up towards the top, it also does no harm to it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Take care therefore for what we have said until it is well.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	De extractio of retained urine in bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retained urine in the bladder, is caused by a deposit made from a stone, or congealed blood, pus, or flesh born, and similar things which we have discussed under different methods of cure.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the Vrina is not relieved, and you see that it is because of the Stone which has already become attached to the neck of the womb: then it is necessary that he be made sick on his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then he shall set his feet upon his back, and shall stretch forth his belly from the upper part of his back, and shall press down his sickness as much as it is possible for him to do.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Then it is considered with the neck of the womb towards the expelling of the Stone to the rear: why is the Vrina relieved?
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	Which if it is not relieved with this that I have said, and the sick one is a problem: then it is necessary that you administer the extraction with a tool, which is called a syringe, whose this is its form It is made of silver, and let it be fine, soft, and rounded like the feather of an owl in fineness, long like the palm of a hand and half again as long; and has in its head a fine tube.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the way out of the Vrina through itself is that you take a double thread, and tie it well in its end with wool, or cotton, good knot: and you introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and you cut with nippers if there is anything excess from the wool, but really introduce into the tube with shaking, as you raise.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then dip the syringe in oil, or in butter, and in alum poultice: and make the sick one sit on a chair, and insert the womb, and his rod with the wet oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then introduce the syringe into the rod easily, until it reaches to the root of the rod.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double itself on the upper side from the ombilicus.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe inside until it reaches the bladder, and let the sick one feel that he has reached the empty place: and this does not happen according to this order, unless because of the passage, in which you insert, is in the place where there is a bend.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the filament slowly with wool.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	Then follow the thread of the wound with the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then extract it, and make the thread run along the urethra: and again go to the bladder, and do not cease doing this, until the urine is discharged, and the pain is eased.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	De quality of the enema of the bladder with the clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Head LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When there is an ulcer in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is caught up in it, and water and medicines are to be distilled into it: then do with the instrument which is called a clepsydra, and this is its shape.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is a closed vessel, that is to say, a cistern.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three openings, two on one side and one on the other, like the eyes.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concaved place, in which is the thing that drives it without addition, until when it is drawn with it there is something attracted from the moisture: and when it is driven, along with it far away: second because it does the clepsydra, through which naphtha is thrown, that is to say, Greek fire in battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When you are about to throw water into the bladder, introduce the end of the clepsydra into the water, and draw it out with what drives it upward: for water is drawn into the concaved place of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce its end into the urethra, according to what we have said about the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then drive the water with it, so that it comes to the bladder immediately, so that the patient feels it:
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The shape of a delicate enema with which the bladder is enameled.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Be it of silver, or of copper-alloy: and its handle should be a little higher than the base, and under it a groove in which the thread runs along.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the urine of a lamb, and put it into it the moisture, whereby the wound will be washed.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind it between two knots with strong knotting twine: and heat it slightly in the moisture over a fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the end of the catheter into the urine, then tighten your hand on the uesicam with the moisture so that it does not leak, until the sick person feels better, which means that the moisture has already reached the wound.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	But if you do not have present urine, then take a fragment of parchment, and make it into a circle, and pierce it from all its circumference.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then introduce a strong twine into these holes, as they rotate.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then collect the circle, as is collected alsofrustum: once you have put in it that which you take out of moisture, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind the twine to the instrument: and do so with your hand as you did with the urine for expression with your hand, until the moisture has reached the wound.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	§ On the extraction of Stone.
Caput LX.	The Head of Chapter L.X.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	I have spoken on the division of the species of stone, and on the cure of it with medicines: and I have spoken on the difference between the stone that is generated in the kidneys, and the uesica, and the signs of both: and I have spoken on the stone that is generated in the urine by hand, and on the section: and this is a stone that is generated in the uesica properly: and that which is formed on the thorns: and I am telling it with an evident and abbreviated exposition.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say, then, that stone generated in the uesica, often happens to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And of the signs of it is that urine flows out from the uesica like water in its subtility: and appears in it white sand, and chafes the sick man's uesicam, and suffers with it, and often hangs.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it erects itself, and flows out with it the anus in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	It is easy to heal boys as long as they are not more than fourteen years old.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult to heal the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	But in youths it is medium, because it is between that and this; and the healing is easier if the stone is larger: but if it is small, the cure is delayed.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	But when we come to the healing, it is necessary that we should first make the sick one free from all the dung which is in his bowels: for this sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the sick one be taken with his feet, and be shaken and moved to the lower parts: that the stone may go down into the deep of the loins, or sometimes jump out of its high place.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then let him sit with his hands prepared between your hands, and his hands under his hips, so that the whole loins may go down into the place of the bowels.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him and touch him from without.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	But if you feel the stone in space, then at once approach with a cutting section above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then you should wipe the index finger with oil from your left hand, if the sick one is a boy: or the middle finger if he is a complete youth: and let him put himself in some part of his body, and examine the stone until it stands under your finger: and turn it little by little towards the throat.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press on it with your finger and push it towards the outside against the place where you want to section it off: and instruct one minister to press the groin by his hand, and another minister to extend the testicles by his right hand from above: and with his other hand, to move the skin which is under the testicles in that part where the sectioning is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then introduce a spatulum which has this shape.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between the loins and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the left side: and let the section be made over it so that the stone can come out from it easily, according as its exit may be larger, if it may come out.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps the finger, which is in the anus near the incision, has been compressed and has been removed without any difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you should know that from the stone are the angles and edges, which is why it is difficult to remove it because of those.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And out of it comes something soft, similar to a gland, and round: and the exit of it is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	So add to that which has angles and edges, into the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it is not removed in this way, then one should invent a device for it: or you can twist it with an awkward gesture, whose end is like the Moon, which twists over the stone and does not slip from it: or as you insert a thin instrument under it, with a curved end.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If you can't reach it from above, then slightly widen the hole.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If something makes you bleed, cut it off with a scalpel.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	But if the stone is more than one, then push in the first big one into the rectum.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut on top of it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push in a small one after it, and do the same if there are two or more.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If it is very large, then ignorance is how to cut off from the top with a big incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Since it happens to an ill person of the two things, or that he dies, or because frequent urine passes through him: soon, since the place does not consolidate at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer an expulsion of it until it is removed: or a device in its fracture with pincers, until you cut it off forcibly.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	But when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with thistle, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it tightly, and place a damp cloth on top of the wound, or oil rosin, and cold water: so that it may be bound by a blister.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then re-bandage the sick person on his neck, and do not remove the bandages until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	And so when you have solved it [the wound], immerse the place in water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with unguent of daphnic and basilic until it heals.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	But if it should happen that the wound is infected and there is heat and corruption, and the same things: for instance, if the blood congeals in the urethra, and urine is prevented from it: and it may be known from the issue of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	So put your hand into the wound and draw out the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it may cause urinary tract infection and putrefaction of its discharge.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; and oppose any kind of thing that belongs to cure, until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And during the whole period of cure, let two pillows be placed under the legs, and let the patients lie on their backs, for medicines placed upon the spot to act.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If the stone is small and sits in the meatus of the urine, and turns in it, and prevents the exit of urine: then care for the stone with oil before you attempt to cut it out.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For often there will be no cure after an operation, for I have already tried this remedy.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And take the Perforator from iron, which has this shape, triangular ends, acute, fixed on a piece of wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and tie it to the penis under the stone so that it does not recede into the urethra.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the piercing iron into the penis with ease, until it reaches the stone: and turn the Perforator in the stone by hand little by little: and feel for the piercing, until you make it go through from one side to another.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For urine is immediately relieved.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand upon what remains of the stone from the outside of the penis.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it will break, and come out with urine, and the sick one will be healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If, however, you are not prepared for this treatment because of something that prevents it: then tie a cord under the stone, and another cord above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry off on top of the stone in the middle of the two knots.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then remove it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then loosen the knot, and clean the congealed blood, which has formed in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie a cord under the stone, unless it returns to the wound: and a cord above, unless when it is loosened, the skin returns to its place, and covers the bone: and for this reason it is necessary that you should tie the upper cord, so that the skin returns upward, so as to return at your own complement, and cover the bone, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	Regarding the removal of stones in women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Stones do not form much in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If, however, a stone occurs in any of them, then the treatment is difficult, and it is prohibited for many reasons.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One reason is that the woman might be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And a second reason is that you should not examine a woman who is engaged in marriage, or one who has husbands: for she might accuse you of attempted rape.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	A third reason is that you should not examine a woman who knows the art well, especially the hand operation: for she might recognize it and accuse you of attempted harm.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	A fourth reason is that the distance from the stone to the place where it is to be removed is too great: for there is a risk of error in the depth of the cut, and there is danger in it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity compels you to do so, then you should take a woman doctor who is well-versed in the art: and there are few of them.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	However, if you are concerned about this, then seek a married doctor who is subtle and well-versed in the art of women's affairs: and there are few of them. If not, ask a married woman who is skilled in this part of the art: and let her be present, especially when she does what you instruct her to do in the investigation of the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, whether the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that he introduce his finger into her vulva and ask for blood.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If he then finds it, he should bind it with his own hand, and then order the obstetrician to introduce his finger into the woman's vulva and ask about the blood, after he has placed his left hand on her womb and pressed it firmly.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If he then finds the stone, then it is necessary that he slowly move it from the opening of the vagina to the lower part with all his strength, until he reaches it at the root of the pelvis.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then he should wipe it off at the middle of the vagina at the root of the pelvis, preparing himself from either side, and feel the stone in that part; and his finger should not move from the stone, binding it beneath: and let a small incision be made first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he should introduce the ray above that section.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If he then feels the stone, then he should add to the second section a quantity proportional to the amount of stone discharged from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you should know that there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For this reason, some are small, others large, some smooth and some sharp, some long and some round, having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	So you should know the kind of stone, as I have explained to you about that which you desire.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, blood makes you win, then add to the place of lying three times, and hold it for an hour, until the blood is separated.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then turn back to your operation, until the stone is discharged from the vagina: and do as I have told you, preparing yourself with the instruments, which I have mentioned for removing the stone from the vagina, that you may help yourself with them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If, however, blood makes you win, and you know that the flow of blood comes from an artery that has been cut: then put powder on the place, and tighten it with the powder as it descends: and do not change it: and let go of the stone, and do not take it out.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	For a woman may perhaps die because she is weak.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then the concern for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	How then does the sharpness of the blood subside after days, and the place becomes rotted, so that you return to your operation until the stone is removed.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	§ On cutting below the hernial membrane with water.
Caput LXII.	Head LII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	Rames' water does not exist, unless there is an accumulation of moisture on the testicular skin which contains a single loop: and it is called sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And when it is in its own pannus itself, which nature has prepared for it in a certain part, until it is putrefied: that is another thing, and that skin between the white sifac is what we have said: and it does not make it except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this branch comes from the weakness that occurs in the testicles: why this substance is poured out onto them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And when it happens from a blow above the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture is having many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or indeed its color changes to reddishness, or it is bloody red, or fecundous, black, or white watery, and that which is more so: and it is that which is more.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which one can know where the accumulation of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white sifac, that we have described, then the swelling is round in length to some extent like a figure of a circle: and the testicle does not appear, because moisture contains it from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is moisture in its own pannus itself, then the swelling is round with a part of it, and for that reason men estimate that it is another thing.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls backwards.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you wish to know the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the swelling with an intruder's square, whose shape preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Accordingly, so that which is emitted from the introducer's exit, judge it to be between itself.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	So when we come to cure with iron, then it is necessary that you instruct the sick person, if possible, let him bleed and see his body well filled.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he should lie down on his back on a high bed and put many blankets under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit down on his left side and instruct the minister to sit on his right side, extending his leg between the skin of his testes and the side of the scrotum towards the pubic bone.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a wide razor and scrape the skin of the testes from middle length, up to the chest: and make the incision according to the straight line that divides the skin of the testes, until it reaches the white substance enclosed: and examine it carefully, or gently remove it, as you wish, and scrutinize it well according to quantity that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the closed sac with a wide perforation and drain out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with a hook, and extend the sac towards the top, and do not touch the skin that covers it: and cut the sac in any way possible for you to cut it, either completely, or only partly, especially the side that is thin.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not scrutinize well, there will be no security in the incision, except that it returns to the water.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if his sperm should come out of his skin during your operation: then, when you have finished the incision of the sac, reduce him.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then join together the two lips of the skin of the testes with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for him as you do for other wounds, until he is healed.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	That if there is any corruption of the sperm with other color, then you should tie the ligaments that are suspended, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testes with the suspension, and drain out the sperm: then care for it with that which I have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If, however, water is gathered in two parts, then you shall know that there are two branches; therefore dry one part as you did the other, equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal to you, so that the operation is one, then do it; and then wash away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce the wool that has been immersed in oil, or rosin-oiled, into the scrotum; and put another wool that you immersed in wine and oil on top of the two testicles, and spread it out over them, and wipe the eye with it: and then place double cloths on top, and they will be clean; and bind them together on top with a string that has six turns according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then two cloths are to be taken and spread out and filled with carmine according to this similarity: and the ends that are pressed together by a thong, or by wet wool; and they are to be gathered together with a cinch in the lumbar region of the arms: and one end is to take hold above some bone until it reaches the back, and the second end is to take hold towards the side of the ribcage: and the two ends are to rest on the two thighs below, and the other end is to rest on the two hips, and all the cinch is to be gathered together in the lumbar region of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And, whenever this rope is used artificially with a knife as a place of the section with iron: and it is, that you take a fine knife-edge knife, and separate it along with it from the skin of the testicles: and it catches fire, according to what we have described; until it can be detected by the white liquid containing water: then take the knife, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It is similar to Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce with it that little hole in the liquid, and it catches fire, until all the moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then spread out the liquid with a hook, and scrub it with a small knife that catches fire; and cut it off completely, as you are able to do, until you have removed all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And let there be no fire in the oil, lest it burn the skin.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And you should know that this operation is salutary, and longer than the flow of blood, and better than the operation with the section.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if in the hour of the section or in the hour of the cautery there is an opposito to you, or warm apostema, or a flow of blood, or something else: then it is necessary that you cure what opposito does to you with the cure which is appropriate to him, according to what has been said above.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	But if he is timid and does not expect this operation, because of its horror: then you should administer the perforation according to what I have told him: and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is certified to you by him about the ramus which is aqueous: then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit on a raised chair.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the apostema in the lower part of him with a spatumili side: and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and leave the opening wide until all the water runs out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then put a cloth on the place, and tie him up, and let him go to run out the remaining water: then care for him, until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	But if there is an opposito to the exit of water in the hour when you pierce it: and this is not unless for this reason, because the white pannicle does the opposito in the orifice of the wound, and prevents the exit of water: then you should introduce the feather into the wound, or the instrument with which the water of hydropics is removed, whose form precedes: or add a little to the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And you should know that the water returns and accumulates after six months, or about them.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it is accumulated, then it will return in the same way, and the sick person will spend his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the care of the ramus carnose.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	You should know that in the section on this ramus, there is a fear which leads to perdition in many dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	So then he left me well from her.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I remember the operation on her, and the appearance of the wound.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say then that many defects occur in the bodies, from which the testicles are made: and it comes about from many causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from acute or sharp excess, which runs to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the colour of the swelling is according to the colour of the body, and it does not be known to him pain: and the swelling is grey.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone swelling, whose colour is dark, and there is no feeling of it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it is from the nodding of arteries, and their swelling: as I have already reminded you of that: or from the swelling of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	That then which is from the swelling of arteries, is known through the position of the swelling, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary that you touch it all at once.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That then which is from the swelling of veins, does not scatter anything away from it when you compress it with your fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is also possible that this same colour should come about in a section, and on the other flesh: and it is, so as to separate the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend your hand upwards, and pull it out with a nail or something: and free the suspender from the water, and tie the rope of the suspender, and cut off the suspender after you have freed it from all parts of it under the arm.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If then the solidified flesh is with those born flesh, then you must attract the flesh and cut it off.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if the adhesion is to something in the nipple, or in what is between the nipples: then you must free all that adhesion, and cut it off with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If then the birth of flesh is in the place of the adhesion which is behind: then you must cut off all that, and pull out the flesh, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When your operation is complete, cut the wound with a blade, and fill it with oil infused with rose water and wine. Then take care of the wound itself with the remaining cure, until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	¶ On the treatment of the vine with the grape vine.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter LXIIII.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	The use of the poultice is good, wrapped somewhat with wetting, like a blister, with softening of the testicles; and it is difficult to move or exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this disease there is a fear because of the previous memory.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But we should say about the operation in it according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I will tell you that you should make the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the suspender of the testicles to the lower part.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, which are next to the scrotum: and let someone else hold it and extend it with a forceful extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a sharp knife across the legs of the scrotum, until the membrane is detected.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape all parts off, as we have told you in the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then fix it in them with a knot where the double thread is; and tie it again in the last place where the vines are.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then dry them in a straight middle section according to the length of the body, and pull out what is gathered from the腐腐的湿气。
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then take care of the wound with the remaining cure, so that the membrane which nourishes one testicle does not grow again, and let the membranes fall off.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For that is not bad in itself.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if it happens to all the vines, then you must take them out with the vines because of this cut so that they do not shut off the nourishment of the testicles, because of the incision, and do not become scarred or withered, and are not harmed by them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	¶ On the cure of intestinal ramen.
Caput LXV.	Chap-L XV .
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The ramus of this ramus is taken from the section that occurs on the right side in the extensive sigh of the small intestine at the root of the pelvis by a mirror of the thigh.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from a sigh or from an extension of it.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis. Aut ex percussione. Aut saltu. Aut clamore. Aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two types occur for various causes. Or from a blow. Or from a twitch. Or from a noise. Or from the lifting of something heavy, and others like it.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And a sign when it is from an extensive sigh.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is what happens gradually over a long period of time and not all at once: and it is a bulge equal to the depth: therefore, because the sigh compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it when it is from the section of a sigh, because it suddenly causes a painful swelling from its beginning: and it is a bulge different, appearing under the skin and near to it: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and the course of it towards the external sigh.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And when it emerges with the intestine intact: and this is called the intestinal ramus, and the bulge: and sometimes it is done with a twitch.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes it runs in the feces of the intestine and retains it there: and it is accompanied by that with a variety of diseases: because it causes a painful swelling, especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of diseases with iron there is a fear: for this reason one should guard against falling into it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of its operation is, as you command the sick person to bring his intestine by hand to his internal concavity, if he submits to return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then it was laid on top of its neck between your hands: and the legs were raised.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin to the top, and dry the skin of the testicles entirely along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then put two hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to how you want to open the incision with them: and let the incision be made according to the quantity, which is possible, so that it comes out from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the skin off, and what is under the skin of the testes, until it is found when touched that it is white all over: then insert your index finger into it where it follows the testicle, into it where it is between the white skin, and between the second skin, and firmly adhere to it in the back part of the scrotum.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with the right hand towards the inner skin of the testes: and when you do this, stretch out the white skin to the top, with the left hand: and wipe your eyes with the skin on the side of the incision: and instruct the minister to extend the eye in the opposite direction: and you should loosen the attachment that is at the back after it has been completely loosened.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And ask your fingers if there is nothing there from the intestines that are not broken down in the white skin or hard.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If there is anything there: then push it towards the lower navel.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take hold of the acme, where there is a thick thread, made from ten threads: and insert it behind the last skin, that is under the skin of the testes which follows the incision: then cut off the ends that protrude from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then make some of them into a cross-like shape: and tie them with the alsifach, about which I have spoken, because it is under the skin of the testes with a firm knot, so that it cannot send any of the blood that nourishes it to them, lest there be an ulcer.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And put another knot on top of the first one, far from it by two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two knots let go of the skin from the incision a quantity as big as a finger: and cut off all of it roundly, and remove it from there.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then dry in the lower part of the skin of the testes at the section from which runs blood and pus: as we have told in what has been preceded.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then put the wool dipped in oil and place on the navel: and administer the ligature which we have described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the sutures are taken out, apply to it a piece of white wax that we have mentioned, after incising its edge, with caution as to the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this is apt to happen many times.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And discharge the ligature, until it falls away by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if its fall is delayed, then moisten it with warm water: and place on it the piece that we have mentioned, until it falls away.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then take care of the navel with the remaining cure for the wound, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	[The Ramie plant]
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this ramage there was no one who dared to attempt a cure with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first they said that it happened as we have told about the ramage which is with the vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Which is to say that the strings should be loosed after cutting over them with ease on the lower part: and then dry in the middle, and take care afterwards for opening itself up, until they fall away: and take care of the navel, according to what we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	[The Separation Made in the Groin]
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When rupture occurred in the groin as we have told, and an opening was made, but nothing came out of the intestines: but if anything comes down to them, it is little, and goes back again every now and then: but if prolonged for any length of time, a fissure is added to the skin, until the intestines come out into the skin.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this thing happened by reason of the extension of the skin in the groin as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	Which is to say that the skin extends: and then softens, and an opening becomes apparent, and comes out.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And his cure is with a cautery, as has been preceded in his narration.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And when he is cured with iron, according to this manner: and it is so, that the sick man lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry up the place of the rupture and eminence, by section along its breadth, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tighten the ligature and, which are under the skin, until when it is detected there is a white pus, that is under the skin which follows itself.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a ray and put the patient on the place of eminence from the pus, and press the patient to the depth of the hand.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then cover the two places of eminence on the end of the ray from the pus with a stitch, connecting one to the other: then remove the end of the ray.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not injure the ligature at all, nor stretch one nor any other, as I told you to know in the cure of the intestinal branch.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then this cure for the wound.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you cut the fillet, clean it out, and restore the bone, until it is hardened.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For the stitch holds fast, and eminence of the rupture is not added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cautery is better in this place: for it is closer to salvation.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	As regards the softening of the skin of the testes, there are three methods: first, by being dipped in hot water; second, by the application of hot plasters; third, by being rubbed with a hot cloth.
Caput LXVIII.	Head XXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testes is often softened in some men, because the flesh between them becomes soft, and they acquire an attractive appearance.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked to cure himself, that he lie on his back, and that he cover the whole soft skin which has been softened over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then he will join the two lips together with a stitch: and if there is a need for it, in the first place three stitches of the softened skin, or four, and a firm stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then incision between sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then care for the cure of the remaining wounds, until they are healed, and let the sutures fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	§ On Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You should know that castration is an excommunication in our law: and for that reason it would be fitting for me to forget about it in this book of mine: and its reminder is not necessary, except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One is that it should be in the knowledge of a physician when he is questioned about it: and so that he may know how to cure him who has it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other mode is that we often have needed castration in some of our animals, for their benefits, such as rams, horses, and cats, and similar kinds of animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I therefore say that castration is done according to two modes.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by rubbing.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by a slits and cuts.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	But in that which is done by rubbing, the course of the operation is this: that we should make the animal sit in hot water, until his testicles become soft and slack, and hang down: then we should cut them off with our hands, until they are completely gone and do not appear under the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	But in castration by slit and cut, it is necessary that you hold the animal, and with your left hand press the skin of his testicles.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then bind the suspensory, and dry on all of the one cut, until when they come out two testes: then cut it after you have scalded them both, and do not leave on them any cloth of a kind of suture, which is over the skin.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this mode of castration is better than that which is done by rubbing: because by rubbing perhaps some remains of the testicles are left behind, so that the animal desires to have coitus.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	§ On the Curing of Hermaphrodites in Two Ways.
Caput LXX.	Chapter LXVII.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is from the testicles according to two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	The sperm of these is, for it seems that there is a space, or the skin of the testicles, in that it is between two testicles, figure like a small woman, in which are hairs: and sometimes when it runs urine from him who is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	But in women there is one kind, and it is a small woman over the skeleton like a testicle of a man, emerging towards the outside: of which one is like a penis of a man, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of the three kinds, two from the testes, and one from a woman, is this: for you must break down the added flesh, until you remove the impression of them.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then take care of these with the remaining wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	But as for the second kind of men, from which urine flows out, which is on the skin of the testes, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	As for the incising of the scrotum and the flesh emerging in women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The tentigon should be added strongly to the natural thing until it is satisfied and becomes ugly in appearance: and sometimes it grows great in some women, so that it spreads out like a penis, and reaches up to coitus.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	You should therefore hold the tentigon with your hand, or with a hook, and cut it off: and you must not at all go into the incision, especially in the deep root: so that blood does not flow.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of this wound with the treatment, until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	But as for the middle flesh, it is the flesh that is born in the womb of the mother, until it fills it up: and perhaps it flows out to the outside according to the resemblance of the tail: and because of this they call certain disease tailed.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	You should therefore cut it off as you cut off the tentigon, and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the Care of the Utero (womb), which is not pierced.
Caput LXXII.	De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	(The treatment of the uterus, which is not pierced, or the foramen ovale.)
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	(And it is either natural or accidental.)
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	(Accidental is from an illness that precedes it; and the same [illness] may have come about either from flesh that has been added to it, or from a fine spitting, or from a lump: and it may have taken place in the depths of the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or in its lower part; and it prohibits coitus and impregnation, and giving birth, and perhaps menstruation.)
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	(And the knowledge of it is acquired by the examination of midwives, if the accumulation is evident near at hand.)
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	(If it is not evident, then seek it with your fingers or a lamp.)
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	(If there is an accumulation of fine spittle between the two lips, then bring it closer and remove it.)
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	(And it is, as you place a handful of cotton wool on the two lips.)
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	(Then place your fingers from both hands together, and the woman should lie on her back with spread legs.)
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	(Then stretch the two lips with force, until the fine spittle is removed, and the accumulation opens up.)
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	(Then take a piece of wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the spot; and let the woman eat it every day so that the spot does not stick.)
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	(If the spittle is thick and sticky, then you must separate it with a wide leaf of mint.)
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	(If the accumulation is flesh that has been born, then suspend it with a hook and cut it: and have with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without causing pain, such as acacia and dragon's blood, and such agate with albuginous lead.)
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	(Then insert a large silver tube so that the wound does not heal quickly, hold it for several days; and administer lion's mane dried, then treat the rest with the usual treatment until it heals.)
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes when I am born from the womb, the birth of the flesh of others: it is necessary then that they be struck according to this mode: because there is no opposition with iron at all, while there is an apostema of cancerous, since there is a cancer in the womb.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athahelil, and botry rubeae in women's wombs.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter LIII. On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athahelil, and botry rubeae (bloody rash) in women's wombs.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are an opening of the venous orifices, until they bleed profusely regularly.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When then are treated these hemorrhoids, they become thori; and I have already spoken in the division of their kinds, and of their signs: and here I will speak of those which receive cure, and of those which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say, then, that the hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb, and do not appear to have any sense: then there is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But which from these hemorrhoids are in the opening of the womb above where the sense falls, they are those which are cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary then that you enter the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend Athahelil with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then dust on them near the flow of blood from one cut with a powder without mordient; as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thorns, and such like to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then push his feet against the wall at an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then put her into a cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the bleeding persiste: then let her sit in a decoction of sommach, and of corn-meal, and of gall, and such like.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take wheat flour, and make it into a paste with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	But if the blood is separated from it, then it is good: but if not, then make adhere to her back furrows, and nettle-sores, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take a piece of cloth and dip it in taraxacum juice, or in arnglosa's juice, or in the sap of the boughs of alnet trees, that is to say, in Pontic wine, and make it adhere to the leech.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When the poultice has cooled down, then take care of the place with the ointment, until it has healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth is really similar to taraxacum in shape and is rough in appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It must therefore be that you make it appear from it, according to what I have said in the illustration, equally: and take care of it, until it has healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Regarding the Output Wound That Occurs in the Uterine Cavity.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Various poultices occur in the womb, such as cancer, and hard poultices, ulcers, blisters, scabs, and frostbitten flesh, that is to say, herpes, coldness, fistulae, hemorroids, warts, and burns.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have already said concerning all these diseases and their kinds, and their signs, and their cures, in a division: it is necessary for me to speak in this book about the hot poultice that occurs in the womb, when it is from poultices that collect blood, and how to know its opening with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary, therefore, that you consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the poultice in its beginning is sharp with its percussion and flame and fever: and you see it red: if it falls on top of it, then do not like its perforation: and take care of it with that which pleases it over maturation, until such time as it has calmed down.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a chair that she can reach by two seats, and lie down, or lean back, and gather her feet toward the lower side of the femur: and let her hips be expanded, and put her arms under her knees, and bind each with a suitable ligature.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit down on the right side of the bed, and administer the instrument with which she opens the maternal womb.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form came in those who are behind.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary that when you administer this instrument, you make the womb smooth with the radius of its depth: so that it does not enter by means of the instrument more than the depth of the womb, and hurts the sick.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument is more than the depth of the womb, then it is necessary that you should put a padding on top of the depth of the womb: so that you prevent the entrance of the whole instrument into the depth of the womb: and it is necessary that you should put a turner, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and that he holds the instrument, and that he turns the turner, until the depth of the womb has opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When it therefore appears and is touched by hand, and is soft and smooth: then you should separate it from the head with a cotton wad.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When it therefore drains the pus, then you should put a cotton wad soaked in rose oil: or in viride oil, in which there is some stinginess: and you should put the cotton, and pull out a piece into the depth of the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place outside on the womb, and on the wool of the lamb dipped in water, in which there are some bubbles:
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then take care after two days with ointment that is suitable for it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes when the womb is washed and the lamb, so that it swells with water and honey: then with water in which there are some bubbles of a radix of lily, or of long aristo: and then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	That if the lamb is hidden inside the womb, then it is necessary that you should refrain from curing it with fire: indeed take care of itself with what we have said in division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Doctrines on obstetrics, how they treat the foetus according to a non-natural form of exit.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LXXVI
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to recognize the natural puerperal condition at first.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From the signs then, when you see a woman compressing herself towards her lower parts, and desiring to smell the air, and relishing herself when something is passing out of her, then you should know that this birth is in the natural form, and the exit of the child is over her head, and the second with it: or suspended, or hanging from her navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When then you see these signs, it is necessary for the womb to compress so that the child can descend quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it has passed over her head, the second passes with it, and is cleansed of its excess by a good purification.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But if this birth is outside these times, it is unnatural, unbelievable.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the child sometimes exits with his feet first, and the body goes out before her head, and his feet and hands are one, or his hand is one or his foot alone: or when her head and hands go out, or when it turns inside out, and perhaps it turns over its neck, and similar figures that are unbelievable.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is therefore necessary for the obstetrician to be prudent and careful in all these things, and to beware of error and delusion: and I will show you every form, and what is the nature of it, and interpret it by that, and point out on it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the child exits with his natural exit over her head, and it presses on her, and the birth is difficult for her, and you see its strength already weakened: then make her sit on a chair, or let the women support her: and wash her with a fennel decoction, and with wet oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the obstetrician should introduce his finger between her labia, and feel for the second inside, and wipe it with his nail, until he finds what is within her from moisture: and press the womb of the woman, until the child comes out.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	But if it has not come down, then a woman should be made to vomit with foenugraeum and oil of sesamum.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then order her to compress herself after the enema, and make her sneeze with a remedy, and hold her nose and mouth for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For a fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus come out first, then you should put them back in with ease gradually.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	But if it does not obey on entering, then put the woman on a seat, and raise her feet up: then bring the seat down to the ground: and let the woman hold, so that she does not fall by the concussion.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	But if the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then make an incision, and remove the residue of the fetus: and bind his hand with a cloth, and pull him out by equality: for he will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the fetus is on its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out on its feet, then you should push them up: then turn the fetus gradually: then make it even.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of his feet, and stretch it out gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	But when they have come out as far as the hips, then order her to compress herself, and make her sneeze with a remedy: for it will come out if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out with the narration that we mentioned, then you should gradually reduce the fetus, until you put it back in its natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For he will come out then with ease of exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	But if it is prohibited to do all that we mentioned above: then take foenugraeum and oil of sesamum, and gum arabicum: and pound it all together in a mortar with a good pounding: then mix the entire thing with the woman's urine, and insert it into her lower belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water until she becomes hypersentive.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	And so when you see that his lower parts are already warmed, then put myrrh on him and bear him.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When the wound has been held for an hour, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze: and tighten his mouth and nose: and press the lower leg with light compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fire will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	Exit the fetus on to the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it has come out in this form, then insert your hands slowly.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman will lie on her neck, and her feet will hang down to the lower parts: and she will lie on a bed, and cross her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press on her belly slowly.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then pull out what is under her feet from the pubic area, until she is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not come out, then take her feet, and move them with a rapid motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press on what is above the navel slowly, until the fetus rises to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then insert your hands, and make the fetus even slower: and instruct the woman to contract, until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	Exit the fetus hanging downward from the arms.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	The hands are tight.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	But if she cannot be reduced, then wash the woman, and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	But if walking is also impossible, then make her lie on a bed: and strike her thighs with a rapid motion.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the lubricant you have prepared from mucus.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she takes it (the lubricant), then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then study the hands for reduction, and make the fetus adopt a natural shape: and instruct the woman to sneeze, and tell her to contract herself, until she comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	Exit the fetus on to her neck, with spread arms, and her face is toward the back of her mother's body.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is fitting that the midwife should hold the fetus in her hand, and then rotate it little by little, and equitably with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When, however, it has been brought into equilibrio, then place it on the hollow of her hand that we spoke of before, covered with oil and mucus.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then command her to move it little by little.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done this, then cause her to sit down on a seat, and command her to lean to the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then command her to compress it: and cause her to sneeze with condensed air.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the fetus prepared on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descended to the opening of the mother's womb in this manner with the second touch, then cut the second touch with your nail, until it is discharged from the moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	But if he should be suspended on the surface of the fetus and its neck, then cut him from the navel: lest he should be retained, and die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus into the inside, until you put it in the right place: and command the woman to compress herself at times: for he himself shall come out by the exit easily.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or of a multitude of fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You should know that twins are often born: and sometimes three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	But this is strange, and seldom happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	But five is a thing outside nature, and do not live long: and they hold them, though they multiply, second by second: and separate them with a scissor, distinguishing between them the ligature in the navel of each one.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they go out like a single fetus going out by natural exit, easily: and they go out by a loud exit, as we have described.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	That if any of them should be difficult at the birth, and they reach that which we spoke of out of natural figures, then take care of them as we have spoken: and let her lie on a soft bed, and let her do what she does easily and slowly, and dispose herself according to every figure with him who prepares her, leading her to salvation.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	When one is formed in the womb from an embryo, and aborts: sometimes it forms one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten: but I have found that a woman when she aborts, sends out seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which is done by the glorious sage in measurement.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	This therefore needs to be in the knowledge of obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps indeed it will come to that like it: oppose therefore to him what is necessary
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LVII on the head.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you are troubled about the fetus that is dead along with what I said in the division on medication, and does not come out, and urge to use the operation by hand, then you should consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	But if the woman is of sound virtue, and is not with any of the accidents from which she fears destruction: then it is necessary that she should lie down on a bed, on her back, and should have her head turned downward, and her legs raised: and the minister should hold her by two parts, or bind her to the bed, so that her body is not taken out with the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the mouth of the womb with wet oil with mucilage of aloe, and fenugreek, and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then let the obstetrics wash her hand with these oils and mucilages: then let her enter the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she should ask where to place the hook from the fetus, and places convenient for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider therefore, then if the fetus is prepared to come down on the head: then fix the hooks in her eyes, or in her neck, or in her mouth, or in her palate, or under her beard, or in her throat, or in places convenient for that. Consider that it is necessary that the hook be fixed somewhere, so that she does not come out.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	But if the descent is over his feet, then in the chest, and over his ribs with the middle.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it should be that he holds the hook with his right hand: and he lays his left hand on himself where it is between the fingers: and he inserts it with his hand smoothly, and fastens the hook in some of those places that we said, until he has completed the incision.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then he should fasten the other hook or a third, if he is able to: so that there is an equality of contraction, and it does not decline on one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it should be extended with an equal extension, and not only a length along the straight line, but also move on all sides, so that it eases its exit: as happens when the tooth is removed during its erosion.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it should be in that place where it is between that, so that the extension softens.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	That if a part of it is retained from that, then the Midwife should put some fingers with oil: and insert them from one side, so that they turn with it what is held back.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	But if a part of the baby leaves, then the hooks should be moved to another place that is higher: do this until the whole baby has left.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	But if a hand leaves before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it due to its constriction: then it should be covered with cloth.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then remove it until all of it has left, and cut it off or at the plant, or on the bed: and so you should do in the other hand and in both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	But if the baby's head is large, or a constriction has occurred during its exit, or water has accumulated in its head: then it should be inserted between the fingers of the Spatumile spike that grows: and he should find with it, and remove the water: or he should cut it off with an instrument called Almisdac: whose shape comes with the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then he should separate the skin with pincers, just as we have said above. Afterward, he should remove the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head has come out and is held by the fork: then seek to find, until the moisture that is in the chest is discharged.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If it is not complicated and does not comply with delivery: then you should make an incision on the head suddenly, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If the lower limb is swollen or there is hydrops in it, then you should make a cut in it, until the moisture that is in it has drained.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	But if the fetus is above the feet, then its attraction is easy, and its direction to the mother's mouth is gentle.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If it is held by the windpipe or the chest, then you should remove it with the cloth that you have wrapped around your hand: and seek to find the windpipe or chest, until what is in them has drained.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If other limbs are removed, and then the head returns: then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If then the mother' s mouth is open, then the midwife should insert her hand into the depth of the uterus, and seek the head, and attract it with her fingers up to the mouth: then she should insert one hook or two hooks, and attract it with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the mother' s mouth is held back, because of the warm apoplexy that has happened to her: then it is not necessary for her to work on the head, but rather at that time it is necessary to administer an infusion of wet and greasy things: and to administer plaster: and to sit in water that softens and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is above its side, then it is possible to adjust it: then administer what we have said above about the single-foaled cow.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If it is not possible to do this, then incise hastily and remove it.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not leave anything inside at all after the second day.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we said in the aphorisms concerning the hot poultices which happen in the wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If blood should flow, then let him descend into the waters of styptic powder, and administer the remaining cure.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I have already seen a woman, in whom the fetus was dead: then she was impregnated on top of it with another viscrum, and after that another dead fetus was formed.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Then happened to her after a long time an aphorism in the navel of her, and it was swollen, until it was opened: and she began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was called to her cure, and I treated her for a long time: but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	So I placed over it some strong plasters of attraction: and she came out of the place of the opening.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then passed a few days, and came out another opening.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was therefore surprised from there, when there is no opening in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I considered, that there were bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I therefore questioned the wound, and removed many bones, with a woman who was in better condition of her health: and now she no longer lived so long a time, and sent out from the place little pus.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I do not consider this an extraordinary thing, unless there is knowledge and help for it, which the healing artist gives with his hand from the cure.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	Of Forms Of Instruments Necessary In The Extraction Of The Fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Head LXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here is the form of the Strigulator, which are made equal to the books, and to which two twists are attached to the two ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this Vertigo should be made less stiff than the strigulator: and to make it so, either of ebony, or of wood of bos.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the breadth of each of the two limbs is as broad as two fingers; and the border of each limb is as broad as a finger; and the length of each of them is a palm and a half and a half; and in the middle of the two limbs there are two additions of the same kind of wood, which have already been fixed on both, whose breadth is a half-palm and more a little; and the breadth of each is as broad as two fingers or less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions enter into the mouth of the womb, so that it opens with them when you rotate the two spirals.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	Form of the womb which is opened by the two spirals.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Other form similar to its, but thinner and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made of ebony wood, or of cherry, according to the similarity of the forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, in the extreme part of it there are two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each of these additions is as broad as a palm; and the breadth of each is as broad as two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When you open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, hanging her feet from its sides, and
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce these two additions joined together into the womb: and you holding the extreme part of the instrument between her hips.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with the forceps, equally according to the quantity which you wish from the opening of the womb's mouth, until the Obstetrix does what he wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	Form of the other spiral than that which said the ancient, as it is forced and driven the fetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	Form of the camel, from whose head comes out the great hump; and is like the forceps, which has teeth at its extreme part, as you see it.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it is made round, like the forceps in this form, as you see, which has teeth like a saw, so that it cuts and crushes.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	Form of the camel, from whose head comes out the small hump.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	Form A in the hand hold one nail.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	Form A in the hand hold two nails.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The forceps which has cutting teeth and with which the head of the fetus is pulled out.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	Form A scalpel having two ends to cut off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	Form A two scalpels also holding them in your hands.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	These instruments are all used, and the more they multiply in their species, and are prepared by the craftsman's hands, the faster they perform their work, and the higher among men because of their number.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore do not despise any of these instruments, but rather know that it is prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	It is unjustifiable, however, the need for them.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Regarding the extraction of the second part.
Caput LXXVIII.	Head 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second part is retained at birth, then you should take the weak one, so that it holds its breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then let her sneeze with conditioning: and tightly hold your hand on her nose, and the nostrils of her.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If so then she comes out through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a stick, and pierce into the cover hole: and put in it herbs opening the mouth of the mother, such as calamus, Rutum, Anetum, Chamomilla, Sesamum, Cassiam linum, and Centauroxylon: take all of these herbs, or some of them, and mix them with water, and put them on fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a arrow in the hole of the cover of the pot, and another end in the mother's mouth: and let her hold it until the vapor comes to maturity of the mother.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then let her sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	The second part will come out with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If it remains after this care, and does not come out: then instruct the midwife to dip her hand in sesame oil, or mucilaginous aloe.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then he inserted himself into her vagina, and asked her if she was the second one.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When he had found her, then he took her, and stretched her out little by little.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	But if it [the baby] is attached in the deep part of the womb, then he should insert his hand, according to what we have said above, until he finds the second one, and pulls her out little by little according to the straightness, so that the womb does not break because of a sudden pull: it should be turned over with ease towards the right and left: then add [the quantity] of the pull.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	But she obeys then, and is pulled out, and is separated from the adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	That if the opening of the womb is constricted, as we have already told: be careful with it during a sneeze, and clean the opening of the womb with herbs after the delivery.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	But if she does not come out with all that we have mentioned above, then be careful not to tire yourself out by insisting on the extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	But it is necessary that when she comes out from the opening of the womb, there are some tied around the waist of the woman.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then purify her with a tetrapharmacone ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	But this one will make her rot and dissolve after a few days, and she will come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it begins to rot, an evil smell comes out from her towards the stomach and head, and it causes a bad illness.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, it is necessary that appropriate suffumigations are administered to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	However, there are some ancient ones who have already experienced the suffumigations of mustard and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument with which the woman is suffumed while retaining the second one and during the menstruation.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made from wheat like ash or barley and placed over fire; the suffumigation should be placed on plums; hold it, until that suffumigation is consumed; and then take another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Regarding the treatment of the ano without perforation.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born, and their hams are not yet pierced, which has already been cut by the subtle sifac.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, the midwife should pierce that sifac with her finger; and if she does not, she should pierce it herself with a sharp spatemil: and let her take care not to touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then put over it wool dipped in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound with ointment, until it heals.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you suspect that it has been infected, then put a lead pipe in the hole for several days, and remove it when the boy feels like defecating.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And already the boys have become ill because of the infection from the consolidation of the wound, or the formation of pus.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore, let that consolidation be removed, and then be cured with it as we have said in the treatment with oil and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	The Treatment of Fistulas which occur in the lower parts.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter LXVIII.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	The Fistulas which occur in the lower parts are a kind of nodulation and grossness which occurs near the anus: or in a space between one part: and there is one fistula, or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	But when that nodulation is dried up, it opens, and from it runs out a watery white discharge, or a subtle pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes from these fistulas pass through them.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore the penetrating ones are known by that which comes out from defecation, and windiness, when a sick person uses it for defecation: and perhaps it comes out from them in a state of sickness.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are fistulas when they penetrate into the space up to the ischial bone, and up to the muscle of the thigh.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And there are fistulas which penetrate up to the joint of the hip, and up to a nodule at the tail end.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	But from that which is known as a penetrating fistula up to an organ, and also not a penetrating one, it is, when you put your finger of the index into an organ: and when you put in it a subtle sharp instrument made of brass or iron: provided there is no tortuosity.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is a twist in it, then insert into it trying from thin lead, or a needle from the hair, until you feel trying, or a needle in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it well, and there is no discharge, no wind, no dryness as I have said: then you will know that it is not penetrating: therefore go on to the cure.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula penetrate to dryness, or to the meatus of urine: then the meaning of it is the exit of urine from it, and its prohibition from this so that the place with medicines hardens.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	But if it penetrate to the joint of the hip, or to the mouth of the hip: then the sign of it is that it should reach trying to that place, if there is no twist in it up to the mouth: and the finding of pain on the side, and that it is discharged pus from it always: and that it does not scabs in it with ointment, and hardens.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in these all-penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all: and the cure of them is work and uselessness to it from foolish doctors, over whom a form is made.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in that which is not penetrating, and is not old, there is hope of cure with a bandage: for I tell you, and have proven it: and it is, so that the sick man lies between your hands on his back: and you cleanse the hairs of its legs all the way up to its hips, and its hips are bent towards its belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then insert-ing lead, or air, if there is a twist in the fistula, until you know where it reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	But if he feels it on a certain part, then you should put your finger-tip on the part.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	But if you feel in your finger-tip that it has already penetrated through itself on its own, by way of feeling between your finger and the skin, or flesh: then you know certainly that it is penetrating: so do not work in it, for its cure is not with it, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They said that he heals certain men of disease by means of a subtle caustic fire applied according to the width of the fistula as described above, and by introducing this fire into the fistula until it reaches a particular place.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that twice or three times until you are sure that all the added filtered flesh, which is like a feather of an owl, has dried up.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat that with liniment in butter until the flesh comes off, which has dried up: then treat it with an ointment that generates flesh and hardens it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If he is healed, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then he will never be healed with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if he emerges with the wound and does not reach as far as your finger, which is in the anus, and there is between it and the tent a thick flesh or sear: and you will see a fistula running along the surface of the skin, then dry off the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and dry out with the tent what is in the fistula until it reaches where the end of the tent has reached, and the tent comes out and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean those filtered flesh, which are like a feather of an owl, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	But if he conquers you with blood, and dissolves between you and your operation as he severs those flesh: then it is better that it should be so, and faster in healing, cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medication.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For the caustic with fire brings good habits together, it dries up the flesh added, and stops the flow of blood, and dries out the moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then treat that with liniment in butter, or powdered herbs, until the place releases puss, and the added flesh comes off in puss.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then treat that with an ointment that hardens and generates flesh, until it becomes tough: and there are medications that have stifness and drying out.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	When I am hungry, then I eat; and when I am full, then I stop eating.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula has reached the depth of the hip and has elongated beyond the confines of the body: then insert your finger into the abdomen and feel it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	But if you feel that there is a defect between you and it, and the defect is of the skin or meat, and is near penetration: then the operation on him should not be done, unless by means of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is, because it has two ways of being treated: either as you cauterize it, as we have said; or cut it off, until you get the desired result, so that you can put a hook in it, and cure from nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the cut, lest you fall on a snake that is keeping something in check, and an accident happens to the exit of the body without wanting it.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then the care for that with him which we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps he will be healed: or he will lengthen the defect, and wash it thoroughly near the hip, as we have said, or with a hook, or with another sharp instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then clean those filthy meats that are in the cut, until you can examine them.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then try to heal the wound of all the cut, and repair the hole from which the meat has come out: and there remains an open fistula in the inner part of the anus, and will be looser than the previous one.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And when this fistula follows this way: and it is when you insert your finger into the fistula: and it is in the back of the hip near the surface of the body with skin and margin of the hip: then take the sharp end of the hook-shaped thing, which is like a needle-thread, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it the string wound up into five turns, and around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert your finger with the thread into the fistula, until you get the desired result of it.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If then there is a piercing into the margin of the anus internally near by, then remove the filament from that hole: so that you can insert your finger in an anum, and remove the end of the filament, and join both ends together: and tighten each one well, and let go of it on the same day or two days: and to the extent that the filament pierces into the flesh, tighten it well until those tissues which are between the two ends of the filament fall down, and then care for the wound, until it heals and consolidates.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If, however, the orifice of the fistula is not piercing: then make it pierce wherever you prepare it for yourself, unless it be in a deep place.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it is not good for you to make it pierce because of the snake, so that you do not hit yourself with it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then make it as we have said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	Form a hook from the spine where the fistula is found, whose point is sharp and acute very much, and the other part is not acute so that it does not hit that which is unnecessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	From the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and care for wounds.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter LXIII.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids according to two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or, indeed, they are inside the anus, similar to coal or plums: or almost like grain.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And of them there are small ones and great ones: and blood flows from them always, and there is one and many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at the ends of it.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those which are outside the anus, are according to most part few of moisture, from which runs yellow water, or a little blood with a constant course: and they are according to color to that of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the cure for that which is inside the anus is, as you order to the sick person to sit down: and it is pressed until it comes out from the anus, and appears like a wart on you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore also suspend them with a hook; or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them near their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if they do not hold fast on them because of their moisture and softness: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a strip from a double-twisted rope, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and sprinkle over them after the cut some warm poultices so that they stay in place like poultices.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what has been said in the chapter on cauterizing.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with the remaining cure, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	That if the anus of excretion does not obey, then instil into the sick one a small clister, so that it moves with him who is in the anus, and obeys excretion more quickly, when it lets go with the sick one.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	But if they are extrinsically located outside the anus, then their condition is lighter, easier: and it is as if you were to hold them with your nail, or with a hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with the above-mentioned method, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And who do not like to be cut with iron, then it is necessary that you administer a suture for them in this way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a wadded thread, and insert it into the wound.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then remove the athelils to the top, and make the thread enter into its root on one side: and waddled together the two ends of the thread on the lower part of the needle, and spread them out: and tighten the athelils with a strong knot.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie a knot in the thread, and remove the wadded thread.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Make the same for all the athelils, and leave out one: and do not let it be your own flesh, so that it may flow away with an excess of blood.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then put over a certain cloth soaked in rosewater or cerate, and put the wound on it: and direct the sick person to lie down.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let go of him, until he falls.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	And when the splint has fallen off, care for them with ointment and the other cure, until they are well.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	§ On the treatment of fractures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For often accidents happen from the drying up of stool and the tightening of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they have been so long exposed to the air that there is no longer any benefit to be derived from medicine: then you should shave them with a scalpel, or with your own nail, so as to make them moist, and remove from them the upper cortex which prevents their being consolidated.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then care for them, until they are consolidated according to what is appropriate.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	But if they do not consolidate: then examine them again with a keener eye than before, until they bleed profusely, and then care for them, until they are well.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	§ On the treatment of scurvy that is caused by lack of salt and of milk, and on scurvy that is caused by flies.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter LIII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You should know that scurvy is a round nodule of the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail, and it occurs throughout the entire body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes, and causes pain when walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Then it should be cut out what is in the shape of a nail, and held with tongs or a pin, and removed from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then care for it: and if you have a cautery, care for it as was said in his chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	But of the scurvy that is caused by flies there is a small eminence, rough, filtered, round, above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And often it happens in the hands of young men.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is, that you should spread the splint, and let it fall; or that you should tie it with silk thread; or with wool, until it falls.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you have a knife, cauterize it according to what has been said above with fire, or with acute medicine: and now the splint is removed from those who are lying down, and from those who are standing with my instrument, which I call.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And the cure for it is that you take a tube from the feather of a goose or a strong wattle-bird: and you put that tube on the ant, until it holds the circle of the tube from all parts of it.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then you turn your hand with the tube, until you separate what is in the circumference of the ant: and you put it in the depth of the flesh, and you pluck the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you want to, make it with the tube of air or iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the tube sit on the edge of the limit, dragging a sound invisible, so that it alleviates the pressure of the ant and its movement.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you want to cauterize the ant according to what has been said in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	The Formicas are also instruments that are used to administer enemas for the treatment of diseases of the bird and the relief of pain and swelling.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter LIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	When the enema is made of silver, or of gold alloy, or of fine brass, or of hammered brass.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And when it is made of these small instruments, and of large ones, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	So what is administered in the cure for young children is small; and for those whose birds are weak or painful, so also are their enemas.
Clistere magnum.	A large enema.
Cistere paruum.	A small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The tube of the ant, that is, the head on which it is tied to the uterine cord, should be wide according to this form: and its edge that is bound to the uterine cord should be like that you see, and its lower end that enters into the womb should be closed, that is, not open, soft, wet, pulling towards delicacy: and there are two holes on one side of it, and a hole on the other side.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And let the width of the hole be according to the breadth of the rays, and let it be more thick or less, and let the uter be that in which they put the medicine out of the animal: or from a sheet of paper, which is according to the form of the little asphyxiated one: whose root is the palm of one hand.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And let it be pierced with many holes as it revolves, and let there be a space which is between all the hole the breadth of the finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then introduce into those holes a strong thread from raw fiber, which is made up of ten or more strands, and gather with it the uter like an asphyxiated one.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	But when this uter is put into it, let a strong knot be tied in the head between two distinguishing marks with strong compression.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then let the knot be drawn up with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the shape of the uter here depicted, and of the hole.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of the knot that is to be tied with it is this: that you fill the uter or the medicine out of the animal which is heated according to the tolerance of the nurse: and let it not be very hot or very cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then let the sick person lie on his back and raise his legs to the top: and put it under him, that is, a mattress on which men sleep, or a blanket.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then let the end of the knot be smeared with oil, or with albus from cheese, or with mucilage from fenugreek, or similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce it itself into a hole with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the assistant take both of his hands and squeeze it hard, until he has completely discharged what is in the knot into the rectum.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the knot and raise the sick person's legs against the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine makes him want to go to the bathroom, then let him hold it as long as he can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more of a last resort.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if you tie him in the solutions of the six-day illness, and hurry about his discharge: then repeat the knot, until he is cured.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or pain in the anus, then sit in a subtle bath, lazily, from the baths with which boys are bathed.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this sit in a subtle form of the bath on which is a strict skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	De curatione vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis:
Caput LXXXIIII.	Curationem vulnerum capiti, quae non sunt fractam ossibus crinis, curamus ut sub iudice iterum.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already said in the division of the cure of the wound that it was appropriate to provide treatment with a book, and I say here that we will treat these with the hand and with doctors according to a second remedy.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say, therefore, that wounds differ according to the one in which they occur, and according to the place on which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore, the wounds that are often caused are like blows of a stone; or a cut of a knife, or a blow with an arrow, or a piece of wood, or a bolt; and similar things from many other causes.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	However, wounds that are located on different parts of the body are like a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or thigh: and similar things from their members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling about the cure of some wounds, so that I set forth the reason and rule also for the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	I will begin with simple wounds on the head: because I will recall the composer's memory at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say, therefore, that:
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When it has happened in the head a simple wound, and is not a fracture of bone: consider then, if it has been from a blow of a stone, or similar, and already has broken the skin only: and is a great wound, and fear for possible painful apostemata: therefore hurry, and perform phlebotomy on the head immediately: and do not tarry with this: and draw out his blood according to the strength of its virtue: if it were not prohibiting anything from phlebotomy, especially if it were blood that comes out slowly from the wound.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the bloodletting be done from the opposite side of the wound.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick person abstain from eating too much, wine, and coarse food.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	But if moderation is required, then he should be slightly reduced from food, and not come near meat, nor wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place on the wound if it happens that he has a hot pustule, a lukewarm infusion in oil of rosewater, or with wine in which there is stinging nettle.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	But if you are safe from a hot pustule, then place on the wound if it is still fresh with its own blood, and has not been changed by air, the powder that I will describe after a little while: and if the air has already changed it, then place on the wound some unguent until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	But if the wound is large, or made by a cut of an instrument, and not gathering together by pustules, then join it with sutures, as I will describe in wounds of the leg concerning their sutures.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	But if the wound has already touched bone, and hangs down, and there is no support of it except by a small suspender: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then take care of the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh instead of skin, and order the sick person to eat food which is free from excess, such as are heads of animals, and cooked wheat, until it has become a pulse, and eat such things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	That if the wound is putrefied in the skin, and does not hold to the bone: then cut off the whole putrid part, and throw it away: then take care of that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	But if there is an artery in these wounds, or a new one from which blood flows: and does not stop by medicines, then inquire about the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	But if you do not cut the wound, then dry it with a sponge or bind it up.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	That if necessity compels you to do so, when the above is not granted, then burn it until blood stops flowing.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	But if these wounds are small and simple, then the cure of them is easy and light: so that we can sprinkle powder on them now; for they are consolidated before they change with air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The method of making incisions in a powdery form.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take a part of incense, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of non-extinguished chalk: mix all together well, and strain it; and fill it with powder, and bind it tightly so that it sticks well to the wound, and congeals with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then tie the powder on top of the wound with thread, and do not remove it until it has dried, so that it does not peel off.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine will not be eradicated from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	But when the chalk has done its work by itself, which it will do if you have no incense present, and dragon' blood also does the same operation on many large wounds, when it is laid on them and bound up, and their own blood, which has not changed with air,
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	For if it has been slightly altered by air at all, especially when it is in the summer season, then this powder's intention is not in position: so therefore cure this wound with that ointment which I have mentioned, or put on it a poultice made of wheat flour, made with water and honey, until it discharges pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the remainder of the wound with ordinary care, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	But if there is a broken bone in the jaw, and it is small, then extract it with forceps: for I will tell you about the cure of broken bones in the head.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Về các vết thương ở cổ họng.
Caput LXXXV.	Chương 75 về đầu.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	But if a wound has occurred in the throat, there is no difference between it and any other wound when the cure comes from within, and between a simple wound of the head.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	But if the incision has already been made on the nerve of the neck or artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it, unless it is cured with it so that it makes severe constriction, like ziniar and zegi and things similar to them.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	For these harm the nerves, and turn them away from their course.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not place anything cold upon a wound at all: for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuance is with the brain, which is above the members: and let this be healed by medicines with lene, as the calx is mixed with sweet water sometimes with oil or rose-oil, and also with tuthium, when it is washed away also with sweet water; and the other mineral stones, in this way, and oiled oils.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	But if the wound is large, then apply a stitch: or cover its lip with powder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of yourself, until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	But if the wound is deep, or has a pocket of pus on the lower part of it: then pierce it in a more depressed place in it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	That if the incision is on the nerve of an artery and its blood flow is followed: then separate it, or dry it up, and tie it: or cauterize it, if necessity compels to do so.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	But if the incision is on the spine and has been there a long time, and it seems that it will not heal: then join the skin together with a stitch above the sink, and do not touch the sink, but make it come back to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tighten it with a tightening that diminishes gradually, and let it alone for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then take care of yourself with ointments which relieve the itching and drying, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	But if the wound has made an impression on the bone: then examine it: then if there are any fragments of bone in it, take them all out, or as many as you can: and what is not prepared, let it alone, until the wound putsrefies, and separates itself, and grows loose.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the fracture is recent, then apply a powder over the wound that you have prepared.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	But if it is a bone that has come out and become a fistula: then treat it with what comes with the memory of its treatment in its own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	On Ulnary Bones in Spatulas.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter LIII. On the Treatment of Ulnar Bones in Spatula
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a puncture from a spear or a knife, and you can see its depth, then consider carefully.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	But if there is a discharge from the ulna, and it begins to dry up, then know that it is a fatal fracture.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep and is recent with its blood: then do not put powder on it at first, nor bind it so that the blood does not flow into its depth, and return to the heart, and cause injury: but put on a liquid ointment and loosen it by day twice.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	But if you do not have ointment with you, then put a wet cloth on the ulnar wound so that it sucks out what comes from it by moisture: and let the patient sleep on the fracture so that he does not stir up what has gathered in it.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	But if three or more days have passed since the fracture and no spasm has occurred in the limb, nor any bad tremor of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and the remaining symptoms are good: then know that the ulna is healed.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it and with care, and with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	But if the healing has been completed and it has opened up for good, then know that it has already become a fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Then care for it from its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the bone is from an incision of a sword or a knife, and it is simple on the surface of the back, or of the neck: then treat it with what preceded it from the stitch, if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if he has already made an impression on the bone and it has come out of it, then inquire about the tuberosities, and approach to remove those frusta if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	But if they are not separated, then let them be left alone until the tuberosities rot away, for the extraction of those is a relief.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	But the remains of wounds and accidents in the remaining members are a judgment in the cure, which is the judgment I have mentioned.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	[Concerning] wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestines, and the happening of those things.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption that has happened to the belly is great, middle, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From a great one, then, when and how many intestines go out,
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Why does that intrusion happen, and why the suture of those things is more painful and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small disruption also happens to be difficult from another mode.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Follows, then, that if you do not approach the intrusion of its own accord immediately to its place: for it swells up, opens up, and thickens up: why is it difficult to enter?
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	For this reason, then, a great disruption is more beneficial than a small one: for when it is not difficult to reduce the intestines, as it is in these two cases.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suture of the belly is according to four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	The two common sutures meet together in the suture of the belly, and in the suture of the remaining parts of the wound; and the other two peculiar sutures communicate with each other to the rest of the wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, there are more proper when it is the suture of the belly: and I tell you one at a time with explanation and description.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say, that when the bone is small, and something comes out of it from the intestines, and it is difficult to reduce it: then it is because of one or both of these two ways.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said: or because there is inflation in the intestines because of cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore that is so, then it is necessary that you should warm him, so as to submerge the sponge, or a wet cloth in warm water.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or you shall boil him in water with squinants, and cypress, and pepper, and bruise it with the entrails, until the swelling be resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When therefore that wine in which is stipticitas: and it is better than water alone in the resolution of inflammation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see that inflammation be already resolved, then wet the entrails with water in which has been boiled the above-mentioned, or sour them.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For by this the entrance shall be soothed with the medicine.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If however there be a return of the disease after this cure, then find in breaking up a little, with an instrument wherewith the hemorrhoids are torn.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when it is prepared, than the cutting: and there is no necessity to force at the second operation, nor want of instruments.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of him which is bent, acute, and the other part which is not acute, and the extremities are a little less acute than the middle, and let it be somewhat like the knur, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When therefore the wound is enlarged, and the entrails are drawn in, then it is necessary that there be a retrenchment of them after their own nature, in their own place, if it may be done over that: for it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When therefore the rupture is wide in the lower part of the thigh: then it is necessary that you should lie the sick person on his back, and raise his legs with his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it be in the upper part of the thigh, then let his head and his breast be higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And likewise if the rupture be in one side of the thigh only, then let your intention and your attention always be upon this, that part which is hurt be higher on one side than on the other.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it should be, that you may apply to the wound, both great and small.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But in small wounds, place it according to how you have prepared it.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make it present between your hands the faithful server who shall hold all the incision with his hand, and add the lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then detect from it he who follows, something to suture after something: and this is the manner of common suturing one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, so that you take it up, or number it up according to the quantity of width of wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let go from the extreme of incision quantity of finger ring, that is, measure: and fix now one than you put into it in two extremities skin, with two extremities siroc which is under skin from inside, until you make it penetrate from other side, and you have already added two extremities skin, and two extremities siroc: and there are four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tighten with double thread around the acuse from both parts at the same time, until two lips of wound have been added by descent aggregation.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let go roughness of finger and also fix in them other than: then make it straight with thread, as you did with the first one.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Not therefore cease to do it with him whom you carry from the acube, until you complete constriction of wound all.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let there be acuse middle between roughness and thinness: for the acuse that are thin very quickly cut flesh: and gross are difficult entry into skin: therefore it is necessary that they be middle in thinness, and in roughness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary, that the acuse be fixed in two extremities skin near: so that flesh does not quickly cut, and wound opens before its consolidation, and also do not lengthen with suture, so that wound is not prevented from consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut off the end of acuses, so that they do not hurt patient at his sleep: and put feathers from all sides, which hold extremities of acuses: and let go them, until you know that wound is already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this type of stitch with needles is indeed more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Since one, or two, or a certain number of needles are sufficient to sew them up.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	But the second common stitch is to bring together the ends of four layers: the ends of two skin layers and the ends of two fat layers in one line, with a needle in which the thread is equal in thickness and subtlety, and
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then, when you pierce with the needle these four ends, bring them together from the part from which you began, so that the thread is stretched from the upper part of the wound: so that the stitch will be like a stitch in a piece of cloth when it is sewn, and place between each stitch the amount of thickness of the little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This type of stitch is known by men.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this stitch I sewed up a wound in the man's abdomen, which had been cut with a knife, and the injury was about a palm wide: and about two palms of intestinal tissue came out from the middle intestine, and the damage was in the center of his groin.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	Then I reduced it after he had stood for twenty-two hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	So the wound healed in a space that had been for about fifteen days: and I nursed him, and he recovered: and after that he lived for many years, living in his own affairs.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors judged that he would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle that I healed him with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Since I was in a place where the ointment was not available, and there were no medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	Then I laid a cotton swab wet with balm on the wound twice a day, and I bathed it with honey water until it healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will mention two kinds of stitches according to the account of the speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, as you begin with the acute stitch: and introduce the needle from the outside to the inside part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle then enters the skin and goes according to the length and width of the whole body: release one end of the sifac to the side where you inserted the needle, and let the other end be pulled through from the inside to the outside at the other end.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	But when you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this in the same extreme end mirach from the external part to the internal: and dismiss the extreme end sifac, which is in this side, and make it penetrate now in the other extreme end from the internal part to the external: and make it penetrate with your penetration, which you do make it penetrate in the sifac extreme end mirach, which is in its part, until it penetrates into itself all.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then also from this same side, and with the same end, take it out of the skin where it has penetrated: and now take out what has penetrated with your hand.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then reduce it again into that skin, and with the same end take the sifac extreme, which is in the other side, with this mirach end: and take out of that skin what is from its part, and make that one move, and the other not: and make that one move after the other, until they are all outside according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the top of this stitch is so that its stitch joins the skin together: so that its one end comes out from one part of the skin: and that you dismiss its other end from the other part, until it is completed.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	Second kind of stitch, which Galen named.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This speech was told as if their stitch was similar to that of certain physicians who make them come together in a way that is appropriate to nature: and they apply the sifac end to one end of it, and the mirach end to the other end of it.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this one does as I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you make it penetrate now in the mirach end which is near you from the external part, and make it penetrate into it on its own: and dismiss the two ends of the sifac.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn it around now, and make it penetrate from the external part to the internal in both ends of the sifac, that is, on each side.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn it around both of them, and also make penetrate both of them from the internal to the external, in two ends of the mirach which are on the other side:
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of縫 is better than the common one that is easy to make and is the sutura whose predecessor was remembered.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore also the speech of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And said someone:
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The sutura of the hand is corrected with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, so that you enter them both with one thread: and begin with the insertion of the needle, on account of that which is with you, and let it penetrate as far as the other side, according to the sutura of their bones which are equal.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you shall know that when the rupture is in the middle of the hand: then the sutura of it is more difficult than that of the other places of the hand.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the medicine of the wound, is the judgment of the other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, because when you make a fresh wound with its blood, before it is altered by air: and reduce the intestines, and their own substance, and make them fit: then put on the dust of the incisions.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	That is, if the air has already altered the wound: then put on the wound a certain ointment which is present with you, until it makes the pus: and let the threads fall away, and be hardened by the sinew, and be cured.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then that care which I have described is like the care of the other wounds, until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If, however, you do not have at hand the medicine which I have described, then put on the wound as soon as it begins to emit pus, and keep changing it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you would not have need of other medicine in many dispositions, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If, however, you are in a place where the wound communicates with the principal members of the body in the injury, then you should dip the wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil: and put it on the places which are between the hips, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	That is, if it feels pain, or twitches, or has putrefaction in its intestines (for this often happens) then you shall use the laxative medicine with wine which is black and warm: especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestines, and there is pus penetrating as far as the root.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And you should know that what is from the large intestine is easier to heal; and what is from them is subtle, harder to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	But the intestine which is called the jejunum does not receive healing from the wound which has occurred in it at all; and that is because of its multitude, being from veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the nearness of its nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	But if that which proceeds from the wound is scanty, and you make it few: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if, on the other hand, there has been a space left for it, and it has already become dark, or black: then you should bind it with thread above the place which has become discolored, so that blood does not flow.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in them are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligature, and put two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside the intestine: so as to alleviate its attraction for you, and its extraction at the edge of the dark, and the emission of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remembering the wound which happened in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When there has been a rupture in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible, that it should be restored in some men; because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with the thrust of a lance, and it was a wound on the right side of his stomach, and it was old wound: and it made a fistula, and discharged entrails, and had wind.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	So I applied treatment, until I was not confident in his healing; and I did not persist in examining him, until he had healed, and the site had consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place now consolidated, I was afraid of disease, that might happen to him in his belly: and it did not happen to him from that accident.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in the best of his dispositions, eating and drinking, and enjoying himself, and entering a bath, and exercising in his diet.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And already some experimenters had said, for when it happens in the intestino a ulnus, and is small: then it should be bound according to this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And is, that you take the ants of great heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then gather two lips of the wound, and put one ant of these which have an open mouth on two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	And when this head is over her, and strings his mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres, and does not unbind itself.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then put another ant near the first one, and you do not cease to make it with the ant after the quantity of the wound of all this.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce him, and his wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	That head remaining annexed in the intestino, until it feeds on the intestino, and heals, and does not happen to cause a deep wound of harm.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is possible that the intestino is bound also with a fine thread: which is taken away from the intestino animal, annexed with it as soon as it enters into the acum.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And is, that you take the end of this thread out of the intestino, and much flesh is cut off.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then bind on the end of this thread with a fine wrapped thread.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then introduce that thread into the acum, and follow it with the intestino.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce him in a disruption.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this way of sewing with ants and intestines is not but second to the first one of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know that the wound which is great and broad, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then is not but a subtle art, nor is its healing at all complete.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Of the care of Zuzechim, and Fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Head LXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know that every wound, or old bruise when it has healed and dried up, and turns into a sore, and does not close up, and always discharges pus, and does not heal: then is called universally in any member whatever, and we call this same thing Zuzechim.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula is indeed the nodulation of a filtered, hard, white wound; when there is no pain, but there are tender, delicate ears; and for that reason some call it a risa, that is, an ear.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in certain hours humid, which discharges pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps it splits into two in certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And when this humidity is much, and there is little: and it is thick, and it is fine.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already prejudged in the division, then when I said wounds, that every wound which does not heal, and does not grow in it flesh, is not that unless for a new cause of diseases.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is because there is little blood in the body; or because of a malice of it; or because between itself and over its lips there is hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh; or because it is very dirty and full of filth; or because the wound is putrid inside, and the matter it sends out is of bad quality; or because the medicine is incompatible in its cure; or because corruption falling into the region is a kind of pestilence, or because by virtue of the region, as happened in Caesar Augusta: for in that place it is difficult to digest ailments, and the healing is slow of boils by nature; or because there is only one opening, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all the causes and signs of these wounds, and the cures of them with physicians in a division: and it is necessary here that I should tell you the cure of the Fistula and the Zieken, which is done by the way of an operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore that a fistula happens in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For these are the fistulas which penetrate into large veins and arteries, or nerves, or intestines, or rectum, or any of the spinal bones, or any of the joints of the body by composition: such as hands, and feet: and from those arise fistulas which pierce into the proximity of the principal member, and the like.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	What is said here about these fistulas is that from this point of view they are difficult to cure, and do not respond to treatment, and the occupation with them is work and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If, however, there is any fistula the depth of which does not reach these places that I have mentioned: and you hope and trust in its healing, and examine it with care, then accept a trial from brass or iron, if the fistula tends to straightness, and investigate it along with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If, however, there is any fistula that has tortuosity, then investigate it with a thin lead wand.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	For lead gently alleviates the pain of its own body, and deals with tortuosity.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	Since if the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate on it with a lead wand.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	So examine the openings from the openings themselves.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For because of the moisture that clisterizes itself, it turns towards other openings, and runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then inquire carefully about how it is possible for you to recognize: so that you can know whether there is an opening or a nerve, and the fistula runs far away or near: or there is one fistula whose openings are many, and it stands over all of it, with your greatest care: with your questioning, which you ask about the sick, and the discovery of pain when pressing with your hand on the place, and similar indications and causal accidents apostemated.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then stand with a true station while you are doing all this: then move towards healing in accordance with confidence: and is, when you consider then, if it is a nearby fistula that appears, or in a place far away from the joint, or from a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places that I mentioned to you: then dry up the fistula according to what has been premised in my narration, and remove whatever is in it from filtration, and corrupted meats, which is born in the opening of it from flesh, or the sinew, and similar things: and heal it, until it is healed.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	But if the fistula is of great depth and straight: then it is necessary to separate it as much as you can in the depth.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then clean it completely of all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply the poultice of liniment infused with acute medicines: and insert it as far as the fistula you have contained with iron: do this several times, until the acute medicine has completely corroded what remained in the fistula's concavity from the corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with unguent that generates healthy flesh, until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	But if it does not heal through this, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	But if the cause of the fistula is an opening, and it is confirmed by you that it is: then examine the opening, and stop up the opening according to what I have told you: if it does not prohibit from any of new tissue, or nerve, or principal member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	But if an opening is detected by you, and there is in it some corruption, and blackness: then shave it, until the whole corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the flesh with that which generates flesh, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	That if it does not heal, and it discharges pus as it used to: then know that you have not achieved the total eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Then detect on it again after the second day, and examine whether it can be shaved, and clean it with your last strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	But if it heals, that is good: and if not, then know that that corruption is in a remote depth of the body, which you have not achieved.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	It is therefore not in your power to do this, unless you leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	But if the corruption is in a small opening, and it is possible for you, attract it with subtle forceps which are appropriate for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	But if there are many bones: then examine whether you can attract them all, and do not let go of any of them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If, however, you find a resistance from the humidities and there is no fear or mistake in incising them, then incise those humidities and flesh, if there is any, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If, however, you are not prepared to remove the bones at your own hour, then place over the limb that it may rot itself: and leave it, until it has rotted what is in the surroundings of its bones from the flesh and humidities.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the limb so that it does not consolidate.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And constrict the section which you followed in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Then place over the limb, if you wish, drowned in sulfur twice with oil: or once drowned in Egyptian ointment, or some other ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those humidities putrify, and the bones separate from them, the removal of them is eased, and their attraction is removed.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	But if there is one large bone, such as a femur, or a pelvis, and that which is corrupted from it is a large part, then shave the limb with the last razor, until the corruption and blackness are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the limb.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	But if what is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw the limb, and incise it all the way to the point where the corruption reaches: then care for the limb, until it has consolidated.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I will tell you the story of a man who suffered on his leg: so that it may be an example and help for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	He was a young man of about thirty years of age, to whom pain came in his leg, from some matter moving within the body, that is, from the inside, until it reached the limb, and there was an ulcer great enough. And there was no external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	So he stayed with that error of the doctors for a long time, until the ulcer opened, and many substances entered with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And after that, his cure is to be delayed until his hand is healed, and many openings are made in it; all of which discharge pus and body moisture.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	So he was treated by a number of doctors for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of his hand until I came; then I saw his hand and the matter that was coming out of those openings with great flow: also all his body was gangrened, and his color had turned yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	So I inserted my hand into one of the openings, and it came to the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I scrutinized all the openings, and I found them all coming together on one side of his hand.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	Then I removed, and I followed one of those openings, until I found the bone part: and I found it corroded: which was already rotten, and decayed, and pierced, until it penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	So I cut off what I had detected, and I prepared it from corroded bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I removed, for there was nothing left in the bone but that corruption, which I cut off and sharpened.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And so I had removed it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I placed a patch of dry wound with long-consolidated medicine.
Et non est consolidatum.	But it was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried again, and I found on top of the bone a second time: and I found a continuous corruption with the bone, and I sharpened what seemed to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	But it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Then I detected again on top of the bone, and I did not cease to strike the bone little by little, and to try to restore it: and it was not restored until I struck out of the bone near the palm, and I took it out with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicine, and it was quickly consolidated, and healed; and this iteration in its operation, and cutting, was not necessary unless for the weakness of the nurse, and her lack of tolerance, and my fear of it from death: for it happened to him at all times from a bad syncope of discharge.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	The patient is therefore completely healed: and the new bone has grown in place, and his body has been made sound, and his strength has returned; and he has recovered in his powers: and he has recovered in his dispositions: and he has not done him any harm in walking at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	But if the jaw is broken in a place in the body where it has already been broken: then it should be fixed, in this way: that you take a ligament, and tie it tightly at the end of the bone; and command someone who will stretch it upwards: and put another ligament, from a coarse wool, after the first one.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind the bone over the flesh, which is between the bones: and extend its end so that you can pull the flesh down towards the bottom: and you cover the flesh over the place where you want to fix it, so as not to hurt the flesh when you cut it.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a piece of wood or a board under the bone below: because when you do that, the flesh is not hurt, if you don't cut it.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it should be fixed over the corrupted place a little, so that there is no concern about the bone's corruption; and it does not appear in its appearance to the sense, and compels his own fixing force by means of another ligature.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	Which if the bone is corrupted and is not prominent, but continues with a part of it: and corruption is in its middle, or in one of its parts: then you cover all the flesh from all the parts.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place a piece of wood below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then fix that from the first part where there is corruption, until it continues with a fixing force from the other part: and let the fixing force be a little longer according to what we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	Which if corruption is in a joint, then cut that joint which is corrupted, and fix the bone where it continues from the other part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	But if corruption is in the continuation of two joints: then there is no power there except for a cut.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	Which if corruption is in the hand's palm, or in the foot's sole: then the matter is difficult and hard.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter apareat tibi.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And after that, you should cut off the part and clean it up in whatever way is possible for you and adjust it with the right tool: when it does not create a contrary vein or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And you should know that there are many chisels and saws to cut these bones, according to the arrangement of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and subtlety, and size, and smoothness, and hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, you should prepare the right tool for every type of surgery that suits that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations require a long study with the instrument you are holding when performing them.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of these methods of the art is a witness to the methods of diseases: for then you will already find out through yourself what suits him from tools for any disease.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am confirming to you at the end of this chapter the number of tools, which are given as examples of what to cut, and a proof of what you have experienced on other things.
Forma Serrae.	The shape of the saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of a different saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This shape of the saw is drawn, but not very accurately made.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let the bow of his back be made from steel: and his handle from birch, and his shape a little off-center.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The shape of the rasp is joined.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this rasp be in the form of a star-shaped claw: and its points be in the form of star-shaped dots.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it does not suit unless you rub it with the heads of rasps when they are worn out, or a wide and large mouth, and is great.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The shape of a larger rasp.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The shape of a medium rasp.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The shape of a broad rasp.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The shape of a raspberry that is closed up.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Form of a sharp razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Form of the curved end of a sharp razor.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	Form of a thin, sharp razor blade.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Form of a razor used to cut bones.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Form of a large, sharp razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a file, and the end is like an axe: it is shown in many places in the dissection of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	Form of a razor that fits close to its cut which has been made through bone.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	The end of it is triangular, and its ends are acute.
Fit ex Indi.	Fit from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And likewise it should be, that all which we have said of razors, and of chisels, and of saws, may be.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Of the incisions on the ends, and of the fitting of the bones with saws.
Caput LXXXIX.	Head LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The ends putrifie, either by an external cause, or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	But when you have cured it with medicine, and there is no cure; and you see corruption coming to a limb, where it does not affect anything: then you should cut that limb all the way to where the corruption comes in, so that the sick one may be cured of his malady which is greater than the defect of the limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign of what happens to that is, that the limb becomes discolored, until it is cured: for if fire burns it, or putrefaction comes after corruption: until corruption enters into that which follows that limb, and spreads through all the body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Then it is proper to cut the limb with care, and in like manner if the cause of corruption is from an external impact from some of the venenous ones: such as the sea scorpion, the bee, the nettle, and others similar to them.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	But if corruption or an impact is on the end of a finger, then cut that finger, and do not leave space for corruption, so that it may go all the way to the other hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And likewise if it has happened in the hand, then cut that hand from the root of a sharp axe, and do not leave space for corruption, until it reaches the length of a short arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if you have penetrated into it, then cut the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if corruption has already taken hold, and you see it all around the elbow: then death is upon that limb.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And apart from this cure, a certain amount of strength is required.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And likewise do for the foot, when corruption has penetrated into a toe, then cut it at the joint: and if it enters the shin, then cut the whole leg.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	But if it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	That if corruption has already reached above the knee, there is no hope of recovery, except for amputation and surrender to death by leaving it to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the way to cut the limb off, or to sever it is, when you want to tighten the ligaments lower down, which you want to cut: and tighten another ligament above the spot.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And stretch out one minister's ligament downward: and stretch out another minister's ligament upward.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments with your spatulum, until all the bone is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then cut it, or sever it.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And you should place a linen cloth over all parts, so that the saw does not touch the sound bone: and it happens to the sick with added poultice and warm plasters.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	But if blood flows inward while you are working, then cauterize the spot quickly: or put some powder on it to stop the flow of blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your own medication, until it is finished.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable ligament, and take care of it, until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I will tell you what happened to the man in his foot, this same thing that I am telling you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because it happened in his black foot, with the heat that is like the burning of fire: and that corruption first began in a toe, until it covered the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore the surgeon took a knife from its case, after he saw corruption come upon the member with its movement, which he found out from pain and its warmth; and he cut it himself at the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, that same corruption happened to him again in his index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	Then he came to me, and I tried to restore that excess with him when I put on his hand from the medicines after purifying his body: and the excess did not respond, and it began to heal in another finger: until the corruption began in his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	So he called me to cut his hand: but I did not want to do so, hoping from myself for a response to that excess: and I was also afraid of death at the cutting of his hand by incision.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For the power of the finger was above death.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	And after he had despaired of me, he turned back to his land: and he came to me about it, because he hoped, and he cut off all his hand: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not bring this account except to be an aid against that which falls from the kind of this disease: and to be a sign what signifies, and according to what is concerned.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	On the treatment of gangrenous wounds, and the quality of cauterization with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 100.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When a gangrene happens in some fleshy member, and the space of the gangrene is prolonged, until it does collect blood: then it breaks, or pierces, and what is in it comes out, and there remains a hollow place like a wound, and the skin over it is like thin cloth: and it does not come to its last corruption, nor impresses into the bone, nor the nerves, nor the ligaments: it deserves to be called a Sinus: but it is not called a Fistula: nevertheless if it prolongs its space, until it impresses the corruption in some of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or a zak-o-kain.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the cure is such that you strike off all of the skin like a wrapper; and above all when it has become thin, and made like a blanket; and put trust in it because it would not adhere to the place, for its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you hope that the skin will adhere, and does not result from it that corruption: and if there is a thickness of flesh, then the cure itself with Cantharis: and is, as you consider to the sinew.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is great, and the pus that is discharged from it is foul-smelling: then cantharis itself with a medicinal substance, which is vinegar, oil, and saffron, parts receiving equal portions, mixed together in a vessel: and boiled on fire, until it turns red: and comes to a thickness of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and cantharis with it to the sinew: and tighten the opening of it, and let the medicine into it for a period of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with an expression: make it for days, until the sinew is cleared away, and the smell is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when cantharis is made with water of ash, when this medicine is not present with you: and is, that you take ash from wood of oak, or ash from oak-tree: and pour it on water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then strain it, and cantharis with it, until you put trust in that the sinew is now washed away.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	That if the tolerance for the Egyptian medicine is not strong, nor for water of ash, then cantharis itself with water and honey, which has already been mixed with crushed saffron.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or cantharis itself with honey and wine, mixed, for the property of honey is to purify, and to wash away: and wine makes the sinew adhere, especially when there is an abundance of astringency and dryness in it.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	How often do you perform this operation and trust that the sinus is now healed: then clean him out with a syringe as he performs the operation to give birth to flesh in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And so that you may receive the embalming paste: and dissolve him with rose oil, and with wine astringent: or clean him out with certain medicines, and with other ointments, whose properties I have written in the book of ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	That if the opening of the sinus is narrow, in which the syringe does not enter: then widen it slightly with a bit of iron: or put in it licorice soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it widens.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And likewise if the opening is also wide, then join the lips together with a stitch: and let go from it a quantity in which the syringe enters without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And likewise if the opening from which there runs pus is elevated towards the top: then dry it out in a lower place that is in it so that the pus runs down from it: for when pus is confined in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being born in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	That if you are not able to dry out the sinus all around its lower part according to what you wish: then try to prepare the member in such a way that the pus runs from it easily according to how you prepare it for yourself.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Consider that you do not retain anything of the pus at all in it: and take medicines that are used to put on the spot, fitting for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And have such a quantity of the cloth so that it communicates with all of the sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps into the direct opening of the sinus hole, making a slightly larger opening of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend from the ointment a thin cloth over another cloth according to the quantity of the hole: and place it on the member at a distant position from the opening of the sinus so that the exit of pus from it is aided: and do not remove the large cloth, unless after a few days.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	And yet he who is super orificium sinus, is he whom you move at all times, so that he goes out what is gathered in him from pus: and know ye, that the virus which runs out of it, is much, or little: or digested, or indigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And when ye consider again the place of the sinus itself, do ye not see that the lord feels pain in it, or is there no pain in it? and is there an apostema or not?
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your treatment extends thus far, and ye see the matter which runs out on the orifice of the sinus, then know that the sinus is already attached, or approaches to attachment: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or in the third day: and when ye dissolve the wound, then change the cloth, and renew the unguent.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if the virus runs out of the sinus after a long space of time, then do not despair concerning its attachment, because its healing approaches, since there are persons who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and from them come those who act in the opposite way.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if it runs out after many days of putrid matter, then know that the sinus does not attach.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	But if the attachment of the sinus is prolonged and its matter is dried up: then let physicians add to it in their medicine so that they make it moist in its substance, and in its virtue dry: as the unguent of daphno, when added thereto an excess of addition out of myrrh.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the greatest last which is cured, is it that ye take the unguent of daphno, and dissolve it with rose-oil, and it runs over on the old sinuses equalling its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then bind the unguent to the sinus, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And this same action is similar when ye have not present to you the unguent of daphno, but ye have with you honey, when ye boil it up, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Take myrrh and aloe and olive oil; and let them all be crushed together, and put that powder on honey as it comes out of the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then spread a sheet over the wound, and tie it tightly around the sinus; and spread the powder on the wound, and put it on the sheet, and tie it tightly.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when the long arhatolgia is administered to it, and the roots of the star lily, and there is a lily; and flour from grass, and daisy.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them simple, or crushed, spread it out, and the powder itself: and put that honey which you have made, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the sinus does not heal with this treatment, then you shall know that there is corruption in its depths: or it has already made an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or on the ligaments: then treat the sinus with fistular cure, according to what has been stated.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Of the cure of paronychia and of the grinding of the nail, and of the incision of the finger added, and of the section.
Caput XCI.	Chapter XCI.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Paronychia is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb or any other finger, and perhaps it arises in the other fingers too.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When it is prolonged and neglected, and left without treatment, and becomes an abscess with a hot poultice: or itrotts and discharges pus, until it corrodes the nail root: and perhaps it corrupts all of it, and perhaps the corruption reaches the mouth, until it gives off a foul odor: and makes the end of the finger swollen, and its color is black.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When you then treat the sinus with what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not bring about a cure: then you must cut off all the excess that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after it.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For the cautery is very hot.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	But if the mouth is sound, and the nail also is sound, and the additions of the nail are already pressing inwards the flesh towards its interior, and they begin to sting it, and hurt it: then you must place a very fine radium under the angle of the nail that hurts the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut into the flesh easily, and put on top of it what remains of the flesh from burning medicines, from corrosions, until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then that care with ointment, until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If however the corruption has already sunk deep into the palate, then one should break open that palate and take it out: for it is never healed while the corrupted palate remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see corrosion and corruption entering into the finger, then cut it at one of its joints, according to the above-mentioned reminder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for that wound, until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If however there is an injury from scraping or striking: and there is sharp pain, then one should let the blood of that person first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail with a sharp spatula, cutting across from above to the wound.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And guard it, so that the cut does not go down into the flesh below the nail, for you will cause to happen through it a very painful pain in the sick one, and it will be a cause of the birth of flesh added in place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for that place with what sits and has pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The finger however that is added which is born in some hands of men, perhaps is flesh all over: and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it: and the birth of some of their joints, or is born in some of their joints.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	So this which is born in some joints of the finger does not move: and this which is born at the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore that flesh from which it is easy to cut, their section is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, so that you break open it at its root with a spatula of a flat edge.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But the care of that which is born in the root of a joint, is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore abstain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In that finger however which is born at the last joint, then one should break open its first flesh all the way to the mouth.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then close the mouth with one of those sharp things that are convenient for closing it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then the cure of himself, until he is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	The consolidations that happen to the fingers together, often happens or from birth of man, that is, he is born with it, or from the consolidation of the wound, or from burning fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, it should be that you separate that consolidation, until the fingers regrow their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them a piece of linen, or rags soaked in rose water: so that they do not come together quickly, and separate them: or place between them a thin lead plate, until the site consolidates as needed.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And likewise, if the consolidation of some fingers with the palm, then dry that consolidation, according to which it is prepared and suitable for the member's form.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	De incisione:
Caput XCII.	Chapter LII on the head:
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Veins that are swollen, large, and filled with melancholic superfluities which occur in many parts of the body: and most of them are found in the legs, especially in the thighs of those who move about a lot, work hard, or carry heavy loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, it should be that you administer the body with a strong dose of black choleric, sometimes through vigorous perspiration.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then take blood from the patient in a sitting position.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The cure of those veins with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One is, so that they sit and black blood is drawn from them.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is, so that the vein is ligated, and all of it is extracted.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The sectioning of this is according to this method:
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Wrap the leg first with hot water, until the thick, putrid blood is resolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then tighten the leg of the patient from the upper part of the hip to the lower part of the knee with thread, using the rope.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then dry the vein at one place, or two, or three wide sections.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then draw blood from the lower part of the leg to the upper, and from the upper should it be drawn by the phlebotomist first while the patient is still standing.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut off the nail down to the bottom: until it has run out of blood as much as you see is sufficient, and as much as strength endures.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then bandage it up: and tell him to refrain from foods that cause black chill: and again drainage and bloodletting when the veins are filled, and this hurts the sick person.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	But his elevation is according to this mode.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the wound, if there are many hairs in it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then introduce himself into a bath: or wet himself in his own leg with warm water, until he turns red, and the veins swell: or exercise himself strongly, if there is no bath present, until he warms the limb.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin in the direct section of the vein along its length: or at the end of it by the knee, or in the lower part of it by the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with a hook, and scrape the vein from all parts, until you can feel it: and it is at the appearance of it that you see it turn red from white by its decline.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When then you remove it from the skin, you see it white as a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce under it Radium, until it comes out and exits the skin: suspend it with a blind hook, gentle.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry another section next to that section by three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein, until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then apply Radium to it as you did, and suspend it with another hook as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry another section, or more sections, if you can endure it.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then apply Radium, and cut her last section at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then take it out to the section that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this, until you take it out from the upper section: or longer sections, until you have taken it all out: then cut her.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	But if he does not obey you in having it extracted and washed, then put a strong thread twice around it and tie it up and extract it: or insert under it radium: and withdraw your hand from all sides until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And be careful so that it does not injure itself.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it injures itself, it will be difficult for you to wash it well, and it will get into the illness from it.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	So when you have extracted it all: then put on the wound wool dipped in wine and oil with a scent or oil: and take care of the wound, until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	That if the vine is contracted, it has a curvature where there is an innovation to its parts, and it is not like what we said according to the straightness: then you must find on it for all the parts of its curvature, and the places of its innovation.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then hang it up with a hook until you have washed it all: and be careful by your section on it so that you do not injure yourself or hurt yourself, for it will be difficult over you to wash it well or to extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Preserve therefore your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The Shape of the wound when the vine heals.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The shape of the hook.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not a curvature like the rest of the vine, and there is no acute extremity, so as not to injure a hand: and it has gross flexibility, soft: for if it were subtle, it would hurt a hand with its subtlety: but it has superfluous grossness, as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter LIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is born in the legs in warm lands, such as that of the horse and of the Arabs, and in dry, hot lands, scant of grass, that is to say, in those where no草 grows, nor trees.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is born in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And this generation is indeed from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, as they occur within the bodies of snakes and worms of the ascaroidea, and worms that are generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this venereal disease is a severe inflammation of the thigh.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place becomes swollen and painful.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to come out of the place of its swelling, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When then it appears from this extremities, then you shall bind the same with a screw of lead, whose weight is a drachm of brass, to two drachms and mark it: and then take off the lead that is hung on the thigh.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever then it goes out from this anything to the outside, bind the same in lead and mark the same.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	That if it is prolonged for a long time, then he will cut off a part of it, and bind the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And you shall not cut it off its root before it goes out all.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you shall cut it off, then it will contract, and enter into flesh: and it makes happen a blister, and putrefaction in the place, and a bad wound.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it shall be that it is suavly handled, and taken out gradually, until it goes out from its last end, and remains nothing of it in the body: and from this very vein go out in some men, who is in length of his five palms and ten fingers.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And then he came to me, for he went out by a penis that was twenty palms long.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if you shall be cut on you in the hour of your medication: then you shall introduce a rod into its opening, and pierce it through a long way with the body, until all that is in it is discharged out of the same matter: and you shall administer putrefaction of the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then take care of him in the cure of the blister.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein has branches in many places, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself; and many openings happen to it, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Take care therefore of itself, as we have said in the division, and with what precedes.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	[On] Section on worms that are born under the skin, and it is called "Illness of the cattle.
Caput XCIIII.	Head [108].
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This sickness is called in some country among us "Illness of the cattle": because it often happens to the cattle and is a pale flesh, which is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it leaves the whole body, going up and down: and is perceived by the sense in walking with its limb from one member to another, until it breaks off where it has broken off in the skin, and goes out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the decay of some humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As worms and snakes happen, that is, earthworms, and roundworms in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And are afraid of its evil.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it leaves the body and rises to the head and comes to a place: then perhaps it opens in it, and goes out, and destroys the eye: and this happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	But when you are to treat it, and to remove it, then it is not done by the sense of touch or sight.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	It must be, that you should tie what is above it, and what is under it with a strong cord.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry off on top of it, and remove it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it has sunk into the flesh, and not hurt itself: then put over the place a cauldron with fire, until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And greater than this, which is feared, is its decay, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	But if you see it having already come to the head near the eye, then tie under it a good tight cord.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry upon the flesh, and pull it out.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is fitting that the sick one should use his own purification of his body with medicines that dissolve the bad putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	[De] Section [i.e., cutting] on disease [the part] of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter LXXV.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This disease is called in our tongue Nakir, and it is a pain that occurs in some part; then it changes from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And indeed I have already seen him, according as I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a sick woman in some wounds.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she laid her arm on me; and I saw an inflammation of the lung in the broncia [i.e., windpipe].
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I had left for an hour, I saw one inflammation running with fire as it ran down from her shoulder; and it went up to her arm more rapidly than she could run: so that it was like silver in motion when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	So the pain then disappeared from that part, and remained fixed in her shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then after I had left for an hour, it ran into the rest of the body until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he told me that it was pulsing all over his body; for I saw it.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was therefore astonished at the speed of its change from one member to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed I had not seen this disease with my eyes before it ran in this way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I saw many who found the disease to change from one member to another: and I did not see it with my eyes as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that this was because she is from those who are from dried-up wounds of the skin; therefore, it follows that this changeability of motion seems to be due to wind.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that those who are not affected by this should not appear in this way in those who are languid and have moist bodies; hidden wounds.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When then you shall take the cure of his eye, and he shall feel that pain: if it appear to thee in his eye, as we said, then thou shalt bind it above him, and under him likewise quickly: and dry it above him, till he go out that windiness: and causticate the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	But if you do not see the eye with your eyes: then cure that eye with the removal of the body, and with it the windiness that it expels, and with carminative pills made from foul-smelling plants, and with pills made from serax and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	[On the Extraction of Arrowheads].
Caput XCVI.	CHAPTER LXXVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows differ according to their species, and according to the places in which they are lodged in the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Of these there is a variety, for some have large points, and some small; and some are conched, and some are flattened.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And of these there is one which has three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And of these are tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And of these are arrows.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those however which lodge in the limbs, fall according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For the limbs are conched from those principal members, such as the brain, and the heart, and the liver, and the lung, and the kidneys, and the intestines, and the urinary bladder, and those like them.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When then it falls into one of these limbs, and you see the signs of death, which I will tell you about later, then you must extract the arrow from among them, for death follows it in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	But when those bad signs are not apparent to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the limb, then draw it out, and mend the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For when the signs occur in the brain when an arrow falls into it, and pierces the bone, and comes out above the brain, there occur from it: for there is a violent jaundice, and stuttering, and giddiness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and cramp in the tongue, and convulsions, and confusion of thought, and forgetfulness.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood will flow from the nostrils, or from the ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and the ox is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And moisture that is like white pus may flow from the wound's site.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And it shall issue therefrom a substance similar to meat soupy in consistency.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If these signs appear to you, then refrain from cure, and draw out the arrow if it has not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart are these: that is near the left nipple: and it feels as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in a soft thing.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow has a movement similar to that of a pulse: and black blood flows from the neck.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And follows this chill in the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	So you see that death has come without a doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	The sign of the arrow when it wounds the lung is the flow of foamy blood from the neck; and the veins that follow the spine are pale, and their color changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out great, deep breaths; and seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow falls into a rib cage which is in the breast: then it is near the back ribs: and it causes a great longing with a throbbing pain, with a sigh: and all the limbs of the arms move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps it flows out from the neck with some uneaten food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls into the stomach and becomes stuck there: it flows out from the neck some stool, or dung, or a torn intestine which has already been ruptured.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is therefore no hope of curing it, nor of drawing out the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow falls into the bladder and flows out urine: and proceeds from it something to the outside, and the pain is stronger on the sick person: then you know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remains of the limb, such as the face, neck, throat, spatula, aid, dorsal spondylarthroses, furcula, hip, thigh, and shin bones, and similar bones from the limb are preserved according to various dispositions: when the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve; and it is not a penetrating arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I will tell you that I saw such arrows exist, as you indicate by that one about your curing.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is, because a certain man had an arrow hit his eye's tear duct, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	So I removed it from him on the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I drew out another arrow from the Jew, which had hit him in the fat of his eye under his lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I could not get it out except for its far end, which held to its own wood; and it was a big arrow of Turkish arrows, with a soft iron point, where there are no flanges.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	So the Jew was healed, and no harm came to his eye with that accident.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I drew out another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabic arrow, and that one has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	So I followed it with two guides between the two; and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	So subtle was I with it, that I drew it out: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I drew out another arrow from the belly of a man who had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After that had passed over him thirty days, and there was no change in his disposition from what I had seen before the arrow; so I followed the arrow up, and I managed it, and drew it out: and he was healed, and no harm came to him with that accident.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	I saw a man who had an arrow shoot through his back, and there was a bone that had become firm over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	Afterwards, then, having elapsed seven years, the arrow was drawn out from the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman who had an arrow shoot through her belly, and there was a bone that had become firm over it, and the arrow remained within her: and there was no change in any of her natural dispositions, and she did not find any harm in any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man, who had an arrow shoot through his face: and there was a bone that had become firm, and remained, not finding much pain therein: and there were many others like this.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I took the arrow out of the king's sons from the middle of his nose, and it had already begun to decline towards the right side a little: and the whole arrow was hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	So I was called to treat him after the arrow was shot out until three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found the arrow's shaft very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	So I examined it carefully, and could not feel it: but he himself felt a prick and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I hoped that was where the prick came from.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	So I applied plaster to the spot with the adhesive and digestive power, confiding to him that it would dry up the place, and let me know the sign of the arrow, so that I might break over it: but nothing happened in that place indicating that the arrow had followed its course.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	So I applied the plaster to him for several days: and nothing happened, and the bone had become firm while: he remained weak with respect to taking it out of space for a certain day, so that he felt an arrow shoot through his nose on a certain day.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me about that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	So I put acute medicine on that bone for several days, until it healed open: and when I tried to move him, I felt the arrow's slight prick sticking to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added, through the acute medicine, to the opening of the wound until we could see the end of the arrow; and passed about four months with it.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then, after the swelling had increased, and it seemed possible to me to introduce my fingers into it and move them, and it did not comply with exit; then I did not cease to be delicate, and devise means for it with engineering devices, until one day I managed to do it with a kind of crooked hooks, according to which the shape of them came at the end of the chapter, so I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the fracture.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And the doctors are saying that the cartilage of the nose has not been restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	So I restored it, and the fracture was consolidated, and the health returned to its complete health: nor did he suffer from anything at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I will tell you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: that you put that rule and meaning on it which I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For the parts of this art and their distinctions are not understood by narration: nor does it understand that book, and the craftsman compares little to much: and when something is absent, he finds a new operation, and a new instrument for the descent of external things of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I will say then, that arrows do not come out of the body in which they are fixed, except by two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by attraction from the place into which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the reverse of another part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which comes out from where it entered, or is an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and is attracted, and comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	That if it does not comply with exit within the hour in which it falls: then you must leave it for a few days, until it putrifies the flesh which is around it: and its attraction will be relieved, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And also if it is lodged in a bone, and does not comply with you to exit: then leave it for a few days: and again bring it out with attraction and movement every day, until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If he does not obey you until after a few days, then it is necessary that you cut off the whole skull with a thin saw, until the sutures are increased.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract him and remove him.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	But if the arrow is fixed in the skull bone and has already entered one of the ventilations of the brain, and it appears that there is something of the accidents which I mentioned: then refrain from attracting the arrow, and let go of it until it is equal to being after a few days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the top, then death does not prolong itself for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	But if the arrow has not penetrated far and remains only in the bone without reaching the top, and the sick person remains so for a few days and nothing of those accidents happens to him: then use your cunning in attracting the arrow and removing it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	But if it is fixed firmly, and does not obey you in the attraction: then apply a thin saw around the arrow, as I told you: then take care of the place, until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	But if the arrow is already hidden and concealed in the body, and hidden from sense: then seek it out with effort.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel it, then attract it with some instruments that are suitable for attracting it.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	But if you cannot reach it because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow in the depth, and there is no bone or nerve or blood there: then find it out, until the vein increases, and it becomes possible to remove the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	That if they are ears which hold it fast from all parts, with any device that you can: and use your cunning if it cannot be freed by the movement of the flesh in the breaking of the ears, and their twisting, until it is satisfied.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And you, when you administer the extraction of the arrow, in whichever part it is, then use the twisting of your hands with tweezers to all parts, until you make it satisfied: and the last subtility, so that the arrow does not break, and it becomes difficult for you to attract it, and its extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot bind it in a single hour, then release it after some days, until what is around it putsrefies.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then apply the poultice again: for indeed bandages do harm if there is a contrary flux of blood, then administer what we said in its own chapter: and guard your virtue from the incision of the vein, or nerve, or chord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer ointment in every way that is possible to you of the Sarmentum: and let it be with facility, and tranquility, or slowness, and firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that, when you draw the Arrow, you make it so that the infirm person is according to the figure, according to what was in the case of the Arrow in itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For it is more a matter of judgment.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	But if this is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	But the Arrow which comes from the opposite part, or which has already gone out a little towards the outside: or which makes the extreme end of the Arrow to protrude by sensation from the upper part of the skin near it, and see that it is emerging: so cut it off above, and let the section be according to the quantity which enters into it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then attract it: for indeed it is easy to come out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	But if it is held in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness, until the Arrow presses into the bone, and expands itself: then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: release it for some days: and then apply it again, until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the wood of the Arrow is in it, then push it with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	But if it has fallen, and you are to administer a push: then introduce the tool that is sharp, so that its sharpness enters into the tail of the Arrow: and then push it with that.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	But if the Arrow is closed, then push it with the instrument entering into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	And the arrow is healed by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	For if the arrow is poisoned, then you should cut away all the meat in which there is poison, and if it is possible for you to get that.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of him with that which suits him concerning that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	That if the arrow is falling in the breast, or in the belly, or in the vesicle, or in the loin: and it is close to you that you touch with your hand, and it is possible for you to cut over it: then cut, and carefully from the incision of the flesh, or of the nerve, and pull it out.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then bend the arm, if you see it, and take care of that, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form Of Forcings, with which Arrows are pulled out.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Behold that they are similar to the tips of arrows, made like iron: when they grasp it over the Arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And they are of many kinds, great and small, and medium, according to the quantity of the size of the Arrow, and the smallness of the wound, and the constriction of it.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	Form of the Impeller Here is a description of the form of the impeller: It has four pieces of metal, like blades, joined to each other; and the blade that is nearest to the arrow is broader at one end and narrows towards the other.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the form of the Impeller is dull.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is like the ends of a radii, that the entrance into the arrow may be facilitated, and driven in with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	This end of the impeller is conved like a feather of an arrow: that the entrance into the Arrow may be facilitated, and its driving with it.

¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	This is Albucasis' discussion of vein extraction.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	But the extraction of veins, according to Albucasis' method, is dangerous: because it tends towards the drinking of alcohol, and corruption of the gingiva; and sores that are bad, as well as cracks of the lips, and sores that are bad also, even those that are in the nose, and around its circumference.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	And the quality of vein extraction is that it keeps the sick person from sitting before you: and tighten his neck with a noose.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	Then turn the patient's lip and look at two veins: the one is on the right side of the lip, and the second is on the left: and the indication of both is by the color of amber.

Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Then cut each one of them as it falls.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	But if you have any hesitation about yourself, and you don't know which is which: then proceed to the incision of the larger veins, and make them more manifest.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.

¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	This is Albucasis' discussion of vein extraction under the tongue after the phlebotomy of the head.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	But the two veins that are under the tongue have a dangerous phlebotomy: because the phlebotomy of the head is for the pre-focations that are in the throat, and the sickness of the mouth, and the sickness of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And what is the quality of phlebotomy, so that the sick person sits between your hands before the sun: and anoint his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side, and on the other side: and the color of both decline to blackness.

¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Of three veins on the bed.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The veins, of which there are three that are phlebotomized in the bed, are in which the custom of phlebotomy runs in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And phlebotomy is done from them according to two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Or piercing with the phlebotome on one side: or anointing to the subtility of the decline: or drying with the phlebotomizer and it is Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	So Alnesil is, which is suitable for the section.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from them are species wide, and subtle according to the width of the veins and the form of the phlebotomizer with a blade, as you see it.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening closed veins, full, coming from, appearing, thick, and those that contain gross, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotomist is of lesser width, and more subtle in the extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of subtile veins, which contain citriny blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Of the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	But the Basilica, which is a single vein of the three veins that are phlebotomized, is the iuuamentum.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from the ailments that are under the throat and neck, from this it follows that it goes into the chest and belly: and it is suitable for the phlebotomist to phlebotomize her, so that he does not fear, and sit on the edge of [the] fear from her, since under her is the artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If he should mistake and add a needle to the puncturing of the vein, he would cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore, he should not add a needle when puncturing with the phlebotome: let him stand apart with Anesiacum.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the Basilica does not appear with a clear manifestation, then you should remove it and replace it with another one, or seek out one of its branches: or you can place the phlebotome at the site of the bursa of the elbow.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For this is manifest, and dry it with Anesiacum phlebotome, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	But if you want to make a phlebotomy on the same arm, then you should do it before the elbow joint, so that you can find the place of pulsation.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the spot with caustic powder, then wrap the arm, and dry up the vein with a needle, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And let it not fall by chance into the space of the artery's place.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see that it is swollen at the place where you have marked with caustic powder, then this swelling is the swelling of the artery: so remove it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see blood rise at the site of phlebotomy, like a boy's urine, and it is pale blood, then know that it comes from the artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	So then put your hand on the spot for a long time, and then take away your hand.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If then blood is separated (for it is often separated) let the arm be held still, and let go of that part: and guard against its movement: and let it rest on fear for it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move that part for a few days, until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the blood does not separate and hurts you: and there is no medicine present for your moment, then cut the artery if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities are bruised, and blood is separated.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	And take hold of the fascicle of skin and find it out; and take hold of a half, and bind it tightly over the place of the wound that is descending with the ligament and down to another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then take care of himself with what remains of the reminder from the place of the flow of blood that has been cut off: and the cutting off of his blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small wound place, and the possibility of the ligament out of the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	Of the phlebotomy of the skin of the pig.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	But the venose of the pig is a phlebotomy that draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower body: because it is composed of the branch of Basilica and the branch of Cephalica, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it fits the phlebotome so that he is afraid of his phlebotomy, because there is a nerve under it.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	But if he adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy and finds the nerve, it happens in her stupor, and difficult is its cure, and perhaps does not cure thoroughly.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve appears many times to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But if it is hidden in some people and is subtle, and does not show itself: then you must put your phlebotomy so that he finds the phlebotomist, and a section with Alnesil, and far from the nerves with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	That if the pig is between two nerves, then find a pig in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Of the pig of the head.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	But the phlebotomy of the pig of the head is a phlebotomy because it draws blood from the head, and brings to the ailments of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it must be in this pig proper, if you want, so that you phlebotomy it piercing with the phlebotomist oileum, or with the phlebotomist Myrtle: for it is healthier of all the pigs, because there is no artery under it, nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	Indeed, it is fitting that you should go to the phlebotomist's shop, for he will only tie a knot on your head, and you should inquire about a gentler place: and it does not hurt him if it is not discovered with a first punch, so that it may be renewed several times with phlebotomy.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	Indeed, perhaps you should cauterize certain people when they are not phlebotomized in the first punch, but it does not hurt him that cauterization in some way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	On the Usefulness of Phlebotomy and the Observation of Cauterization in It.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The Qualities and Complications of Phlebotomy and What You Should Consider in Their Correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First, therefore, of these things you need to know, that phlebotomy is administered not unless for the preservation of health, and perseverance in it, and caution against the advent of sicknesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And so phlebotomy is done in one of three positions which are in a bed, namely: the cephalica, and the fusca, and the basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And so phlebotomy is done at the beginning of spring on a fast, and in summer: and in autumn, and winter after feasting, when there are indications of fullness.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And so phlebotomy should be done on the first or third day after having passed three hours from a meal.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	But phlebotomy that is administered in sicknesses has not a determined time: but when it provokes conveniently and necessity to it, in the night, or in the day, and at all times, and at all times.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not necessary that boys should be phlebotomized until they are fourteen years old.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be phlebotomized before the fourth month and after the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should seniors who have already passed sixty years be phlebotomized.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	But when anyone is to be phlebotomized however it may be: it is necessary that he should purge his bowels before phlebotomy with a soft laxative, if there is much waste matter retained in them: so that the blood shall not attract the skin of the limbs from the bowels by its putridity.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Do not let the patient bleed too much, that is, do not cause nausea; and do not let him sweat from drunkenness until he has removed it from himself.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Do not let the sick person have a water-based fever.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let phlebotomy be repeated after diarrhea, vomiting, flux of blood, increase in copulation, toil, exercise, vigils, fasting, and any other thing that dissolves virtue from the physical body or animal substance.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider with care before doing this, if the blood is thick with food and drink and medicine: if it can be done to him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let him bathe in lukewarm water, if he does not object to it for anything: or let him exercise himself in some kind of exercise, that his blood may be softened.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And put phlebotomy to him in his chest, about the third day as we have said: and be careful that his chest be empty of all animal evil that day: such as anger, fear, and worry: and all bodily evils, such as toil, punishment, overindulgence, and such like.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him make his own things present with him when he is in his own country, so that he may have the use of what is customary to humans from aromatic substances, and smells, and delights, and similar things by quantity of possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the phlebotomist sit on a table, which shall be higher than the phlebotomy table: then shall he take his arm out, and rub it with his own hand twice, or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then let him tie a ligature with the cord, and twist it round two turns.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be tight, because a constriction is not equal when it is too much or by excess of constriction, then it prevents the flow of blood: or in relaxation, then also it prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the constriction, let the phlebotomist rub his hands together back to front, until the blood rises and feels good to the touch.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist removes the blood with little oil, of his own making.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he places his index finger of his left hand on the venation at the place where he plans to make a phlebotomy, little by little: so that the blood does not flow away, and the vessel is not injured by the pricking.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For from the venations there flows blood as does a string when phlebotomy is performed: and from them there comes blood of good flow: and when you place the phlebotome on it, it is pressed by the phlebotome, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and does not open the vein: and if he opens it, it is tight; therefore, so that the phlebotomist may be firm and alert in all these things,
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	then let him place the phlebotome.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If then one vein opens from one drop of blood, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat the same drops a few times under that place or above it with some haste: if not, then find another place.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	That if it is not pricked, or if it grows weak, then let him leave it for a day or two: and do not tighten the ligature.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps indeed does attract the cold apostema.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	And let no bath be made.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then let him repeat the phlebotomy if he likes it.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	That if the opening is small, or blood flows slowly: and let him time so that not a drop of blood goes out of the amount that you wish: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same place according to the straightness, and add to the procedure a little bit.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do this with some haste, before that place is pricked: for indeed that place is pricked in many people during the procedure if it is small.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If then you see the person already pricked, then do not repeat the phlebotomy on that place at all: for indeed it is no excuse with you to make a mistake.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place on the venation some of the soft oil: for it will ease the course of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than oil itself, and than the rest of the oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And likewise administer the oil of the earth in all your phlebotomies, wherever you do phlebotomy with the prohibition of the course of blood; and make that which is called Tyrocum (Toryon) and sagzene (sagxe), when it is put from one of them on the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For the blood is thinned and resolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	That if it should happen in the place of phlebotomy a great aposteme, for many times it happens, especially to him who is not phlebotomized except at that time, or is a small opening of the vein, then immediately put over the place a sponge infused with water and salt, heated slightly: and tie it one hour: for it is resolved.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you should do that which is called a tyrocum  (Toryon) after the exit of blood from the vein itself with its complement, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	That if it remains in the place after a certain time of blackening, or of verdigris, it does not hurt that which is called a tyrocum   (Toryon); and if it is a vein, put over it some oil, or dissolved myrrh: or some juice of mint, that is, of calamus or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And many times happen apostemes and eminences at phlebotomy in the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Then put your hand over it, then if it is soft to touch under your pressure on it, then that eminence is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Care therefore, that you put over it some of that which we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood flows from that vein.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a patch with it where there is a stenosis, so that the place may be hardened.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the hand itself with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that you should give to every man out of his own blood according to the quantity of his virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And that which appears from the bright color on top of the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	If the blood is black, then let him leave it until it turns red: and if he sees it is thick, then let him leave it until it thins out: and if he sees it is sharp, then let him wait until its sharpness goes away.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And he who is full, strong, and resistant to the extraction of blood, let him draw it once, so that the phlebotomy of the vein may be increased, and let the phlebotomist stand on his left side: and in regard to him who is weak, let him stand on the opposite side.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And let him draw the blood from the veins, and let there be a tight opening; and it is better that what is administered in the phlebotomy of the vein should be a transverse section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of phlebotomy is healthier and safer than the incising of the nerve: and it is more praiseworthy and healthier than phlebotomy by way of width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And he who is accustomed to fainting during phlebotomy, let him eat a little bit of bread soaked in grape juice before phlebotomy with moderate heating: or secani-bin, if he is warm: and let there be extracted from his blood in three veins, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if he has a cold complexions, then let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in honey syrup, or in honey syrup seasoned with spices, or in syrup seasoned with an aromatic smell.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	That if it should happen that a syncopation occurs during phlebotomy, and there is a cause of his blood's exit: then let him drink in a bowl water of flesh, and syrup of the subtle aromatic: and let him use the aromatic with the algaria, and let him spread his chest while doing so: and let him use the rest which we have said in the distribution in the chapter on syncopes from the extraction.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	But he who wants to recover his arm, and to let his blood flow a second time: it is necessary for him who has had phlebotomy because of excessive extraction, and whose power is weak, that he should let his blood flow little by little according to the strength in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Whoever wishes to set his broken arm in place, and to stop the flow of blood by means of second application, and the body is strong; then he should do so after seven hours, or nine from the time of the first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite part to which he leans: it is necessary that he should do this on the second day or the third.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body there is much blood already heated and sharpened, and which causes fever: it is necessary that he should be taken out of it a certain quantity of blood, and that so much blood be drawn from him as will increase the opening until syncope occurs; after you have preserved all the conditions of phlebotomy; and in order that you may put your hand upon his pulse at the place where the blood flows, so that death by syncope does not occur.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For many times it happens that the phlebotomist does not know and falls through carelessness.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not when you wish to set the arm in place, and to stop the flow of blood by means of a second application, that the orifice of the vein is already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, so that it presses upon him with vehemence, and turns quickly inward.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is a bad wound, deeply let go, until he is phlebotomized for the second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or move it with keenness of phlebotomy that which is coagulated from blood at the orifice of the vein, and put upon him a certain amount of dissolved salt in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place upon him some of the tar-water or the sagden, and place the body with gentle compression until blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If, however, the vein is already blistered, then let go of it, and do not press it, until it returns to its normal state.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	That if necessity compels to stop the flow of blood by means of a second application, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize him above that place, or in another arm into another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	But the vein of the arm is opened at the place of the fustuce and the basilica, when they are not found and are hidden, because it is made of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of its opening, that the sick person puts his hand in hot water, until it turns red, and the new one appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it is bound over it with a little tightening of the ligament.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then the bloodletting is done according to the direction of the veins, not according to their length, and the opening is wide, and your bloodletting is done over the bandage of the hand a little bit.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the blood flow is prevented, then take the hand again into hot water, and let the blood run into the water, until you have the need to stop it.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if you were in the days of summer, then you are excused from the repetition of putting the hand into hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed the course of blood in hot water is long during the cold season.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the bloodletting of this vein is healthier for all veins, because it is not a pulsating vein, nor is there a nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	But bloodletting on the right hand of the patient confers health on the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of its opening is that you squeeze the hand with a little ligament, or your hand, after you have put it into hot water, until the new one bends, and is clearly felt to be sore.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then the bloodletting is done by crossing it.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, it will not hurt that thing at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And keep your hand away from bloodletting.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For under it are the nerves of the fingers denuded of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then take the hand again to hot water, and let the blood run in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not repeat it in hot water, the blood will coagulate at the opening of the vein, and the flow will be prevented.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	So when you have extracted a certain quantity of blood from necessity, then put oil and salt on it so that it does not harden faster.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And in the same way, you should do with all broken limbs.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The instrument for phlebotomy from the left hand is this: since it is related to splenitis: and likewise do with its phlebotomy, as you did with the second one equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The instrument for phlebotomy of the veins is for ailments that are in the lower part of the body, such as ailments of the uterus, and retention of menstruation, and ailments of the kidneys, and old sores of the hips and thighs, and similar ailments from illnesses.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is that it should put the sick foot into hot water: and make friction on it until the blood flows, and tie above the knot with a thong.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the place of the blood is at the heel, visible towards the thumb: and many branches come out of it towards the foot's face.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Phlebotomy should therefore do with a larger branch of it, or at its heel in the cluster: since it is better and healthier.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	That if you phlebotomize it in the foot's face, then be careful of the nerves that are under it on the foot's face.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy so as not to hit it: and let the phlebotomist be silent.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If blood flow is prohibited, then turn the foot of him into hot water: and let the blood run into it, until it flows.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	That if there is a mistake in the phlebotomizer in the first cut, then let it remain with phlebotomy towards the top for a while, since the place is healthy, and do not fear harm from it, when you are tapping the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And likewise with the other limb equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	But the location of the sciatic vein, as we have said, is at the heel from the side of the pine tree.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the treatment of varicose veins is to relieve pain due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of phlebotomy is that it should be done with warm water and dried off; and his leg should be bound up tightly from the hip to the heel for four hands, with a long thin strip: for indeed it does not appear except for this reason.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it does appear, then do the phlebotomy as well as you can according to your ability or turn; and it is better either to cut it off with a scalpel or to separate it by section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For the place of it is salutary, and itself is hidden to many people greatly.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If indeed you do not feel it at all: then phlebotomize some of its branches, and that which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ear: and cut away from the nerves, and cause it to run with a quantity of blood as much as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then حلصه ہڈھ کے علاوۓ سے، اور اس میں ویسھ کھڑیں گے اور اس پر گھڑاں کرگے گے.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	جیدھ بھی آپ ہڈھ کو راحتی دے گے گے.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	وہ بات ہے کہ: "بھلوتومی کی سِتھ بھلوتومیا کا استعمال کرنا اور ان کی کیفیت".
Caput XCVIII.	(کاپيت ۈڵٹو)
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	ان سے بات میری جاتے ہیں: "بھلوتومیا کا استعمال گھڑیں اور نازک جانے سے ہوتا ہے".
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	وہ بات ہے کہ یہ دو तरह سے کرا جاتا ہے: "بھلوتومی کی ایک وڈیوں سے ہڈھ میں پڑکنے اور دوچھ رہنا".
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	یہ بات ہے کہ ہم دو بات کا بھلوتومی کی وڈیوں سے کرتے ہیں: "بھلوتومی میں نکالنا اور خون چھوکتا".
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this Ventosis which is without scarification, is according to two modes.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or indeed it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the Ventosis which are administered with scarification and extraction of blood are fourteen places of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of these there is one, Ventosis of the noble, and it is last of the head: and Alkehel, and it is middle of the neck: and the Ventosis of the Al-Hadhdahim, and they are two folds of the neck from both sides simultaneously: and the Ventosis of the mind, and it is under the jaw in the lower mouth: and the Ventosis of the two spatulas: and the Ventosis of the Achhos on the end of the tail: and the Ventosis of the two flames, and they are middle of the two arms: and the Ventosis of the two knees: and the Ventosis of the two cheeks.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed Ventosis does not extract blood from you from small sparse veins in the flesh, and because of it the power does not fall from them, such as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	And it is not necessary that Ventosis be administered with fire or without fire in any illness that occurs from fullness, until the whole body is emptied.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	That if necessity compels to Ventosis from illness, or because of custom, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at its end, and at its middle, and at any other time.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	That is, because there is a person who, when blood multiplies within him, until it needs to be extracted by Ventosis, finds in his head a headache and dizziness.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And among them is one who finds fullness and redness of face in his head, neck, and throat.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And among them is one who finds itching in his face, forehead, darkness, and dullness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And among them is one who scrapes the place of his Ventosis.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And among them is one whose laugh multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And from these he has derived the taste of blood in his mouth: or let him lick his tongue, and let him spit out the blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And from these his sleep increases.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And from these his vision is increased while he sleeps; and he sees blood and redness, and those who are slain, and plaags, and things like them.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When then shall we see anything from these, and especially if it be in the third month: let us then put on the wind, after they have passed over two or three hours of the day.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	But the sign of Wind-panting is this: for it adds to the heaviness in the head, and that which is breathed forth goes into the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it is necessary that that be after the evacuation of all the body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this Wind is called Phleborrhagia cephalica.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it should not be used by one who has a cold complexione, or in whom there is a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it infers great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And for this reason it should not be used by the elderly, and in whom there are diseases of the head due to cold.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But whoever uses this will fall into oblivion.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And for this reason you should order the Wind-panter to put his hand down slightly towards the bottom, fearing the generation of oblivion.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Wind-panter or Alchehol is called Phlebotomy of the Face, and phleboomy of the nose, and for this reason it adds smegma, constricts the windpipe, and makes fissures in the instrument of wind, and coughs, and fills up.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it should be driven out by Wind-panter slightly, for if it is put down lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Wind-panter is called Alchadhihim, it brings about pain to the accidents in the head, and to the eyes, and to the headaches, and to the perforations, and to the pain in the roots of the teeth; and it is the phlebotomy of the nose.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	It is fitting that you should refrain from cutting with the scissor [i.e., with a scalpel] before the wound has closed: so that it does not strike an artery and cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	But if there is a wound in the mouth, let him put alcohol in it and wash away the inflammation of the gums and similar ailments that are in the mouth; and let him stay where there is phlegm [i.e., a fluid] in the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	But if there is a wound with pus, let him go to the alchemist [i.e., an physician or surgeon], who makes it [the wound] well and cold.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	But if the wound is inside the body, let him use three scissors  [i.e., scalpels] of different sizes: the Basilica, the Fusca, and the Cephalica; for these draw blood from all the small veins that are in the flesh, and those small veins draw blood from the larger veins until the drawing reaches the three main veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is fitting that you should warn Ventosator not to cut too much: for the place is naked of flesh, and there are nerves and arteries underneath.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	But if a wound is ventsated on top of the anus, let it be applied to hemorrhoids and ulcers below.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is fitting that you should warn Ventosator not to make the wound too small, and not to use iron  [as a cutting implement]: for the place does not like strong suction, and perhaps the fine scalpels will break  [if applied too strongly]: and cut with a big cut.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	But the fine scalpels diminish little by little    [the wound]: for they draw blood from all the body, and cause old pains in the kidneys, and membranes, and vesicles: they provoke menses, and bring forth both urines, and wind; and stay where there is phlegm of the two saphenous veins and the alhorcobene.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, it weakens the body greatly, and causes fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	The joint of the hock is close to the joint of the two hind legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the hock is that you should place the foot in the first place without a grip, and wet with moderate suction: and do not prolong the position of the foot, but put it quickly and move it quickly so that the fluids come to the spot from all sides: and do not stop doing this and continue, until you see the spot already red and swollen, and it appears red with blood: then therefore cut, and repeat the suction slowly.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the arrangement of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For one who is of tender flesh and rare pores, it should be that you cut once only, not more: so that the spot does not ulcerate.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And order the hocker to amplify the incision and make it deep: and moderate the suction in ease, and quickly, and with a swaying motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	That if there is gloom in the blood, then you should cut the spot twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In a single blow the first incision opens the way for subtlety of blood, and makes it runny: and in the second blow of the perscrution of the subtle extraction of gross blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is very foul, then let the incision be made in a single blow: so that the last result is obtained.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And to the end, when we want to extract blood slowly, slightly, or at all, one incision is enough for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	That if we want multiple extractions of blood, let us make multiple incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we are measuring, that blood is thick: then it should be that the incision is deep: and the equal end of the incision is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is this that should be administered from oils in the arrangement of the hocks, and what does it caution the hocker?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that which the skin is thick, tough, dark, and whose pores are tight, it should be that the places of the hocks are anointed with open, gentle, and soft oils: if it is in the time of summer, such as is aleurites oil, or violet oil, or almond oil, or sesame seed oil.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	If it is in the season of winter, then then oil of Narcissus, or oil of Lily, or oil of Camomile, or Sarbatic oil: and to these similar ones.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	But if there is a gross superfluity, then cold oil: then amaranthine oil, or oil of Balsam, or white oil, or oil of Anise: and to these similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	But if it is a wind-ridden case of widespread diarrhea with tender meat, then one should be prevented from the oil, and these places should be cleaned with water rosated, or cold water, or water of sole, or water of cucurbits, or water of portulaca: and similar to them.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	But the one whose blood is of many humors should clean the wind-ridden cases with vinegar, or water of Myrtle, and Sumach: and similar to them.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	But if there is a gross superfluity, he should clean his wind-ridden cases with old wine, or with water of Samsou, or with a decoction of Anet, or of Camomile: and similar to them.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it should be prevented that the diarrhea occurs in a bath, or in a washing-place; but it should be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not appropriate for anyone to sleep after the diarrhea.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is needed so that the wind-ridden one is cured, or the phlebotomized one before the diarrhea?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that, you should consider in the first place: then if it is a wind-ridden one, or a phlebotomized one, whether there is an acuteness and inflammation in his blood: then he should take something to cool him down, such as granatum muscat; also with vinegar and lettuce, and secaniabin, and juleb: and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And put away from him his spicy foods, and any meat that causes asecation, and cooked foods with berries: and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	If his complexions are cold, he should take syrup made from honey, or from almond milk, or alsecania, made from seed; and wine with a strong odor, which is between new and old; and it should be prescribed that he eat a little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And put on his food feathers, and birds, that is, many pigeons; and let him eat pigeon-feathers.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it should be that the drink of bloodletting and phlebotomy is more than food; and it should be given in a drink to some men at the hour of the tarragon, or a remedy with musk, that is, muscatel, or alsecaine before bloodletting: and before phlebotomy, or after: so that the principal members are comforted, and the blood is made subtile.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it should not be that they take it in a hot drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	On Bloodletting Without Scarring.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	But those bloodletting that are without scarring are those that are laid on the liver, and the spleen, and the bladder, and the navel, and places of the testicles, and the stomach-ach: because these members do not suffer scarring on themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not sought through them, except by an attack of blood from one member to another: such as we put the Bloodletting on the breasts in the sickness of the flow of blood to the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them, that we may relieve a member from cold bloodletting that is in a member: such as we put the Bloodletting on the stomach, and the navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For herself tightens the member, and heats it, and takes away pain because she has resolved the bloodletting.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	Also is laid on the kidneys when there occurs in them urine or stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For by virtue of its own attraction it may perhaps open the urine, or rid the place of a stone: for it can open the urine, or remove the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And also when it is laid on the liver, and the spleen next to cold bloodletting that it takes in them: for itself does not take bloodletting from them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these wounds are dealt with gently with only a cut.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are treated with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are treated with warm water in pleural diseases: and that is, so that the Ventosa is filled, and it is large, with only warm water, or with water in which herbs have been boiled that are suitable.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of the treatment of Ventosa with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its opening be that of two fingers wide, according to which we form it: and the quantity of it in depth be half an inch: and let it be in the side of it at the place which is round about its middle, a small hole, according to the quantity that is put into it: let it be made of brass, or copper, gross margin, soft, equal, and third: so as not to wound the member at its position over it: and let there be in the midst of it a rod running through it of brass, or iron, whereon a candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And this kind of treatment is great, greater than we described before, and there is a little less one for diseases and ages.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For the wound of boys, and those who are weak, and different from that of men, and of big bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	But the quality of placing this kind of treatment with fire on a member, is, that you light a candle from linen at a distance, or a small candle made of wax: and put it over the middle of the rod which runs through it, so that the heat surrounds the lower part of the wound slightly, so as not to burn the body.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then put it on the member: and let a finger be placed over the hole which I have said, until we hold the wound: while we hold it, take away the finger, and the steam will come out of that hole, and immediately the wound will be released.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then the fire from the candle, according to its way, and repeat this treatment if you can bear it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In Ventosa, however, which is administered in pleural disease with water, there is no wire across, nor a hole; and it is not administered except that water is filled and put on the limb alone.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this Ventosa is all the more large, so that it may hold much water, it is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	[ ¶ On the suspension of blood-sugar.]
Caput XCIX.	Chapter LIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Sanguisugae are not administered in many, except in those limbs where it is not possible to place a wound-drape because of their smallness, such as the lip, and the gums, and things like them.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a naked limb, bare of flesh, such as a finger, and a nose, and things like them.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality for using them is: that you take those which are in sweet waters, clean from corruption.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are left to rest during the day and night in sweet water, until they are hungry, and there remains nothing in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is evacuated of blood in the first place with phlebotomy, and with wound-drape.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then the nurse washes the limb, until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then they are placed on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are filled, and fall, and it is possible to place the wound-drape on the spot, then it is better, and if not, then wash the spot with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and a rub, and is pressed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the course of blood is prolonged after the application of blood-sugar, and it is a residue: then put a linen cloth in cold water, and place the body upside down, until the residue is separated.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood multiplies, then powder of astringent is scattered on top of the body, crushed, or feathers, and things like them: until the blood is separated.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or let half of herbs with an irritating principle be placed on the spot: and are left, until the herbs stick to the spot, because the blood is separated.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	It is necessary to go again if necessary when it is possible to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if the blood-suckers are forbidden from suspension, then the place should be cleaned with recent blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or fasten them now in places until someone leaves some blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they are placed, because when they sense some blood, they adhere immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When you want to drop them, sprinkle over them some ground aloe, or salt, or dust; and they fall immediately.

Caput I.	[Head I].
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also often needed in the art of medicine, and it deals with the restoration of fractures and dislocations of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know ye, O sons, because they speak stolidly of this chapter to the doctors and to the laypeople, and have not examined the ancient book, and have not read its letter;
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason it is made, that this mode from the sciences in our land is reserved.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I was not bored in it at all, and I have not been satisfied from it unless because of the length of reading of the ancient books, and study on their understanding, until I drew the science of it from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then by experimentation and study of a long life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And I have already described to you from it all that contains my science: and on what has passed beyond experimentation of mine, after I have shortened it for you, and have released it from the occupation of elongation, and have shortened it at the end of abbreviation, and have shown it at the end of declination: and I have formed in it many forms from forms of instruments that are administered in it, with the addition of declination, as I did in two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturales ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessária est, antequam incipiamus remembrance membrorum fractorum, et diversorum, si unicusuique.
Caput II.	Head II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	In the prolog of this chapter, we shall discuss the summary of the topic and the chapters that deal with the concept of station of bones: so that you, and those who are eager to know or learn this noble craft from you, may know it, or learn it from others.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, then, that when a fracture, or dislocation, or twisting, or fall has occurred to someone: then you should prepare first to bleed him, and to solve the problem, or both at the same time: unless there is something that prohibits it, such as the weakness of virility: or he is one in whom this thing has happened, a boy, or an old man: or it is a time of great fever, or of cold greatly.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be satisfied with his food, cold dishes, and chicken, and meat that is tough, and avoid filling the veins with wine, or fatty meats, or whatever fills the belly with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until you are secure from the heat of fever, and do not hasten to pour matter into the member: then let the sick one return to his normal routine with which he is accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the jaw is beginning to be mended, then it is necessary that the sick person eat food that is nutrient, thick, dark, and full of liquid: such as food made from wheat mixed with water, and rice, and heads (of meat), and feet, and livers of fowl, and recent fish: and strong wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	Since this regimen brings about a quicker and better healing of the fracture.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And you must know that bones that are fractured, when they are in the years of old age, and decrepitude, cannot continue and consolidate themselves according to their nature forever, because of the drying out of the member: and they consolidate and continue those that are at the end of leniitude, such as young men's bones.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And you should know that the types of fractures are diverse, depending on the different parts of the body; for example, a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull, and a fracture of the breastbone is different from a fracture of the spine. And likewise, each member has its own distinctive features in terms of injury; and I will come to that with an explanation of each type of fracture, distinguishing it from other types, in its own chapter.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the species of fractures of bones also differ from one another:
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Since a fracture occurs when a bone is bent out of shape, apart from the fact that it happens in an arch.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes a fracture occurs along the length of the bone; and there are fractures that occur at an angle, that is, in an arch, and additions that come about, such as those that form in the reed when it is cut with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And there are also fractures that do not originate; and there is a fracture with a chip and a crack at the tip; and there is a small fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And each type has its own tool or special device for restoring it, as the memory of each type is distinct in its own place.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from this it can be recognized what type of bone fracture it is; that is, its curvature and eminence; and its feel to the touch, and the sound it makes when you squeeze it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	So when there is no curvature visible, nor a sound of creaking when you touch it with your hand, and there is not a great deal of pain; then it is not a fracture, but it may well be that there is a curvature or a small crack; so you need not move it about with your hand at all, except that you should place something from the doctors on top of it, whose memory has come to you, after a while in which it has settled into its place: then bind it tightly with a narrow band.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you should know that the part which is when it arches and is divided into two, except for what happens to him of satagues, really all parts are moved from their comparison: then it is necessary for you so that you begin from your hour to rectify it, equalizing it before it happens to him a posthemia warm.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if it happens to him a posthemia warm, then leave him for a few days until he is calm apoestema.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then make equal the part according to any way you can from laziness and art.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And you should know that the restoration of it and its equating is easier than the bones, in which satagues happen.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tighten the part, according to what comes to you the memory of it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	But if the satagues are in the bone, then necessary is the extension of this broken member from two parts, if hand sits, or foot: or with your hand, if the member is small: or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And your position which you put the member on a place equal, according to its natural figure, until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then try, so that you make those additions with all art, and according to any way you can in their places: and carefully according to your strength, so that does not happen on the weak through your operation, nor relaxation: and carefully according to your strength, that you apply one two bones with his partner, according to better shapes.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary in that hour, so that you try and touch the member with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	But if you see there something different, rectify the part, and equating it by your quantity of strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And carefully the extension rapid, and strong compression, as do many stiff.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For often happen through their operation the posthemia warm, or contraction in a member: as we have already seen that from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then after resting, and when the operation is done and the member is fixed, quiet and peaceful: and remind the sick person of himself.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And let the person be cautious, so that he does not fidget in his hours of illness, and his sleep is not disturbed during his resolution, and his agitation, and his digestion, and all his movements in the last strength of him.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And so that he is cautious, let not be a position of the member with which pain follows.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, because when he feels pain in the disposition of the member's position, or injury: then it should be, that you turn him over to another disposition from which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And be cautious with him, so that his position is equal and straight: so that no tortuosity occurs in the member when he is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of a broken member's tightness is according to the width.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You know that broken members differ in their width, and their size, and their form.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Which of them are small, such as the arm, and the finger, and the fin, and the like to them, then it should be, that the cloth be soft and thin.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Which, however, are thick, such as the hip, and the shin, it should be that cloth is thick and hard.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Since the broad ligament connects a large member, and tightens it with equal tightness so that it does not enter it stain.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then after your evacuation begin to put on a lotion suitable for him, in a soft wrap over the break site.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap three or four times the ligament over the break site, according to the length of the member: and tighten your hand slightly with the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then walk with him on the upper side from the break location, and tighten less than your tightness, which you tightened the broken spot.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then lengthen yourself with the wrapping slightly from the break location, and soften your tightness gradually, until you take hold of a large healthy joint.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take a new one and roll it again over the broken place with carresses.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then move it with the carresses to the lower side from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And your operation shall be in the tightening of the carresses and softening of it, according as we said in the first carress.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then put between the carresses a soft cloth or a pad as it is suitable for the curvature of the fracture, if there is any curvature: and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then roll again on the new one.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then set an equal distance between these carresses that are made askew at once, if there is no swelling or heat in the place.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If there is any swelling or heat in it: then put over it that which sits down the swelling, and let it take away the swelling: and let it go for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tighten again on the place at once when
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the carresses be of the width of a lathe's blade, smooth, and shaped wisely: or of wood from which are made gratings, which are made of pine, or of branches of palm, or of calinger: and let the amplitude of each carress be according to this form, and this figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, let the carress that is put over the traction be a little thicker and wider than the other carresses: and the length of the carress let be according to the size and proportion of the member.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tighten again on the carresses with a new one according to the first tension.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind from above with the fils that are made askew according to what we said about the tension: and it is, so that your tension shall be over the broken place more: and as much as the length from the fracture increases, the tension shall decrease.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And let the fils be of middle thickness and softness, and of soft cloth.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the fils are thick, as the fils that are put from the dull surgery of the blind by means of twisted cords of linen, it is a great mistake: for the tension falls with them out of the right place.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And thin sutures again do not agree: for you do not achieve that which you wish by means of a rigid one with them.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary, so that it be between an anchor and an anchor less than the length of a finger.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	That if a sick person is injured through the ends of the sutures after a rigid one in healthy places: then place under them from soft cloth, or red wool, until there is no pain from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When however there is a fracture with an ulnar bone, and there has been a break on the skin, I will return to it in the second chapter with regard to its uniqueness.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And you should know that not every broken member needs to be sutured from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is, because the member is large when it is, one should not put it on top of the sutures, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the development of seroma.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of the ancient way of applying plaster, which are placed on top of a fracture and a dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The common abbreviated way of plastering, restoring a fracture with various compositions, especially for women and children, because it does not hurt from heat, nor from cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is so that you take from a flour miller, and there is wheat flour hanging on the walls of a rolling mill: and you make it like this, except for the cobwebs with alum: and you place its coating not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	The other way of plastering, restoring a fracture, and a dislocation, and a twist.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take alum, and myrrh, and acacia, and cow dung, and oil: and honey of both sexes, from 5 to 10 inches of myrrh, and alethos (an aromatic plant) in equal parts, if the composition is for a healing wound: or with alum, if the plaster is to be warm.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then put this plaster thereon.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, restores broken bones quickly, and suits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	A different way of making the plaster, which also suits fractures and twists.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take the wool of a sheep, and the flour of wheat, and of myrrh X drachms, and of aloes both kinds V drachms, and of acacia VI drachms, and of balm XX drachms finely ground; all of these are heavily bruised and rubbed together, and made into a paste with water or almond milk: and they are given.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	A method of making the plaster for joints, and bones separated from their sites: which will ease their pain, and the break in the bone's connection, and the fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	The sheep' wool is soaked in vinegar, and in oil boiled up; and it is placed on the place.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this very plaster there is no virtue of restoration, but it is good for calming hot swellings; and it drives away its own pains.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	A method of making the plaster, which restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves from an oak tree and leaves from a fig tree; both finely ground, and all are thoroughly rubbed together, and made into a plaster with the two.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	A method of making a short plaster, to be used in restoring a broken bone; and when you wish to relieve a hot swelling remaining.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take the root of the marsh-mallow, and of camomile, and of the flowers of the plantain, and of herb-seed; all of these are finely ground as one part; all are thoroughly rubbed together, and made into a paste with wine, if it is a limb that has been warmed.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If, however, it is warm, then make the plaster with wine and coriander seed; or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	A stronger method of making the plaster, which is more effective in the resolution of a hard swelling that occurs during the restoration of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take the root of the marsh-mallow, and of flax seed, and of poplar bark, and of mealy-fruit, and of sage, and of the flowers of the plantain, and of camomile; all of these are finely ground as one part; all are thoroughly rubbed together, and made into a paste with water from willow-buds, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All this depends on the warmth of the member, and the calmness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates, in his book, did not say that a broken member should be placed in restoration of its function unless it is made of brass and oil: nothing else: and he relates that it should be of a middle degree between solidity and lightness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	But Galen, on the other hand, has said that for the restoration of a broken member it is necessary to apply substances in which there is a drying up of heat, such as myrrh and aloe and olive oil and similar things which we have related.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The mode of the poultice which is useful for wounds and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take the yolks of eggs, and the teeth of horses or birds, and the feathers of birds, and the ears of corn, and salt in equal parts: they are to be pounded and sifted and made into a poultice.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	But as to the quantity, which you are to use, that it may remain on the member, and then be dissolved, consider this, if you do not find that the pain, or itching, or the broken bone is moved from its place: then do not dissolve it over many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If, however, there is a stinging itching in the place, or an unsettling pain, or swelling: then apply and dissolve it at once, and take off the poultice: and take a cloth, or sponge, wet with water: and dip it into the water, and wash away the place, until the itching is calmed, and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the member rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then put over it a cloth dampened with vinegar and oil, or with oil only: and bind it on for the night, so that you are not troubled by heat, and the swelling of the member is calmed, and the pain of the member subsides.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then frequently apply a small poultice: and do not strangle it with your own throat, or with anything tight, until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	That if you see, what the aposteme, and rubedo, and pain, and swelling, and all the accidents are now entirely removed, and you have plastered and tightened, then repeat that as you did at first equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	That if anything does not happen to the member among those which we have said, then do not separate it, unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when the member is dismissed after forty days all that, according to what appears to you from the solution of the member, as we have said, until such time as the fracture seems to have adhered, and the coagulation of the flesh above it has approximated: add also then to the striciture more than your first stricitur: and add also to the engorgement of food according to what preceded its remembrance.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	But if you see the place of the fracture already drying up, and waning more than is necessary: then know that food is forbidden to reach it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	So wet the member with warm water wherever you solve it, and let it be for all three days, and add a little relaxation to the stricitur.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	By this operation then runs to the member food, and heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But that which the dull restaurators do from the fracture of a member, when they do not restore it first, according to what is necessary, and restore it according to its tortuosity, is an error from their operation, and a great fear: and if it had been right, the ancient ones would have said it in their books, and performed it with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see any trace of them at all on that, and it is better that that should not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Regarding the making of an accident in the head.
Caput III.	CHAPTER III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	There are diverse kinds of fractures, and many forms of them: and their causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For from a fracture is made what is by impact with an instrument: and the impact carries the whole bone away until it reaches the syphac, which is under the bone, as does the axe in the wood: and therefore this kind of fracture is called the axial fracture.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	The blade of the knife hit some bone, and it hit his face, and did not cut all the way to the last of it: and this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, absolute Levation.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And a fracture is between two fractures, or large, or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And from a fracture comes contusion, or friction: and its cause is hitting with a stone, or falling on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also piercing, which is beginning to approach a flap, which is under the bone: or is in the face of the bone: and this kind of fracture is also between two fractures, or small, or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And from a fracture is one that is hidden in the bone in a slender hair: and it is a small crack, and for this reason this kind of fracture is called the species of fracture Capillus.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from them is a fracture that is made by fall or hitting of a stone, and similar things, which makes the layer of bone go inside, and it is made up of concavity: such as happens with the caldarii of air when there is a fall on them, and part of them goes inside.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And much more does this happen in the heads of the humeral bones, as are the heads of boys.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these kinds of fracture have separate healing, and I shall mention it again when I speak about them all together in their places.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we know all these kinds of fractures by inspection on them, and by inquiring about them with the help of tests, and by removing the corrupted flesh that is above them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The species Capillus is recognized by this, that it is discovered on the bone, and is scrubbed, and is held over itself with caustic: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the cure of a fracture, take into consideration at first the nursing injuries: then if you see that there are symptoms of recovery, as loss of appetite due to worry, or cholera, or spread, or loss of mind, or loss of speech, or fainting, or high fever, or blinking of eyes, and redness of them, and similar things from among these many signs of concern, it is certainly impossible for it to heal: and if you see that there are non-worrying symptoms, and you hope for recovery: then begin its cure.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	What is, if it comes to you wounded first when wounded: and it is that in the days of the half, then it should be, that you study in the ablation of bone before the fourteenth day second all disposition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the days of summer, then it should be, that you remove the bone before the seventh day, before the corruption that is under the bone from the pannicle, and those accidents which we have described.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	That if the fracture of the bone has already reached to the pannicle touching the brain, and is with small, and attraction: then it should be, that you fall on the broken side, and ground, according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is, that you shave the head of the wounded: and you discover over the bone in any way possible to you: and according to the figure of the wound, and what is more relaxed over the weak.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	That if it happens to you during the detection of the bone of a flow of blood, or hot poultice: then you oppose to him with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is, that you fill the place with rags soaked in wine, and roasted oil: and you make the wound quiet, until the poultice stops, and you are safe from a flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the cure of the bone, and in its ablation.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to two ways.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One way indeed is, that you fall on the bone with a sharp and narrow chisel: and this is the form of it.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then another way is, that you administer a wider chisel after a narrow one: and this is the form of it.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then also adminster another wider chisel than the second: and this is the form of it.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	Then the second way is, that there be with you a number of chisels different: some are wider to some, and some shorter to some: and they are in the last end of their sharpness, and are made of iron, or fuel: and you use convenience in striking on the chisel, so that it does not hurt the head, and harms itself.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If the jaw is strong and firm: then you should perform the incisions around it before administering the incisions with the scalpel on the bones called ribs, which are not deep: and they are not so named unless they do not pass beyond the end of the bone to that which is after it; therefore, because the rib is a round extremity above that which is sharp under its head, similar to its margin, and a small circle prevents it from diving into, and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting that you should take from these ribs a great number, each of which corresponds to the thickness of the bone, until you have all the cranium with Terribles: the extremity of whose sharpness in length and brevity corresponds to the quantity of its thickness, as was said above.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the shape of the three kinds of Terribles, or trepanations.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of the piercing around the broken bone is: that you put the rib on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the rib to another place and put what is between all the holes of the thickness of the radius or around it.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the scalpel what is between all the holes from the bone and make it thinner than you can from the end of lightness, as we said, until you have eroded the bone, or by hand, or with any other instrument that you have prepared for it: such as knives, and fine awls.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary, so that you take all the precautions, that the rib or the scalpel does not touch anything sharp.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have thus pierced around the bone and separated it from the shell, if it is continuous with it, and extract it, then you should shave it, and make the same extremity of it that remains in the bone with another similar scalpel.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it is necessary that it be thin and subtle rather than other scalpel.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If there remains anything of the small bones and the joint: then take it with ease, along with that which is with you of the instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound after that with liniments, and the ointment which we have mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another way of operation is easy, far from fear: which said Galen, and praised it greatly: and this is his speech.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	Necessarily it is to you first, that you begin to grasp the part of bone in which the fracture is more painful, and more manifest: until when you have grasped that part, and put under it the extreme end of this lenticular incision, whose this form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lenticular part, does not cut anything: and the acute part of it in its two sides running in length, as you see: that it may be the lenticular part laid on the siphum, face of it incident acute in the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike over the Incisorium from one side with a small mallet, until you hit all of the bone with ease, as it moves around: and you are safe from the panicule, which does not happen in that accident, which you fear most truly.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the medicans is not stupider of men, and more ignorant of his own, and is not sleeping, then if there remained anything attached to the bone from the pannicle in some places, he would strike it away from him with the extreme end of this lenticular incision, and set it free from him with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is set free from him without injury, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate as far as the pannicle, and that which is cut off from the bone is the shape of it, and there remain in it roughness and subtile satagiae: then it is necessary, that you rub off that roughness, and pluck out those satagiae with fine rasors, which you have prepared of various quantities, so that it may be possible for you to administer them in every place more convenient for them, and more right of their shape, according to the operation to which it leads you, and the broken bone, and its form.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	It is necessary that you should make your incisions in your teeth, at first roots, widely apart from each other.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use a thinner knife after the incision.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do that according to continuity, until you have come to administer a thin one, and thinner of all of them.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each of the other cracks between the teeth, and in the small fracture, it is necessary that you should administer care, according to that which leads to the straightening of it.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And this is a thing which is not hidden over all, to which in this art there is whatever study, and it stood on that which we have written, and shown in the large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	But if a flap of skin is held back, when you cut the teeth: then it is necessary that you should take a piece of linen cloth, according to the quantity of wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another piece of cloth, doubled or tripled, immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and do that which you can more easily over it, so that it does not stick to the sponge.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer over it a wide bandage: and do not tighten it, unless according to the quantity which holds the wound only: and let go of it with this cure for one day, or two days, until you are free from fever.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve it, and administer after it the medicines with which there is no need for dryness: such as the roots of lily, and flour of herb, and powder of thorn, and of aristocha, and similar to them: and it is, that you make from these medicines a powder, which is powdered over the wound like these are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And administer universally in it any medicine of its property which is to cleanse, and not to sting.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And take care according to your virtue, that the wound in your cure is clear: and that it is not in it any oil of ointment, or any dirtiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not let the virus aggregate therein at all; for when the virus aggregates over the brain's skin, it corrupts and腐敗 it, and a great evil befalls those who are weak after that: and already it has happened in the head's sinkhole, when he was opened from him a hole, especially when his care was neglected, and blackness appeared on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Consider therefore then, if those accidents happen to the sick which we have said, you will know that it is certainly fatal.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not happen, unless it is because of the medicine which is put on it, and it is in the strength of its medicine, so that it makes it black: then you must take from honey one part, from rose oil three parts, and with them a cloth;
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then put the head on the sinkhole: then care for the head with the species of cure which are appropriate, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	The restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You know that the nose is not broken unless both of its upper parts break at the same time, or one of them; for it has two bones: since its lower part is cartilaginous, it is not broken, and does not happen to it except by rubbing, and tortuosity, and asymmetry.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of its two parts is broken, then you must put your little finger in the nose's hole, and make it equal with your own finger, and your thumb closed, until the nose returns to its natural shape: and let it be done with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And so that it does not happen to him during your operation that he suffers from pain on the sick bed.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	That if the break is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach that finger: then you must make equal the end at which there is a little thickeness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	But if the break is in the two parts, then make it similar to that one: and follow with its restoration on the first day when it was broken, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then on the seventh day, or the tenth near the quiet of the apices hot.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then put into the extremities of the nose the li-chinium from a cloth, if it is broken in one part: or put two li-chinia if it is broken in two parts: and sit in the li-chinium with such a quantity as fills the hole of the nose.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And certain ancient restorers said, let the li-chinia be poured into butter, and be changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That is not really what I think should be done, however, it is necessary that the li-chinium be poured into the albus (bone) with the powder of the grinding, when it is thoroughly mixed.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then let the li-chinium go, until the os (bone) hardens, and the cartilage is hardened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And when a feather of an goose is put in the place of the li-chinium, after it has been wrapped in a soft cloth; and it is done, so that it holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, and does not prevent the sick from inhaling.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	This is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do so: and if you wish, make it with li-chinia.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	That if the nose should again be injured while you are operating on an apostemous wound that is hot, bandage it with wax, or with a cotton wadded up with rose-oil, or with a little of dacquilion.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	But if the apostema is not hot, then it should be bandaged with a powder of sisa-me, and the powder of the thuris that has been made into paste with albus (bone) be applied to it.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then put a soft cloth on top of it, and do not bandage the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	But if the bones of the nose are broken or crushed, then you should split them open, and extract the bones with the instruments that are suitable for this purpose.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then cut it off, and take care of the flesh that has become incarnate, and consolidated from the bandages that are suitable for it, or with a paste.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If a fracture occurs between the nose and upper lip, then one should treat it with lint, and administer a plumb-lined catheter until healing occurs.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	¶ On restoration of the lower jaw, when broken.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken and not connected to the upper jaw, and it does not break into two pieces and does not hurt on the inside: then one can easily recognize it.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	So, if the fracture is on the right side of the jaw, insert your left index finger into the mouth to feel: likewise, if the fracture is on the left side of the jaw, then insert your right index finger: and push it from inside with ease towards the outside with your other hand from the inside of the bone, and adjust it straight.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture has already separated into two parts, then one should administer external pressure from both sides, straightening it out: until adjustment is possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	But if a tooth has already been disturbed or broken off: then tighten them with gold wire, silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a poultice on the fractured jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place a double-layered cloth over the injury, and a large piece of skin cut to match the length of the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then tie it from above, as you have prepared the binding material, and let it rest until it does not hurt: and instruct the patient to use a soft diet.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	But if you think that some of his features have changed in any way: then adjust it and remove it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then straighten out what has been disturbed and cover the injury with flour that has been sieved or ground wheat, after you have removed the poultice: and place a layer of wool over it.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While that wool remains attached to the injury and the bone's position does not change, let it be, and do not remove it, until healing occurs: or tighten the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	Many times this fracture is tied up with seven threads.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	For if during the time between then and now a warm apoplexium occurs, then administer to it what we have said many times in sedating it, until it removes that apoplexium.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with the ulna, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	Nam if a fragment has separated from the bone, or if it is from a saw-tooth: then be careful in this case so that you remove those saw-tooth fragments with that which comes with you when you take them off from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	But if the wound of the ulcer is tight, then enlarge it with a phlebotechnition according to the quantity of your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you remove those saw-tooth fragments, and if none remain, then close that wound if it is wide; and if not, put on top of it the plasters which suit it, and let it flesh over, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	As for the restoration of the fork, when it breaks.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Much of the time the Fork breaks from the front part of the shoulder, and its fracture is made in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or if it breaks and separates into two, except that they happen to fall into saw-tooth: and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or else, so that they happen to the saw-tooth bone: and it is more difficult to restore it.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or else, so that the fracture is with the ulna.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in it when the fracture is without the ulna, is, that you make these two ministers hold one another, so that the broken Fork has a support on one side, and the other extends the neck toward the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then make the fractures of your fingers equal, until it takes its shape according to what is needed: and do not leave a protuberance in it, nor a depression.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	But if you need to extend it more, then it is necessary that you put under a tickling sphere of cloth or wool: and make its size according to the quantity of your need: and extend it, and close the Fork, and hold the sphere with your hand, until it takes its shape, according to which you need.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot bring the end of the furcula to the outside, since it has gone deep inside: then let the sick person lie on their back on a tray; and place the fulcrum under their shoulder blade in the middle in size, and press down the minister of their shoulder to the lower part, until they lift up the jaw of the furcula that is in deep to the top: and then adjust the fracture straight, and make it equal with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel a lump in the furcula, and it moves: then let you find on it, and pull out the lump with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is stuck in the bone, then use the incisorium you have prepared for it, after you have placed under the furcula an instrument that keeps it apart: and this instrument is made of wood, or of iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is joined to the cochlea where it is not closed.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width should be according to that in which you sit, of the size of the bone, and of its shape.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	The length also should be according to what is possible for you in the work.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it has two ends, as you see: and one end is wide, and the other is narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If the break in the bone that you made when you pulled out the lump is wide, and secures with the warm thread: then join the two lips of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the break is small, or you have no warm thread: then fill the wound with rags, and dust, according to the quantity of the cut in the flesh.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If it happens that the warm thread has run out: then pour the rag in oil of roses, and vinegar, and wine, and place on it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The stricture of the bone, when it is without a wound, and without a cut, is, that you place on the bone a plaster made from milled flour with alum.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a beam of wood on top of it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then put the ball under his tickle, if you wish it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take the hemolate, that is, the wheel which the Saracens hold, which is long and wide: and let the width of it be that of a palm, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then put a doubled pillow on the bed and a cushion.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take an astel from a thin table, the width of which is that of three fingers, and in length also similar.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then roll it up in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then roll up the cloth with the Astel in the place of the bone which fell on the fracture and the spot.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then put the bone on the fracture like a roll, and roll it up over his neck, and under his tickle, healthy and sick: and reduce it over all parts, and see how the stricture holds the fracture, and that is why it does not obscure you, and all, so that it does not move the Astel from above the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this, it is necessary that you should see the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever therefore the ligament becomes soft, and you see the Astel has moved a little: then make it right again, and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then put a light sleep on his back, and under his tickle put a small pillow near his side so that he may be helped by it from his side when he wakes up at night.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Thus is the fracture of the forearm healed by the elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the ligature, if it does not happen in place due to a scratch, or from an appointment, until twelve days have passed.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then put back the cushion, if you see his face towards that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the stricture, and let him go, until he is restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fracture of the forearm is tightened and healed after about fifty days: and sometimes it happens in some people sooner.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	De restoratione fractura spatulae.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII. On the Restoration of a Fractured Spatel.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	Rarely does a spatula break, and in that case it is on the side; and it does not break from it except for its edge.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When it does break from one side, and breaks in the middle of it, and is not known except by touch: then, according to its figure, prepare the treatment.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it back to its natural position by all the skill you can muster, which is possible for you to do.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then put on the wound a poultice of flour damped with alum, and a chip board, and place on top a bit of cloth double- layered.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then put on the table over it a thin iron stake according to the length of the spatula in question, or a larger one if needed.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If the broken end of the spatula is under a stake, then make it equal with the chip board, until the stake comes down to the right level.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then tie it up with long threads, a little tight, and with the firmness of the stake, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligature every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever the ligature softens, tighten it again, and make the stake equal if it moves from its place: and let the injured one lie on the sound side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And a spatula is restored in twenty or thirty days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number is complete, then loosen the ligature: and you shall be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For that is of bone, whose joint is not afraid, and its release is not feared.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	But if it proceeds from the end of a bone, and prickles under the skin: then cut off on top, and take it away.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do as we said in the fracture of a fork from sitting on a hot thing, if something happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Chapter VII. On the Restoration of a Fractured Pectoral Bone.
Caput VIII.	Head VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest sometimes breaks in the middle of its own self, and this rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	The extremities of the body are indeed most subject to breaking, and are destroyed by the accidents that befall them.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When the middle of his chest breaks, which turns downward toward his lower extremities, then a great pain happens to him, and difficulty in breathing, and perhaps he spits up blood, and it becomes evident that there is a fracture in one of his bones, and it does not conceal its sensation, The restoration of him is so that he should lie down on his back: and put between the blades of his hands.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then he should press his shoulders and gather the ribs from both sides with his hands: and gently adjust him to the right position, in whatever way is possible for that to be achieved, so that he may recover his rib cage shape, as it should be.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then he should place over himself an embalming cloth and a mat, and put under him a wooden board from a thin piece of wood, or a similar one, in a state of levity, after you have wrapped it in a cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then gently adjust him with a ligature over the broken bone so that it does not move: and sometimes, with the ligature following the curvature to his back, and tighten him by tightening it on the falling.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the ligature every hour, and whenever it becomes soft, tighten it: and if need be to relieve a skin itch, or corrosion which has occurred in that place, or pain, or swelling: then approach and loosen it, and remove the embalming cloth, and set right whatever has happened during the course of its cure.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the embalming cloth, if you see it fit to do so: and attach a ligature, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	The restoration of ribs, when they break.
Caput IX.	Head IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You should know that rib fractures do not occur unless in the large spaces behind the back, and from the ends of the ribs on the anterior part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not happen to them through friction, unless because they are cartilage.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of this does not hide from the sense in inquiry when the fingers are used.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And the restoration of it is made so that the fracture with the fingers is equal when possible, until it is equal in form, according to what is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then put a splint on and tightly bind the broken bone with a stick, if it needs it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture is of the ribs and it has broken open into the inside: then there comes a severe pain to the sick person, and a puncturing, as that which happens to him who has pleurisy: for the bone rubs the membrane, and also there comes to him a difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and much blood. And this is a difficult cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancient people have devised many methods in it: and from them are those who say, put on food that generates inflammation and ventilation, so that the abdomen is inflamed, and spread out, and driven out the fracture to the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	But we reject it, so that there is no cause for making a hot poultice quickly, unless it happens.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if it has already happened, then add this to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: put on a place that is windy, and then blow upon it with force, and it is like the reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	But they fear that the wind will draw away the fluid to the place, because of the weakness of the disposition.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: it is necessary that the place be covered with wool which has already been immersed in hot oil: and put feathers between the ribs, until it is filled up: so that the binding is equal when it is turned round.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the sick person will be cured by the curing of pleurisy from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	That if he binds the sick person who hurts him, which he does not bear, and the bone rubs the membrane, and we fear for the sick person: then it is necessary that we should split the place, and discover the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us place upon it an instrument which conserves the soft part, whose memory precedes: and let us incise the bone with ease, and let us incise itself.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then let us gather together two lips of the wound, if it is large with stitches: and let us dress it with plasters, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	That if during the time there happens to be a hot swelling, then let it come forward, and pour dust in oil of rose and place it on the spot: and let the sick be dressed with it as is fitting for the swelling.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	At the same time also let it rest upon its side where it sleeps, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	De restoratione fracture spondylum dorsi et colli.
Caput X.	The restoration of a fracture of the spine and neck.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Of the bones of the neck when there happens to be a fracture, and rarely does it happen that they are worn away: and likewise of the vertebrae of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	So then if it happens to someone and you want to know, whether it heals or not: then trust it.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see its hands already softened, and stupefied, and dead: and cannot be moved nor extended, nor pressed together: and when you press them with your fingers, and prick them with a pin, it does not feel nor does it hurt: then know that it is not healed, and in many respects it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	That if it moves them and feels the constriction with your fingers and the prick: then know that the bones of the neck are healed, and that the sick person will heal with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	That if it is similar to that of the spine and neck, and you want to know whether it heals as well or not: then consider its feet: then if you see that they are softened, and what happens to them as happens in the hands: but when he lies on his back, he walks with a swaying motion and without will: and when he is placed upon his stomach, he wants to drink, and cannot: then know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	I therefore will not detail his work in curing him.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If nothing at all happens to him from this, the matter is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the cure of him that happened from it is, as you know, a sedative for boils of heat: so, as you put on oil of rose only spined: or when you walk with a man who has been bathed.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place over that again a few times in the day until it is well sedated: then place over the spot one of the comforting plasters, drying up, and tightly bound to it with a bandage: and order the sick man to use quietness and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And let him not lie on the part where he feels pain until it is well healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	That if something happens to the bone that has become separated, or anything that has already been separated from it: then you must let the wound heal over, and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then take two pieces of skin, if it is large, with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then the cure for him with something that has become inflamed, with ointment, until it is well healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If afterwards the bone of the hand is broken and the end is cut off: then you must put the thumb of the left hand into the joint, and with the other hand, as well as possible, and in the second case, equalize it.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place over it, and take it off: and the cure for fractures with the preceding cure, until it is well healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	The restoration of bones.
Caput XI.	CHAPTER XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Bones rarely break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they break, then the fracture is not, unless it splits at the ends of the bones: and they split along their length, and bend inward towards the inside: and the injury to the foot that breaks makes a pain in the place where it is, and it bleeds.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration of it is, as you stretch your hand over it, until you are standing on top of the fracture; which is shown in this figure.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only in the extremities of it, then make that fracture equal, according to what was prepared for you from equality, until its figure becomes similar to its natural one.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If the fracture is along its length, or has already turned towards the insides: then make the patient lie on his stomach, until the restoration of that fracture has been prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have made that equal, place over it a plaster; then place over it a wooden support, or a skin, and tightly tighten the bandage over what you do not fear a change in the fracture, and do not remove the support.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And make that equal concavity with it so that it fills it, until it takes it by means of the equality: and order the infirm man to sleep on his back, or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If, however, he has a hot swelling: then cease from extending it, and also from its restoration, until it subsides: and place over him what he sits, according to what preceded, and then return to its restoration: and tightly bind him as it should be.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If, however, it has broken through the bone, or has been crushed, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	The assistant for the restoration of a fracture.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The aide is that which is between the cradle until the head of the spatel.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If, however, it breaks, then its restoration is according to two ways.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	Of which one is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And bind together with two ligaments at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then hang it from a raised place: and let the infirm man sit on a chair.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then let him throw his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches up to its knot, into which is attached a piece of wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang it from above the man with something heavy so that he can extend his hand towards the bottom.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then let the physician bind the break with bandages, until the fracture has healed, as is required.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another mode is so that the sick person lies on his back on his chest: and his hand is suspended from his neck with a rope.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then order two servants, that one of them hold that which is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other holds below him, and extends each of them on his side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish that the extension be stronger, then tie under the fracture with a rope, and above it with another rope: and let each of the two servants extend them on their sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If then the fracture is near the end of the arm, then it is necessary that there be one rope under the collar-bone, and another rope under the fracture opposite the shoulder.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And likewise if the fracture is near the hip: then it is necessary that there be one rope over that place, and over the hip itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then bind the fracture with ease without work, until such time as it is equal to that which is required, and applied in a good way: then tie it, if there does not occur a swelling of heat.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	But if a swelling of heat occurs, then dismiss the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place on him a woolen cloth soaked in vinegar and olive oil, until such time as the swelling subsides: then bind it: and the mode of binding it is so that you place a sponge over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place on him a new cloth for washing out above the sponge.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then make the arm rest on the side of his body, and let him place his hand open on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place the cloth, and tie over the arm as if to support the arm by the stars: if he does not prevent you from doing so, nor should anything change on him or in you that is broken.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	That if you should find that anything changes on him or in you that is broken, then use the stars: and it is as if you place on the fracture a star which is broader and stronger than the others.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between every hand-span a finger's width; and make the length of the hands according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers from every part.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind tightly on top of the hands the constriction which I have said at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And let it be, so that your constriction is tighter over the site of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And as much as the fracture is lengthened, the constriction is less tight.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	But if you see that the hand-spans are longer and the constriction is looser, as we have said, in the hour when you restore the member to life immediately then do so: but if you wait for the swelling to go down, then remove the constriction and the hands until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the tendon for all three days, so that there does not remain any itching or swelling at the site, nor does it prevent food from reaching the member because of the inflammation of the swelling.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	So adjust that entire thing as we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	But if you are in doubt, so that nothing comes out of it: then do not remove the tendon, until after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the nurse lie on her back and her hands on her belly; and place under her head a bed covered with wool evenly distributed.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider every hour of the night or day so that the broken member does not come loose, nor do the ligaments soften.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	So adjust that entire thing with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And provide the nurse with food according to the order which we have set out, so that there is a light meal at first, until the jaw begins to close: then it should be increased, so that he gains weight.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the tradition of the aide and the limb is that it be bound for forty days; then it should be released, and given a bath, and treated with ointment which straightens it out.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is putrid or worn away then do not remove the tendon and the hands until fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	 ¶ On the restoration of fractures of the arm (brachii).
Caput XIII.	De restaurando fracturam brachii.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm (brachium) is composed of two bones, which are called the two "focilia".
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One is small, and it is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	The other is large, and this one is placed below the little finger on the lower side.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore does break only the larger  "focile", or the smaller; and perhaps do both break at the same time.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore does break the smaller "focile" from above, then is the restoration of it easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when does break the lower "focile", it is a bad fracture, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And worse is it, when both bones break at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore is broken only a small "focile" on the upper side, then should the doctor be present at the restoration of it, in order that he place the long arm with ease until it is even.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	However, if only the larger "focile" has broken: then should he place a tighter fastener with force.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary to place the form of the hand at the restoration of it, and its long extension above the wrist.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be placed on its higher side for all the fingers; and let the flexor be placed for all the fingers, or any other; and let the person sit on a square before himself, or facing it, or directly in front of it, at an equal height, so that he does not suffer trouble.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then he should extend the arm from its lower side, or with his hand, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another minister should extend from above in the same way.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the doctor should even out the bone, until he reduces it according to the best form that he can obtain.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If also in the fracture of the bone are seen pieces (shards), then should you endeavor to reduce any fragment in its place with your skill.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If there appears to be a sathium or separate body part, and you stab the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then find over it, and take it away according to the way that we have said in those that precede these.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	But if there is a fracture with an arrow, I have already done to that separate chapter, so take the cure of it from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	That if it should happen in the beginning of your restoration a warm apostematon, then make a thin cloth with a bright color made from oil rubbed, and white, and sit between the thickness and subtility: and tighten the cloth on the strictness with subtlety, until when it sits down the apostema: then remove the caerums, and put an preparatum emplاستر from dust of molendini with albumin.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then put on stars, and let the star that is put on the fracture be wider a little, and stronger: and
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And you should know that the number of stars of the arm is six in several dispositions: whether it is a fracture in one ray, or in two rays simultaneously.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then put on your stricture over the place of the fracture stronger and more painful, and a little more with the stricture to the upper fracture, or to the lower one: or put on a softer stricture of stricture somewhat, according to what preceded the memory of it at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let there be cloths that envelop the fracture, soft, wet: and not hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let there be a thread that is tied up with linen its own, between the thin and the thick, as we have described.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and the ligaments after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	That if anything should happen which requires a correction, such as itching that happens to a limb: then let the member be immersed in warm water, until that itch is quiet, and remove the member not constricted, until it is quiet, and then repeat the stricture.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	That if the stricture has already been softened, and the bone has already been removed, and similar things: then correct all that with your virtue, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	If nutrition is forbidden to reach the limb because of excess tightness of the scar, then it is necessary that you make it soft a little and leave it for a few days until it heals, and then bind it tightly.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if none of what we have said happens to the sick person, then it is not necessary that he be cured unless after twenty days or so.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the patient's hand should be hung on his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And the patient's neck should be kept level, and he should be guarded with his own strength from sudden movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And let him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days; and perhaps it is restored in fifty-six days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of this depends on the condition of the wound and the strength of the patient.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	On the restoration of fractures of the Hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XXII.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that it is rare for a fracture to occur in the palm or the knuckles of the fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And this does not happen to him unless he has a great deal of rough usage.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	But when a fracture or a sprain has occurred, then the sick person should sit on a chair with his back straight, and in front of him should be placed a second chair at the same level.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then put the patient' hand outstretched on it.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then let the physician extend the bones that are broken and make them equal, until such time as they join together well.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary that an ointment and a bandage be placed on it if there does not occur a feverish swelling.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place the splint from above on him according to the amount of space required; and you have already wrapped it with linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	But if the fracture is lower down around the root of the palm, then make a sphere-like shape out of linen cloth; and instruct the sick person to wrap his hand with it when he has a fracture; and then bind it tightly with the cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let it be placed on the skin, where it is soft, so that it adheres to the body of the plant: and bind it fast, as may be necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	But if the fracture is to the outside, then it is right: that you put one splint from above, and another splint from below in the plant: and let the hand be open straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then put on the splint, as the hand opens out: and spread it between the fingers with a bandage.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	That if any fracture should be to any of the knuckles of the fingers, then it is equal as to what is necessary: and if it is the thumb, so let it be.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then bind it with the plant: and if you love, then put a straight splint on it, so that the fracture may be held fast, and not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	But if the fracture is to any of the other fingers, as to the middle, or the index, or the auricular, or the annulary, then it is equal, and bound with the finger which follows it: or all be bound according to the continuation: and that is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or put a splint above it, as we have said in the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after that disposition apostematici heat: and oppose with it what is necessary, when anything happens of that, according to which its narrative returns.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	Of the restoration of the fracture of the hips.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often broken, and is felt by touch: because it turns towards the inner and back parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And the restoration of it is such that one ligature is bound above the fracture, and another below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the sick man shall stretch himself on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then let every ligature be extended to its side for equality: and this, when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	But if the fracture is near the root of the hip, then let there be a ligature on the side towards the pelvic bone, that it may bend upwards: and a ligature below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And so likewise if there is a fracture in the vicinity of the knee, then let him sit on the nearby ligament of the knee, so that he sits with an extension downward.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician shall adjust the bones of both hands until he has reduced them in accordance with the natural figure; and he shall join the bones together with a good joint.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary that you should put on plaster and bind it tightly, if this does not happen to the member by aphemia.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	That if it should happen to him by aphemia: then dismiss him for a few days, until the heat subsides; and then return to your healing.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	But let the bandaging be such as
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary that you should wrap up firmly over the fracture, that is, bind it: and double it twice, or three times; and leave off from it what is superfluous.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap up the leg, until it has grown to the root of the bone.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the coxal bone and the leg near the knee joint downward, and make the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two limbs.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then wrap up firmly over the leg and the coxal bone what is superfluous from the sash.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then put on top of the coxal bone, at the place of the fracture, the wooden slats; and put out of them one wooden slat over the bone of the thigh.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill with plasters between the leg and the coxal bone with soft rags, so that the bandaging is even.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with the strong bandage from the middle at the place of the fracture three times, or four times.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the longer you extend it with the ligament from the place of the fracture, the less and softer, and softer will be your bandaging.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then introduce the thread at both ends, which you have inserted between the coxal bone and the leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Bind on then with the three wooden slats that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then move the two ends of the thread downward, until you reach the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And when you have bound both ends of the wooden slats on either side as well: so that the bandage does not move from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then release the ligature upon it while it remains, so that there be no corruption of the member, nor aphthae, nor swelling, and such things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything should happen from it.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Then with the solution put on it, and straighten out what has happened there completely, as we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	But if a fragment of bone should strike the bone: then it is necessary that you make it even, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find on it, and move it: and take care with it, that there be remembrance of the one who preceded it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture of the hip is tightened, except that they are added to it pegs, as we have said in the arm and wrist.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	But in restoring it so that the fracture is not there, there is no limp.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, except that another leg is applied to him, then he must always limp who has the one which is restored.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And you should know that the hip is tightened in fifty days, or a little is added to it, or a little is worn away: all of this is according to the variation of the complexion, and the remaining dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Regarding the restoration of the fracture of the knee joint of the leg.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You should know that the fracture of the knee joint of the leg rarely happens, but it often happens to him that he is worn away.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	But if a fracture has happened to him, then there is either a crack, or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is with the ulna, and without the ulna.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And he will stand on it all with a sense of measure.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And the restoration of it is so that it adjusts what has been broken from its parts with fingers, until it comes together, and joins together according to what is possible from equitation and ease, and manufacture.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then put on plaster from fine flour, or grind it with egg white: and put on a round peg above it, if you can bear that one: and tighten very well with a fitting to it.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the arrangements which we have mentioned in the remaining fractures: such as the swelling of heat, and others like that: so that you oppose to every accident with what is appropriate to it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	The restoration of a fractured limb
Caput XVII.	Head XVII
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You should know that there are two bones in the limb, one is thick and called "Crurus" by name, and the other is thin and called "Focile" by name.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both species of fracture that occurs in the two bones of the arm: and because of this, its restoration is made as restoration of the equal arm, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones break at once, the limb becomes disabled in all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the thin bone breaks, the limb is disabled on its front side.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thick bone breaks, it injures what is below it: and is of those which do not hide from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, equalization, and binding of the joints according to the equality thereof.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the limb is a bad fracture, it has many complications: so that its extension is smaller, and less painful to you.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the limb itself is from the operation something on the arm: and it is, as when you equalize the joints, and perform all your operation, then take two strips of pine wood, which is administered in the fabrication of sockets that are placed under the tables: and they are made from palm leaves: and choose from them which have little thickness, and there are none of the small ones: and let be the length of them according to the length of the limb from the knee down.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap it up on one sheet of cloth, twice, according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one side of the limb from one side, and the other from another side: and let be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind the two strips in three places from the two extremes and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For since constriction is prohibited, the knife tilts towards the right and left, and remains in good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And indeed the cuna-board is to be set from wood according to the length of the thigh, and placed therein so that it may preserve itself from motion.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And indeed you must do this much, that you make the break when it is a proper fracture.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the thigh day by day, and with great care watch it carefully for any swelling, or inflammation, or anything else.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	But if anything happens to it, then oppose it to it as much as is needed until it heals, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of the fracture of the bones of the foot and the fingers.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	The heel bone does not have a fracture in the center.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	But the bones of the foot do happen sometimes when there is a fracture, and the fingers also happen sometimes when there is a fracture; but they do not happen to them unless it is from overuse in many situations.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If it happens to the bones of the foot and you see those bones slip over each other when you walk, then let the sick person put his or her foot on the ground prepared, like a walker.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand you, and place your foot on that which lifts itself from those bones; then press, or trample it; and make it even, until it returns to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then put a splint on, and wrap it up; and place under the thigh a thin board which has two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then tighten it with a tight strap when you wrap it, and with anything else that is needed; and release it gradually as the leg gets better.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	But after three or four days have passed, then loosen the ligaments.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find bones that are even, or if they are fractured, or out of place.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	Then the operation on them is as follows, as you see it.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if some of the fingers are broken, then restore them, and make even the others according to what I have told you in the restoration of finger bones of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then take your finger and make a splint according to the length of that finger, and make it wide enough: then place this plate under the foot as I told you, and tighten it well.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If, however, what is broken is made up of two or three or more bones, then place a splint over the whole length of the finger, wrapped in a linen cloth: and fasten the plate to the foot below: and let it stand on one head of the table outside the navel of the foot, so that it holds well with retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it will be for you to remember, so that you do not forget, all that I have told you about the other broken bones from the accidents which we mentioned: and oppose every accident with it as much as is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Regarding the fracture of a woman's pelvis, and of the ribs, and of a man's thigh-bone.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the pelvic bone is broken, then make her sit square.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then lean her back a little towards the side of her spine, and let her be held from behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then fill the woman' pelvis with cotton until she is filled: and let her be made round in the pelvis from that.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman should be raised, and her back should be raised little by little.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For this cotton will come out, until it is in front of the woman' door like a ball, and the broken jaw will return.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a little pillow on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	But when she wants to urinate, the cotton will move easily with ease, and then she will urinate: and reduce it according to the way in which you put it in at first: and then bring it back to her little pillow again.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let it be for seven days, or about, for the jaw itself will be restored: for this bone itself will be healed.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a piece of oak, and make it go through a hole with an awl, and put the whole oak into her pelvis.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with power, until the vessel bends within the cavity, for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then fill it with cotton, and let it stand a few days, as we have told, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the chest breaks for a man or woman, then administer to it what we have related in the restoration and adjustment of that which we have told concerning the bone of the breast.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And let not the rectum be hidden in those who are near to fracture, which happen little, especially if it is a certain study or use.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book very well, for the fracture itself means to you in many dispositions a straight course in the restoration of its own and a constriction of it: therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But when the rod of a man breaks, take the throat of a goose: and introduce the virgate into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then put over him the wrapping of a cloth, and let it be wrapped up, and leave for three days, or about them, and he shall be healed, if God so will.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	De restoration of fractures of bones, when it is with the arm.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is fitting that he who has suffered a fracture with an injury, especially if it is great, such as the hip bone, or supporting bones, or similar to it, as you please, and let him stand immediately: if the conditions of phlebotomy are attested to you, such as we have mentioned.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	That if the arm spurts blood, then it is necessary, as you please, to the dissection of it, so that it becomes powder on the top of it: if there is not present to you another.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture in that very day: and do not put off that which has been told, unless there is an apoplexy.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	But if there happens to be a hot apoplexy, then dismiss the restoration of it until the ninth day, until it subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach him on the third and fourth days at all, for you would make bad accidents happen to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin: then it is necessary for you to attempt to reduce this yourself, and make it equal with your hands with ease and a small extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	But if the extension of it is not prepared, and its equality with your hands: then reduce this itself with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And this instrument is made of iron, the length of which is the quantity of seven fingers, or eight; and its width is according to the quantity of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And because of this it is necessary for the doctor to take from them three, or four according to the quantity that he needs for the healing of all kinds of fractures.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And it should be round: and it should have a small thickness so that it does not double up under pressure on the top of it during the operation: and it should have an acute end at its ends, which has a edge at its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let it be above its thickness from the middle of it to the bottom.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation, that the end of it be placed with a curved edge on top of the prominent end of the bone: and push it forward with a single force, until the bone returns and becomes equal with a certain equality.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	So then take care to make the ends of the fracture face each other at right angles.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	But if the ends of it are fragile, and does not take it by good purchase: then it is necessary for you, so that you can hit the end of its bone, until this instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	But if you cannot reduce these with the instrument which we have mentioned at all, then strike it with one of the saws which we have spoken of: or saw it with a single saw in any way which is possible for you to do.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then file away what remains on the bone from sharpness and small splinters.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	But when the bone has been reduced and finds a painful and distressing aching after its reduction, then you should know that the bone has not returned to its own place.
Fac ergo illud.	I shall therefore translate this.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you have a great power of healing when your own bone is restored as you do it.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then dip the cloth in vinegar, black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is in the summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place any oil on the bone, nor anything else that might cause it to rot and腐烂。
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer the blood in your hour of restoration from the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And let the broken bone go: so that you may fall with a snap when the threads are loosened according to the quantity of injury.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And take all care, do not tie the bone with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many times have the stoics made this mistake of tying a fracture bone: and they have caused to happen to their own infirmities or death, or corruption, or putrefaction, that is, rot.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And may your own ligament be soft, gentle, very different from the stiffness of the fractured ligaments.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	For if the bone is bad, or is a large bone, and you should bear some accident that we have described, and suspend pain in the place: then it is not necessary to tie bones to the bone.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make them solutions from dry cloths in the place of the bones, and tie the bone with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When it is after one day, or two days, and you see the bone has already begun to produce pus, then remove the cloth that you have placed on the bone with vinegar.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer leech, and ointments with which we are accustomed from our tradition to heal wounds, such as the tetrapharmacon ointment, and others like it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And may it be convenient to you, that you break the ligaments.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the bone every day morning and evening until it is healed, and cured。
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it should be prepared for the limb in such a way that pus may flow out of it easily from below.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	For if the wounds have passed many days, and are not healed, and no pus flows from them: then you shall know that there are little bones in it.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	How you should ask about the fracture with the tent.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How much of those broken bones are separated, remove them, and pull out themselves.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And which of those bones are not separated, and when they pierce the limb, and cause pain, avoid causing it, and remove it in any way possible for you that injury.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	That if it happens to the patient that he is sore, or ekileten, namely, estiomenus, or any other kind of corruption and putrefaction: then you should oppose each one of them with what suits him in healing, whose preceding narrative is in his chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from that in which it is necessary that my speech should stand, and to which you shall direct your attention when the jaw is broken, and comes out above the limb, like the hip bone, and the auxiliaries, and such things from the large limbs, that is, so that you do not suspect attraction from it, for often happens from that death, besides leave it until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps indeed it will fall by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then therefore heal the fracture if you can, and otherwise leave it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the Treatment of Knots in a Wound Frature.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This treatment has often occurred in a wound on the healing of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially, that which is near joints: and it nourishes from that figure of the member.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps prohibits the member from its natural action.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Then consider, if that treatment is new: administer to it medicines which have a tightening effect, such as aloe, and olive oil, and myrrh, and lead-ore, and acacia, and similar things.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So, that you take from these some, or all of them: and apply them with astringent wine, or with egg-yolk, or with vinegar: and place them on the treatment in a crucible, and tighten them with good compression.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And send away the bandage, and do not take it off for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then untie it, and tie on another, until the swelling goes down.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or fasten over it a leaden plate askew.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead is the property that removes from the body anything feared.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the swelling has already set into the stone, and is rigid, and the need to remove it is urgent, then find on its upper part and cut off the prominence: or else saw it off with some chisel, until the swelling goes away: and take care of it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	As for the curing, when it is restored, and remains a member after that, not according to its natural form.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When the fracture of a bone is restored, and remains a member after that, feeble: then it is not done for no reason at all.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Of which one is that the multitude of the solution and the ligation of its ligaments is not according to what is required: or because of the excess of the bandage, until it is prevented from running food into the member: or because of the multiplicity of the unguents superfluous in not their time: or because of the scarcity of blood in the body, and the weakness of it.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And its curing is, to feed the sick, and to make the body of it strong, until there is an increase of blood in it.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and gladness over it.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then put a pin on the member: to attract the pin towards it for much food.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And apply to it with frequentness the unguents with hot water, until it runs out for food, and returns to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	As for the curing of broken bones when they are restored, if they are twisted.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens to a member that is restored after its curing, and there is a prominence of the bone, or swelling: and feeding it in the form of the member does not prohibit its natural function: then you should not take issue with it, that it will break again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there were also many stupid doctors and surgeons who did that work on our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is truly terrible, leading to death or a great fear, as it may be mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the limp and sway are recent: then it should be soaked with warm water in which the soothing herbs have been boiled, such as the leaves of mullein, and the root of its kind, and the melon seed, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let there be made for him a poultice with a soothing plaster, such as that made from dyachil, prepared in the opposite way.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or let the root of mullein be boiled with chicken fat or sise oil, and let it be applied with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or let the young fig branches be taken, and boiled with fennel seed, and similar herbs that are called to decrease consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when the sway has abated with diligent, old, and gentle massage, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And let the members of the body be moved in all directions during all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the stiffness has already preceded and it is a strong one, which is turned into a rock, and an occasion has been caused to treat it with iron: then let the upper part of it be cut away, and the continuity of the bone be made whole, and what is superfluous from the stiffness or the bone with subtle incisions be removed, and ease be given to it with care and effort.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On the topic of Dislocation:
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of some joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Why it is restrained from its own motion, and is supported by the figure of the member.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes pain to the sick, and painful wounds.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When, then, dislocation occurs in anyone, let him hurry to repair it: and let him not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if he delays it, the joint will stiffen, and with it the dislocation may be reduced.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	For this reason, then, it is not fitting that he should stir or stretch himself out at the hour of his examination.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For indeed he often causes a spasm to occur, and pains that hurt.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that does happen, then you should, as it were, approach the bleeding of the wound.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let him be dismissed, until he is at rest from the seizure.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then let the member be moistened with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then let it be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And let all the limbs be cared for with that which comes to its own place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have already ordered the chapters on dislocations, also according to what preceded it in fracture, from the upper part of the body down to the lower part thereof.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	§ On the care of the dislocation of the jaw (mandible).
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	A little dislocated are the two jaws unless rarely.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of the jaw is made in one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or indeed they remove themselves from their places with a little remote, and slightly soften.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or indeed they are dislocated with an entire, complete dislocation until they soften toward the breast, until the salivation of the wound happens, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and licks his tongue with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When indeed its dislocation is little, then it returns of itself in many positions with a little ease.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	But if indeed the dislocation is complete, entire: then let it be administered the reduction of it promptly, and do not delay underduringly: and it is, as it were, to hold the head in care: and let the doctor insert his thumb of his hand upon the dislocation between his mouth, if the dislocation is from one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or indeed let two thumbs be inserted simultaneously, if the dislocation is from two sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the other fingers of his hand are set outside, which make even.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And command the sick person to clean his jaws, and to free them for chewing on all sides.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And let the doctor open his mouth wide, and push back the teeth, until it has returned to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	That if it is difficult to reduce it, especially if both jaws are involved: then administer steam with hot water and oil until it becomes easy to reduce the bars; and do not delay reducing the bars at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When therefore they are reduced and become even, and the mouth is closed, and do not soften: then place on them cotton rags, with a wax that has been made; and oil of roses.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then bind it together easily with soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the patient lie on his back: and his head be held between two cotton rags so that he does not move to one side or the other: nor is it bothered, or forced to chew anything: but rather let him have a soft diet, until such time as he can open his jaw; then let him eat whatever he wants, and give it to him easily.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Do not let him struggle with the operation of his mouth during eating and drinking, and whistling, until such time as the jaw has healed, and it is well.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	That if it is difficult to reduce the two jaws when they are dislocated at some time and do not return to their places: then frequently there occur from it fevers, and sodas; and perhaps it dissolves the stomach of the sick, and perhaps it leaves pure cholesterol.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When therefore you see this: then know that it is a death sentence, and often he dies who experiences this within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	Regarding the reduction of dislocation of the fork (furcula) and the extreme of the arm.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26: On the Head.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The furcula does not dislocate from the side due to the continuation of its connection with the breastbone.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it dislocates sometimes towards the outside: and reveals itself to the sense.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And his recovery is that he should lie on his back and extend his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then wrap the place with your palm firmly, for it will come back.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then put a plaster on it, and wool, and tighten it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities of him who is lying down, and continue with him, do not dislocate, except rarely.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	That which dislocates on a certain day: then it is necessary that you reduce and adjust it according to what we said, and that it is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put a plaster on it, and wool, and tighten it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And order the sick person to adhere to peace and quietness until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same cure, the extremity of the humerus is reduced when it separates also from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	De reductione dislocationis humeri:
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	You know that the shoulder does not dislocate unless by three methods.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	Of which one is that it dislocates towards the tickling part towards the lower side.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	Second, is that it dislocates towards the chest side.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it dislocates towards the upper part of the humerus; and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And does not dislocate towards the back, due to the spatula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And does not dislocate towards the front, due to the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And most certainly dislocates and moves towards the lower side towards the tickling part; especially in those who have little flesh there.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Since it moves quickly out of them, and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those who have a lot of flesh, it is the opposite, that is, because it moves out with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps happens to some people, a blow or a fall, and the humerus is dislocated by heat, and it is thought because of that, since it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	It is necessary so that you should experience that, until you are certain about its state, and then proceed to its cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And the dislocation is recognized when it is directed downward towards the nipple: and distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy shoulder.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will see between them a great difference, and the dislocation of the head of the humerus has come together with it, and under the nipple there is a head of the humerus as if it were one itself: and an unhealthy person cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all its movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And in the same way, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upward: then there is a clear sensation of touch and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And of this kind of dislocation the reduction is easy when it is recent, or when the person is a child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is such that it raises its own hand towards the sky.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then put your fingers under its nipple and open the reduction with strength upward to its place: and he will raise his own hand and extend it upward.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then let him put it down, for himself he will quickly recover.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	But if he does not recover by means of what we have said, and there are many days from the time when the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary that the sick person bath in warm water, and be given a poultice which softens and soothes, such as if it were cooked alfalfa roots, and fenugreek, and melilot in water, and be applied.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then let the sick person lie on his back: and let there be placed under its nipple a sphere and wool, which is equal to the length and width of the relief.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then let the doctor put his heel on top of the sphere, and raise with strength the head of the humerus, and draw the sick person's hand downward by its side.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another person shall hold the sick person's head so that it does not move downward: for he will quickly recover.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him by this method: for it is such that the present man who is taller than the sick one shall stand by his side, and put his shoulder under the sick person' nipple: and raise the latter' nipple upward, until the sick person hangs in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another minister takes the hand of the patient from below his knee.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	But if the injured person is weak then it should be so that something else is suspended with him, to prevent him from falling over: for displacement returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced in another way: and this is that it should be so that a long piece of wood is placed on the ground, whose head is round: like a mortar's sleeve: it should not be thick or fine.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then place under the sick person a soft cloth after they are placed on top of the wood's head: and let the sick person stand in line with the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand is extended from the other side to the lower part of his body, and his body is extended from one side with strength: for the union returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	That if his reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this care: and this is that you take a piece of wood whose length is the amount of two arms, and its width is the amount of four fingers, and its thickness is the amount of two fingers: and its head should be round, to relieve its entrance into the deep crack, according to this shape.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths are tied over the round head so that they do not harm the wood to the sick person.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then place under the crack a nurse who should extend his hand or arm over the wood to the lower part: and tie the wood on the support and arm and limb of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then place an arm over the ladder's step by its width, and extend his hand to the lower part, and dismiss the rest of the body suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the union enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	But when his entrance is complete in any way possible: then it should be so that you place under the crack a sphere of the same amount of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place an emollient made from pounded rose with olive oil and white powdery substance over the whole shoulder, as it rotates upwards from above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tie the tourniquet above the pulse: and turn around the ligament over the poultice above: and attach his hand to his own neck, and let it go, and do not move his hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that food be given to the sick person in small amounts until his member is healed: for it is more speedy to his healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then after seven or five days, let him exercise with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	But if it does not soften and tighten, then he is now healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	But if the joint dislocates often, because of the moisture that occurs with it, or because of another cause: then it is necessary that he be administered a cauldron with six holes, as has been said in the chapter on the cauldron.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	What if all this is done, and the ligament is released after seven days, and the joint does not tighten, and the poultice and constriction above him are relaxed a little, and does not harden, and falls down, and cannot raise himself upwards: then you should know that the nerves which are in the shoulder have been cut, or stretched out, or softened. And you should know that the joint never establishes itself in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	But the dislocation which occurs toward the chest and the nipple, or the reduction towards the back, takes place with an impact and extension with the hands: until it returns, and a remaining constriction and care is administered to it, until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	What if weight occurs after healing in the member, and slowness in its movement: then the sick person should take many baths, until that weight is softened, and he returns to his own nature first.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the Healing of Dislocation of the Elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You should know that the joint of the elbow dislocates with difficulty, and also heals with difficulty; and it itself dislocates to all sides, and especially to the front or back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And his dislocation does not remain hidden from you; for it is falling under the sight and under the touch, according to whichever figure it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated bed with the sound one, that is declared to you manifestly.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint is twisted, and it cannot double the arm, nor can it touch with its shoulder.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you should do so that you restore the dislocation immediately, before a fever seizes him.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a fever seizes him, his reduction is difficult; and perhaps he does not recover at all, especially when it is behind.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse in all forms of dislocation, and more painful to him; and often he dies with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it when it is out of those things that can be reduced, is that he extends his hand with both hands; and his arm is spread wide, and his medial fingers are above the bed and under it, and he pushes back the dislocation with his thumb-tips or with the root of his palm, until he brings it back to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or the dislocation is to the front; then he returns so that he doubles his hand with his own, until he hits against the root of his palm with the bed which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	Which if it does not obey the reduction, then administer a painful extension, strongly; and it is as if two ministers extend his arm: and they hold him also so that he does not move at all during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then his arm turns back to all parts after it has been wrapt around his hand with a long piece of cloth, or a wide ligament.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches his joint with his own hand, he smears it with oil: so that it is out of those things that assist in the lubricity of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he pushes back the dislocation with a forceful impulse, until he brings it back.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after the reduction of it, let there be placed on it a plaster, in which is stiptitude, and drying with white of egg, and let it be tightened by tightening as it goes down.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And let the arm be suspended from the neck of the nurse; and let it be discharged after a few days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then let it be unbound.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	But if the joint remains firm in its own place, then loosen the ligament from it, and discharge it itself.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see that the joint is not well bound, then apply plaster again, and the ligament, and discharge it after a few days, until it is bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then let it be unbound.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	But if he has put on weight after the joint has been reduced and it is still moving: then administer humidity in a bath, and a slight friction, and compression, until it heals, or put a poultice on the joint, that is, natrum arietis pinguem.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then bind it up, and discharge it over it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then take it off, and put the patient into a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	But when he sweats, then bind the joint with a slight friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then apply the poultice one time on each side of the joint in entering the bath, twice more, and then a third time with the exit from the bath, until it becomes soft.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if there is a wound, put on it clay that is damp, warm with butter, and bind firmly over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Perform this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For it will heal, and return to its own place.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	The treatment of the dislocation of Albucasis.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	When the hand is greatly displaced, that is, a joint between the arm and the hand is dislocated.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	But the other joints are relined.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it should be so that the speed of its reduction from dislocation is at the time when the latter is dislocated, or that it happens while it is warm.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of its dislocation is this way, so that you put Mahassem's hand, which is weak, on a table, and let it extend its finger, and let the doctor put his palm on the eminence of the joint, and push it, until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manos suae super tabula apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manos, tunc sit positiones manos eius intrinsece super tabula, id est, interior pars mano eius super tabula ponatur, ut cadat mano medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	Indeed, it should be considered if the palm has already receded to the abdominal region of the hand: then place the patient's hand on a table with extension and reduction: and if dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then position the hand of the patient intrusively over the table, that is, the interior part of his hand over the table is placed so that the doctor's hand falls over that eminence of the joint.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manos, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi aut attriti.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	Cum ergo non redit Albucasis, tunc pone super ipsum emplastra, quod narrauimus.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitatior manos.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidit in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc lene eam cum aqua calde, et frequentia frigore, donec leniatur.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	De cure dislocationis articulorum digitarum libet ut super illa praescribere moerimus.
Caput XXX.	De cure dislocationis articulorum digitarum libet ut super illa praescribere possimus. Caput XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	Quando dislocatur ex eis digitus ad omnem partem, vel ex eis digitis ad dorsum palmae, aut ad ventrem eius: tunc extendite digitum, et impellite dislocationem pollicibus vos, donec redeat.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the digit and hang it from the side where it is dislocated for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then hang it and stretch it until it is even in that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When night comes on then bind him according to the above-mentioned description: and do not stop to loosen him in that day: and exercise him with movement: and bind him at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Perform these days a few times, until it is taut.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And also do this with him, if the dislocation is towards the thumb: and bind it to the side, and perform your first operation on it, until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And also do this with him when dislocated towards the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	The cure for back dislocations:
Caput XXXI.	Head 31:
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When a person has a complete dislocation of the spine or many vertebrae have moved from their positions then there is no cure for this illness because death looms over the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the sick person walks with a limp without wanting to, and cannot hold himself steady: and many of his limbs weaken a little, or two of his limbs, or two of his arms, or one of them; or a vertebra moves out of place from its position.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For many times a vertebra can move if it is moved too much, and these move to the four sides.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	So the one that moves backwards is called A hunch.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The cure for this disease is that you consider then if hunch comes on during adolescence: there is no cure for it, and there will be no healing from it at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in the one that comes on through age or injury or similar things, the ancient healers have long since taught methods of cure with many words.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of these many do not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I however have shortened this from its origin, which would not excuse much of the length of his close relationship with mine towards intention: and my exposure of it when I showed it, and I formed an instrument of many ways to show him, and they displayed it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say then that in a hunchback which occurs from the anterior part, there is no skill or cure from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And likewise in that which happens to the two sides.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And should not be cured from them, unless that which happens in the back proper, with what I tell you now: and it is, so that the sick person lies on his face on a level platform close to the wall: and he spreads under him a damp cloth, so that his chest does not hurt.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight piece of wood should be placed in the foot of the bed, near the head of it: and another piece of wood should be held around the feet on the other side of the bed: and the minister should hold the wood, and not let it rest on the ground.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And the other minister should hold the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then the nurse shall bend over his head and under his chin with a soft band, fastening it firmly: and she shall extend the end of the band to the wood which is near his head: and she shall bind herself in it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then another band should be tightened above his shoulders and above his knees, and near his ribs.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then all the bands should be gathered together and bound in the other wood which is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then the other minister should extend to the side of the wood the bands which are not fixed in their places: however, they should not be fixed, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the doctor should place his palms on the spine with firmness, until he has turned it round: or he should place them on the board.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he shall set his feet on the board, until he has turned it round.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	But if he does not turn by this cure, then take a board whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And make a hole in the wall from which we speak, which is near the sick person, a place into which the end of the board shall go.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then put the middle of the board on the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the doctor put his feet on his own sides at the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And he should tie it well, until the spine is tightened, and return to his place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you want to operate with a tourniquet that is wrapped with your hand: and it is, so as to fix in the ground near the head of the patient two sticks, whose length sits in the length of one arm: and apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And the length that is between all stick pommel one: and it has been done in every place hole, where the tourniquet runs: and all wood hardens in the ground a lot, so as not to move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And the round stick is inserted: and the tourniquet is in which the ligament revolves in two holes of two sticks.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the end thereof is a hole, in which the wood is fixed, whose length is with it that revolves: and on the other two sticks is also the same.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tie the ligaments that you tied inside the patient's abdomen with a tourniquet that is at his head: and the ligaments that you tied in his legs with a tourniquet that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand next to every tourniquet, who twists his hand with a tourniquet, with which the tourniquet revolves: and the doctor equit Spondilem, according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the tourniquet that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after Spondilis has returned and his place has been equalized, then it is necessary to put dried blood clumps with albumin.
Deinde stuppam.	Then stand up.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then put a board above the clumps of blood, whose width is three fingers wide, or around them.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is the quantity that takes the place of the gibbosity, and on the side of a healthy spine.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then tie it with a ligament that we have said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And use it to feed the sick with subtle food until they heal.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If something remains of excellence in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that those be administered which are softening and relaxing, with the administration of the tablet which we described at a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And already it is being administered in that leaden plate.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when something of excellence happens at the end of the spine of the back: and it is thought through that dislocation, and it is that bone which has already come out.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Why should not presumption be made with this medicine: perhaps, however, it will happen to cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	[On the Treatment of a Dislocated Ankle.]
Caput XXXII.	CHAPTER XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that the ligaments of the ankle, and of the shoulder, do not occur, except when there is a dislocation; and they do not occur in them because of a small distance from each other, and due to friction.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the ligaments of the ankle dislocate according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Because it dislocates towards the front and towards the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And much more it dislocates towards the inside; and little towards the front, and towards the back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of its dislocation towards the inside is this: because when you join the injured leg with a healthy one, it is longer; and the knee of the injured is more prominent than that of the healthy, and the sick cannot double his foot there by virtue of the warm spot which follows the hip.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of that for which dislocation has occurred towards the outside is this: its opposite accidents to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of that for which dislocation has occurred towards the front is this: it expands the healthy leg according to its complement; however, it does not double itself without pain in the knee: and if he attempts to walk, he cannot go forward on it on the front side: and he retains his urine, and follows his hip with it, and during walking he stumbles on his heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of him in whom dislocation has occurred to the rear is that his knee does not bend before he bends both knees, and the bone of his leg is also shorter on one side: and the knee is softened, and the head of the femur is at the place of the hip.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction, however, of this dislocation can be seen when you consider that if the dislocation is recent, it will have healed by the time it has been held in place.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then, if you administer the reduction and it remains in the same position: there is then no cure at all for it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore it should not be assumed that he has a complete recovery.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In that person, however, whose dislocation is recent and who has only one of the four types of dislocation: then approach this, so that you can move it, and extend it towards the inside and outside, and move it with your right and left hand: for it may well recover, and it will not require any further treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If, however, he does not recover in this way, then you must prepare a strong remedy, and extend his leg from the lower part: or with his hands, or with a ligament that is tied above his leg; and another assistant should extend his hand under its heel so that he can place his hands under the heel of his foot.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then tie it with a soft ligament at the root of the hip, and hold the end of the other ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let him sit with his extension either from the front part of the groin to the hip, or from the back to the spine.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let all these extensions move in one direction at first, until he raises himself with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	This type of extension is a common feature of the four types of dislocation.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If this dislocation is reduced with that which I have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to say of each species what I say about its own cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Indeed, when the dislocation is towards the inside, it is necessary that the weak one should lie on his sound side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then put the ligament over the root of the hip, since it is between the head of the hip and the place that is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligament from the side of the groin to the higher part of the body, to the side of the fork.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong minister should take his arms, and he should make the place of the weak hip small, and he should extend it to the outside with a violent extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For he has already returned to his place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this kind of treatment is easier than the other kinds of treatment for this member when it is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	But if it refuses to comply with you at all when you treat it with this kind of treatment: then two nurses should be tied down together with a strong ligament, mild, over the two heels, and over the two knees: and let the length of each from its own starting point be the same as that of four fingers: and let the calf of the infirm person be extended by two fingers' width more than the other.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then hang up the infirm one on the head of the ligament, which is in the house: and let the length of him from the ground be the same as that of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then order a strong youth to support the head of the hip: and let another hang with the infirm one: and let another push him from behind, supporting the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	But in reducing his own, when the dislocation is towards the outside, it should be laid that the infirm one lies on the ground, following which we have spoken about having a hunchback.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And tie the ligament over his leg, infirm in itself, and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two stakes should be put, one at his feet, and another at the head of him.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then put the wood added into the middle of his heel, fixed well: and let there be placed over it wet cloths so that they do not hurt the infirm one: and let the wood be between his hips, so that it does not draw towards the lower ones with the extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then all the attendants should spread out to their respective areas, and the doctor should give a careful reduction by hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If he obeys in the reversion, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, put a board on it, and press it, as we have said in the case of a hunchback, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the sick man lie on his sound side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is in the front, then it should be extended quickly the leg of the nurse: and it is according to this that we tell about the platform: and the doctor puts his hand by his right hand on the hip of the sick person.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he should grasp him with the other hand, and with that grasp place him extended towards the lower side of the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is at the back: then it is not necessary that the sick person be extended towards the lower part, and let him sit raised on the ground: but it is necessary that he be placed on a hard thing, as it should also be if his pelvis were dislocated to the outside, according to what we have said about his lying on two backs: and it is on his face, and the extensions of the ligaments: according to what we have said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that compression be applied with a board even to the place from which the slip occurs, when reduction has been completed according to what should be done.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of his recovery should not be hidden from you: and it is as if you extend the two legs of the nurse: and when you see them equal, and the sick person tightens his own leg, and stretches himself without excuse: then you know that the member has recovered, according to what is necessary: then join the two hips together, and put a bandage on, and tighten it with the rope, that is, rotate it: so that it does not move the pelvis towards any parts: and let him adhere quietly for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then undo the ligaments, and the bandage, and bring together the legs with each other: then if you see them equal in state, then you know that the dislocation has now been fixed: so let the sick person go, to walk about.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see anything of healing: then return, and bind it, and tighten it according to your first rule: and also let it be for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then حلّه واجعله يتأخر في المشي على جانبين لعدة أيام، حتى يبرأ جيداً.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	(On the Dislocation of the Knee.)
Caput XXXIII.	¶ De motu rotatorio et de luxatione articulorum.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	(On the Rotational Movement and Luxation of Joints.) The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	(Is dislocated outward, inward, and downward, namely to the rear.)
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	(And is not dislocated in front.)
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	(And the sign of its dislocation is that he who is sickly should apply his leg to his hip.)
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	(If it does not adhere to the hip: then you shall know that the knee is dislocated.)
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	(And the restoration of all the modes of dislocation is so that you may make the sick sit upright, in such a way that he may extend his leg over it if he can, and fasten his back to his face: and place his foot between your feet.)
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	(Then fasten the knee of him with your palms, and make them straight between your fingers over his knee.)
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	(Then apply your two palms to both sides of his knee with strength.)
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	(And another person should extend his foot, until the knee returns to its place.)
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	(And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the hip with slowness, not painfully.)
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	(Then bind him up, and fasten his leg to his hip.)
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	(Then bandage them together with linen for three days or four.)
Deinde solue ea.	(Then solve them.)
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	(And let the sick person not walk for several days until he is healed.)
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	(If, however, it does not submit to your reduction, then administer a strong extension with the ligaments, of which there was a previous account in the cure of aching joints, until it returns.)
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	¶ On the treatment of a dislocated heel bone.
Caput XXXIIII.	De cure dislocatim calcanem.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	When the calcaneus is sometimes moved with a small movement, and when it is dislocated according to the complement.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And this dislocation of his is, or towards the insides, or towards the outsides.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of this dislocation is, that you see the calcaneus swollen, projecting towards the side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	But the treatment of this removal is, that it is easily reduced: and it is, so that it is extended with ease with the hands, and is made even, until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	But in the treatment of this when it is dislocated according to the complement, you should make the sick one sit upright: and let him hold himself by a strong hand firmly from the back part of his spine, in the middle of his own.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold him with your right hand on the upper part of his foot, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot, where the claw is.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull his foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with two fingers of your left hand.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with the left, and push the chest of the foot with the right towards the thigh without working.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice, as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the chest of the foot towards the thigh with a third force, and you draw the claw out.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If then he returns in a single or second force, and you see the foot even, it is good: but if not, then repeat the operation over him: for he will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if it is forbidden to you to reduce him with that which we have said: then let the sick one lie on his back on the ground, and fasten a smooth peg firmly in the ground, so that it may fall between his thighs: and you will now raise over him the cloth, so that he may not be hurt.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the minister take the sick one's foot: then extend the other minister's foot, or with his hands, or with a band that ties over the foot's collar.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let every servant stand opposite to the extension of his own body; and let a nurse stand between the two hips holding him back, so that his body is not drawn down towards the lower part at the time of extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the doctor shall make the servant's hands meet, and another servant shall hold the healthy leg from below.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore the dislocation has returned, and when you have told me about its return in health; then put on a splint and a support, and tie it with ligaments tightly, and bind the foot with a ligament to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you should beware and do not fear the nerves which are above the heel behind, lest there be a ligament over them that hurts them; and they hurt them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let him go free for two days or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	That if the ligament softens, tie him up; and then dissolve him on the third or fourth day; and forbid the sick one from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	But if he should try to walk before that space has passed, there is no security except that the dislocation be dissolved upon him, and that it be corrupted, and that he not receive after it any cure.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	That if it should happen to him that he has a feverish swelling: then let you administer to him in a sedative that which we have related in another place of the cure, and an ointment, until it subsides.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	On the Dislocation of the toes of the foot and its cure.
Caput XXXV.	CHAPTER XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that he should be made to extend slightly without working; and that this is not difficult, it is even easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	But if the dislocation is in some of the joints of the heel of the foot: then let the sick person stand his foot on an equal place of the ground, or on a board; and he shall walk as if standing.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you shall stand still, and let your foot be placed upon that which protrudes from the joint.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then that calcified bone with your foot with strength, until it returns, and the shape is now even, and does not appear in place eminence.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then put under his foot that plate which carries the whole foot, which has two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then tighten him with a bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then solve him, and let him rest from walking for many days, until he is tightened and secured from the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	On the type of dislocation with a ulna or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Head XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something like this happens to anyone, and he cares for his cure and restoration, many times death follows: and therefore it is not necessary for him to pride himself on the care of his wound, which is such, unless he is prudent in the art of long use, merciful, gentle, slow, not bold, and proud: and that he uses the medicines which sit upon the warm apostemes only: and lets go of the patient by divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you hope for salvation from destruction with gentleness of illness, and where there appears some hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore consider the reduction of him immediately at the beginning of the thing, before a warm aposteme happens to him.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	But if he returns the member, according to our order, then administer a regimen which sits upon the aposteme: and care for the ulna with him when it suits him out of the unguent of the desiccated.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	That if the dislocation is with a fracture, and things happen in the osses of the sagittal separation, then consider the removal of them, and make him in it what we said in simple illnesses from what preceded in their places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And bide according to your strength, and guard yourself from the entrance into a state of fear: according to which prophecy I told you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more enduring to your glory, and more safe to your body with them in your time.
