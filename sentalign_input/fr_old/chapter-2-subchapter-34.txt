Of cutting the frenulum of the tongue
Sometimes this ligament that comes from under the tongue is natural, as some are born this way; or it is from an accident of a healed wound; and the procedure is such that you open the patient's mouth, with his head in your lap, and lift the tongue; then cut the nervous ligament broadly, so that the tongue is freed from its attachment, and if there is hardness or a knot, and it is from the healing of a wound, then insert the hook and cut broadly that attachment; and ensure the incision is not too deep, because of the artery below; and when you are done, wash the area with rose water and plantain water, or with cold water, then place a linen tent under the tongue; and the patient should hold it every night, so the wound does not heal. And if bleeding occurs, apply powdered vitriol to the wound; and if the bleeding persists, cauterize it with a lentiginous cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with other remedies until it is healed,
