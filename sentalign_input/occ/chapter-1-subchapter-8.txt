Chapter Eight:
On the Cauterization of Memory Loss Caused by Phlegm
At the beginning, the patient should be given large jars and pills that cleanse the brain.
Then shave the patient's entire head and place a cedar plaster on the nape of the neck, as described in the treatise on plasters.
Apply it several times, as it acts in a similar manner to cauterization.
Do this according to the same order already described.
If the patient is healed by these methods, that is good; if not, then make three cauteries on the back of the head, descending from the uppermost part of the head to the lowest part of the neck.
Place the cauteries about a finger's width apart, and treat them with the previously mentioned remedies.
But if you want to add more and the patient can tolerate it, then make a cautery in the middle of the head; and if you want to add even more, then cauterize over the two horns.
Then treat the area until it is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped as previously described.
