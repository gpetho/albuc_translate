If you have treated a disease of the spleen with the treatments mentioned in the section on partitioning, and your treatment was not successful, cauterization is done in three ways, all of which are correct. One of them is to cauterize it three or four times in a row along the length of the spleen.	When you have treated disease of the spleen by the means that we have mentioned in the section and your treatment is ineffectual, there will be three ways of cauterization, each of which will be correct. One is to make three or four cauterizations in a row over the long axis of the spleen like the cauterization of the liver, a figure of which has been given above.	0.8882108
in the shape of the liver cauterizations, the form of which has been presented, with the space between each cauterization being the width of a finger or slightly more. The form of the cautery is the same as that mentioned for cauterizing the liver.  Do not insert your hand deeply with the cautery. The patient's position is lying on their back.	Let there be between each pair of burns a finger's breadth or a little more. Let the cautery be of the same shape as described above under cauterization of the liver. Do not put pressure on the cautery. Have the patient's body supine.	0.77593434
The other approach is at the elbow. You lift the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left elbow ends. Your lifting of the skin should be across the width of the body so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body.	The second method is to heat the cautery provided with two prongs, described in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder. Lift up the skin over the spleen at the level of the patient's left elbow; and let the fold of skin lie across the patient's body so that the cauterizations will fall longitudinally.	0.7675449
Then you insert the two skewers, very hot, until they penetrate the skin on the other side. Then you remove the cautery, making four cauterizations. If you wish, you can cauterize with the other cautery, which has three skewers.	Then push in the two prongs, well heated, till you have pierced the skin from side to side. Then take out the cautery; and there are four cauterizations. Or if you prefer you can burn with the other cautery, of three prongs.	0.88111496
Then treat the cauterization site after you leave it to drain pus for many days, as this is more effective than all the preceding treatments.	Then dress the site of cauterization after you have allowed pus to run therefrom for many days. This is more effective than any of the preceding treatments.	0.9132521
