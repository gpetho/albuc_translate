About rheum
When someone has an illness called "catarrh" in the eyes or chest, and the illness is chronic, and medical treatments do not help, then the last resort is cautery along with cutting the two arteries.
Therefore, when you want to cut them, have the patient tilt their head back; then rub the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient tightens their neck with a cloth; then observe where the veins pulse, and the locations of both are behind the ears, and they are slightly hidden; then mark the locations, and cut both with a sharp two-edged spatula, so that the cut reaches the bone, and this should be done across the width of the head.
And if you want, place the spatula under the artery and cut it from above, cutting as if two fingers width across.
And when the vein is cut, the blood will continuously spurt out upwards.
And if the artery does not appear by feeling, then you must measure the amount of three fingers width, then mark and cut to the bone; and the amount of blood that must be let out is six cups, possibly a little more or less, according to what the patient can bear, and the fullness of the artery; then look at the wound: if there remains a point on the bone, cut it so that a hot abscess does not form, then press the wound and bandage it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
