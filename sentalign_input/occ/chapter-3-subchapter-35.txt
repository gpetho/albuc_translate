Chapter 35.
On types of dislocation that occur with a wound or fracture or both together.
When any of these conditions occur, and you attempt to treat and restore it, often death ensues.
Therefore, only a skilled, experienced, merciful, and cautious practitioner, not rash or presumptuous, should attempt the treatment. Initially, use medicines that only alleviate painful abscesses and leave the patient to divine judgment, unless you have hope of recovery and alleviation of the disease, with some sign of hope.
Then try to reduce the dislocation immediately at the onset, before a painful abscess develops.
If the limb returns to place as desired, administer treatment to alleviate the abscess and heal the wound with appropriate drying ointments.
If the dislocation is accompanied by a fracture with separated bone fragments, stabilize them and proceed as described earlier for such conditions.
Protect and avoid exposure to hazards as much as possible, as advised earlier; this is better for you before your Creator, more lasting for your glory, and healthier for your body in the long run.
Thus concludes the words of Albucasim perfectly, for which God be praised.
Amen.
