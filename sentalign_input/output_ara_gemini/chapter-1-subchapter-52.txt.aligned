Chapter fifty-two on cauterizing the corroding ulcer.	CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO. On cauterization of gangrene.	0.7142911
The corroding ulcer is but a corruption that spreads in the organ, consuming it as fire consumes dry wood.	Gangrene is a creeping corruption of a limb, consuming it as fire consumes dry wood.	0.7482831
If you see the corroding ulcer in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, heat many nail-shaped cauteries, small and large, according to what is suitable for the place where the corroding ulcer is.	If you see gangrene in a part which can tolerate the actual cautery, heat a number of claviform cauteries, small or large to suit the site of the gangrene.	0.7131103
Then cauterize it from every side until all the corruption is eradicated and nothing of it remains at all.	Then cauterize it all over till the whole corruption is eradicated and none remains.	0.8970483
Then leave it for three days and apply powdered sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas until all the scab and all the corruption is removed.	Then let be for three days, applying to the cauterized site sulphur beaten up with oil, until the whole eschar comes away, and all the corruption.	0.8575962
Then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth.	Then treat with stimulating ointments.	0.7013738
If, after three days, you see that the flesh is growing healthily without corruption, then [it is fine]; otherwise, repeat the cauterization on the remaining corrupted areas.	If after three days you see the flesh growing healthily and no corruption in it, good. Otherwise repeat the cauterization over whatever corrupt parts are left.	0.8877139
The corroding ulcer can also be treated with a potent medication, as it acts as a quicker substitute for fire.	Gangrene is also sometimes cured with caustic, for that takes the place of fire; but the actual cautery acts more speedily.	0.6229383
I have mentioned its treatment with the potent medication in the classification, so take it from there whenever you need it.	I have already spoken of the treatment of it by caustic in its section, so take it from there when you have need of it.	0.8093441
