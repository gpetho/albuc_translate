If a fracture does happen to it, it will be either a splitting or a shattering which may be simple or compound; and all these can be palpated.	If indeed a fracture occurs, then it is nothing other than a crack or hole in its parts. And it is either with a wound or without a wound. And it is all felt with sensitivity.	0.6750852
Now the way to set is for the separated parts of it to be put right with the fingers, so that they unite and join as far as straightening and gentleness and skill can serve.	And its restoration is such that the parts which are disrupted are aligned with the fingers, until they are joined and connected as evenly and easily as possible.	0.7334475
Then apply the plaster and put upon that a circular splint, if need be, and over that a suitable bandage.	Then place a plaster made from sesame flour, or mill flour, with egg white; place a round splint over it if needed, and bind it with a bandage suitable for it.	0.7341908
Then keep an eye on it for all the conditions described for the other fractures, such as an effusion and the like, meeting whatever arises with what is good for it, until it is healed.
