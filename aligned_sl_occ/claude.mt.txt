Oh, sons, since I have completed this book for you, which is the last on the science of medicine, for its completion I have achieved its end, and through its explanations and declarations, it seems to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is part of the operation by hand, that is surgery.
For the operation by hand is prostrate in our region and in our time totally deprived, so much so that the science of it nearly perished, and its vestiges are removed; and nothing remained of it except some small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which changed hands and errors and hesitations befell them until its intentions are closed and its strength and art are elongated.
And it seems to me that I should revive it with the ordering of this treatise on it according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and so that it may come with the forms of cautery instruments and other instruments of the work as it is by addition of the declaration, and by preparation of it, which thing is necessary.
But the reason why a good practitioner with his hand is not found in our time is because the art of medicine is long, and it is fitting for its practitioner before that to be exercised in the science of anatomy which Galen recounted until he knows the uses of the members and their forms, and their conjunction and separation; and has the knowledge of the bones, nerves and muscles, and their number, and their emergence; and of the pulsating and quiet veins, and the places of their exit.
And for this Hippocrates says that with a name it is much, but in the work little, and especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already spoken of that in the introduction of this book; for who is not knowledgeable of what we have said about anatomy, is not exempt from falling into error by which men will die, as I have seen many of those, for some are trained in this science and throw themselves into it without knowledge and without experiment.
For I saw a foolish and inexperienced doctor incise a scrofulous abscess in the neck of a woman, and he cut some arteries of the neck so that great blood flowed until the woman fell dead between his hands.
And I saw another doctor who took that he would extract a stone from a man who had advanced in his age, and the stone was large, and he came to him and extracted that stone with a piece of the bladder, for which that man on the third day died.
And I was already called to extract it, and I saw that because of the size of the stone and the disposition of the patient I knew about him that he would die.
And I saw another doctor who took a stipend from a duke of our land for surgery, and it happened to a castrated black man who had a fracture in his thigh; and the doctor prepared with his ignorance, extracted the fracture, over the wound, with pillows and splints with strong binding, and did not leave the wound to breathe.
And afterward he untied it according to his desires, and afterward he retied it, and afterward he left it for some days and ordered that we should not untie the binding; and it stayed thus until the thigh and the foot became abscessed, and it came to ruin.
And I was called to him, and I prepared to untie the binding, and tranquility was achieved and thus his pains diminished.
But however corruption was already confirmed in the limb, for which I could not restrain it, and the corruption did not cease to spread in the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another doctor who perforated a cancerous abscess, and it was ulcerated after some days, until its malignancy was magnified with its lord.
Which thing is because the hot cancer is pure of melancholic humor, then it is not fitting that it should be approached with iron at all, unless it be on a member which could suffer to be entirely removed.
And for this, sons, it is necessary for you that the operation by hand be divided into two divisions: that is, into operations which are associated with health, and into work which is perilous in the major dispositions.
And I have already excited this in every place of this book in which came an operation in which there is error and fear; for which it is necessary for you to guard this and leave that, so that fools do not find a way to speak and to dishonor you.
And thus take your weapons with solicitude and with the protection of God, and your patients with happiness and with firmness.
And use the best way by the grace of God leading to health and to praiseworthy succession, and leave the terrible diseases of difficult healing, and remove your weapons from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation in your faith and in your name does not evade you: for more remains to your glory, and higher in the world and lastly to your sanctities.
Galen already said in some of his admonitions: "Do not treat bad disease, so that you are not named bad doctors".
And I have already divided this book according to three chapters.
The division of the book begins, and first of the first part. The first chapter ordered from the head to the feet, on the forms of instruments and on the iron tools of cauteries, and on that which is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, on cutting and perforation, and on cupping glasses, and on wounds, and on extraction of arrows and similar to those, all chaptered and ordered on the forms of instruments.
The third chapter, on restoration and dislocation, and on curing of torsion and similar to those; chapter ordered from head to feet, and on the forms of instruments.
It is fitting that I say the quality of the benefits of that cautery and of its harms, and in which complexion cautery is prohibited.
Thus I say that the discourse on the quality of the benefit of cautery and of its harm is a long and prolix discourse, and subtle by science, and hidden secret; and already a great multitude of wise men have spoken of it, and they have disagreed about it, and for me a little of their discourses suffices, fearing prolongation.
And thus I say that cautery confers to every complexion universally which is with matter or without matter, except two complexions, which are hot complexions without matter.
In the hot and dry complexion with matter they disagreed; for some said that cautery is beneficial to it, and others said the contrary of that, that cautery is not suitable in disease which is by quality and by dryness, for the nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it is unsuitable that hot and dry disease be healed with that which is hot and dry.
And he said who says the contrary of that, that by cautery benefit is made in every hot and dry disease that comes in the bodies of men, for when you compare the body of man and its humidities to the complexion of fire, you find the body of man cold.
And I say by the discourse of that, that experiment has already sometimes revealed this to me.
But however it is not fitting that he come upon this who is already proven and exercised in the chapter of cautery by last exercise, and has known the diversity of the complexion of men and the disposition of diseases in themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and the space of time of those.
But in the other complexions, there is no fear upon you, and especially in cold and humid diseases, for already all the doctors have agreed upon those, and they have not disagreed on the benefit with cautery in those.
And know, sons, that of the secret of curing by cautery with fire and of its goodness, this is above cautery with burning medicine, because the fire is simple, the action of which does not reach except to the member which is cauterized and does not harm another member joined with it except with little harm.
But the action of burning medicine reaches to that in the members which are distant from it, and very easily brings disease of difficult healing to the member and very easily kills.
But fire, by its sublimity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this except that it is superfluous. And it is already known to us by experiment and by length of service of study with the art on the truth of things; and for this I am excused from the length of the discourse. And if it were not that it is not allowed in my book in this I would set down for you a hidden secret with fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies and of its expulsion by which it expels diseases, with demonstrative philosophical discourse, which would be sharpened in your thoughts.
And know, sons, that they disagree about the time in which it is suitable to do cautery and they set the best time as spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the harm by accidental time is submerged in the benefit of that which is attracted by the cautery, and especially if the cautery is for pains or for necessary, strong and fistulous pains, which do not suffer delay because it is feared that malice may come from them, which is greater than the little harm entering through time.
And this does not fall in your thoughts, oh sons, this is not estimated except by the vulgar people and foolish doctors, that is that for that disease which is healed by cautery there is not always a return, and they set that consequence.
And the cause is not at all as they think for this, because cautery is nothing but in place of medicine which alters the complexion and dries the humidities which are the cause for which the pains come.
But however cautery surpasses medicine by the velocity of its validity and virtue of its operation and greatness of its lord.
And it is possible that his disease returns at some time, according to the complexion of the patient and the location of his disease, and his strength, and that which is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in him, and that which has come to him in his acquisition in foods and similar things; unless the disease in which cautery is administered is a subtle disease in a member of few superfluities and humidities, such as cautery of tooth for pain and similar to that, it is possible that in him that pain does not return, but this happens in small cases.
And more vulgar discourse is that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, and it is righteous discourse, not to that which they understand in it, for they believe that there is no cure that profits with medicine nor with other thing after cautery.
And the cause is contrary to that; and the intention that cautery is the last remedy of medicine is only when we administer the manners of cure in some diseases, and those medicines do not confer, and afterward at the end of the matter one administers cautery, and it profits to that. And then from here it falls that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, not according to the intention which the vulgar and many of the foolish doctors understand.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they said this only because of the equality of gold and the sublimity of its substance.
And they said that the place of cautery does not make pus, though this is not absolutely true, for I have already proved this and have found that it does not do this except in some bodies without the others, and cautery with that is good and better than with iron as they said; but however when you make cautery with fire with gold, it is not declared to you, for it is ignited according to the quantity that you want by the redness of the gold, and because it prepares to receive cold; and if you add ignition over it, the gold melts by the fire, and some sheets fall in the fire by which the artificer falls by the occupation of that.
And for this, cautery is made with iron by us more easily and more proximately to rectitude of operation.
And I have already ordered this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and have ordered those from the head to the feet, so that they lighten the one demanding that which he wants from it.
The first chapter.
This cauterization confers to the humidity and coldness over the brain, accident of which are two causes, that is cause of headache and multitude of rheumatic flux, called coryza, flowing from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and multitude of sleeping, and of tooth pain and of the throat, and universally of all disease that comes by coldness, such as paralysis, stupor and apoplexy, and similar to those diseases.
The form of this cauterization is this, that firstly you command the patient to be evacuated with laxative medicine cleansing the head, for three or four nights, according to what the strength of the patient and his age and his custom require.
And afterward command him to shave his head with a razor, and afterward make him sit between your hands on a square bench and that he place his hands on his chest.
And afterward place the root of your palm near the pulse over the root of the nose between his eyes. But however, when your middle finger has reached, mark that place with ink, and afterward ignite the olive-shaped cautery of which this is the form:
And afterward place that over the place marked with ink, in a manner that descends, with which your hand should be constrained little by little, and you revolve that.
And afterward lift your hand lightly and look at the place, and if you see already some quantity of the bone of the head to be uncovered, like the quantity of a grain of vetch, then raise your hand, and if not return your hand with that iron, with another of that, if it is cooled, until that which I have said to you is seen of the bone.
And afterward take a little salt and dissolve it over the place and leave it for three days.
And afterward place cotton soaked in butter over it and leave that over it until the scab from the fire is destroyed. And afterward treat the place with tetrapharmacon ointment until it is healed.
And they already said that when the wound remains open, the better it expels the pus, which is better and more helpful.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until some part of the bone's surface is burned.
And afterwards, what is burned of the bone should be scraped, and then it should be cured.
And others said that with the cautery one should reach to the back, until it makes a strong impression on the bone until the bone falls, and this is the form of small alphecati: And they estimate that vapors from the head expire from that place.
And the wound should be kept open for a long time, and afterwards it should be cured until it is consolidated.
But I have not seen these two types of cautery at all, except in some men by way of fear; and leave that, in my opinion, it is better with health, when it is; because the head is weakened by the solution of continuity of it as we have testified in other members, and especially when the patient's head is of weak nature.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion; and I use that and work with it safely.
Second Chapter.
On the cautery of the head.
When chronic and long-lasting pain occurs in the whole head and this is prolonged in the patient, and he uses jars and beds and head purges and plasters and cats and puppies and hens and similar things, and especially if he has already been cauterized with a cautery which we recount and none of these things benefit him, then consider that if the patient's head is of strong creation in its nature; and it is not weak and finds very great cold, then cauterize that with another cautery below that one a little. And afterwards cauterize that over the horn of his head with cautery until the skin is separated. Cut the skin and let it be uncovered from the bone the quantity which we have recounted and cauterize that with a cautery in the back part of the head in the place which is called vas, — and that is the place where a cupping glass is placed. And ease your hand in this, and do not uncover the bone, because the patient finds very great pain different from the pain of all the other cauteries of the head.
And I will say this cautery in its place, because it is appropriate that the cautery with which the horns of the head and the occiput are cauterized is a more subtle cautery than that with which the middle place of the head is cauterized; and this is the form of it.
Third Chapter.
On cauterization of non-chronic migraine.
When sudden pain occurs in part of the head, or pain extends to the eye, evacuate the head with purifying medicines, and administer the other cure, which I have described in the division of illnesses; and if all doesn't help, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with acute burning medicine, or with iron.
But cautery with burning medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, peel it and cut off its ends on both sides. And then cut the painful area in the temple with a wide lancet until a space is made under the skin, until it is hidden.
And then tighten it with a stopper for proper constriction, and leave it for the space of three hours; and then untie it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, and then place cotton soaked in butter until the area forms pus.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines which I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron is done in this manner: heat for cautery which has this form:
and it is called nail-keys, because its head is in the form of a nail in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it is a small protrusion.
And then place it on the painful area, and hold your hand — so that the artery which is below is not burned — and turn the iron little by little with speed.
And if the quantity that is burned through the thickness of the skin is about half of it, raise your hand so that the artery which is below is not burned, so that there is no flow of blood.
And then soak cotton in salt water and place it on the area, and leave it for three days; and then place cotton moistened with butter, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the end of the knife-like second cautery, and guard against cutting the artery in this properly non-chronic migraine.
Chapter four.
On cauterization of chronic migraine.
When you treat migraine with what we have said about the preceding cure, and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and the cure is not effective, and you see that the disease is not alleviated by what we have said about the first cautery with medicine or cautery with fire, then it is necessary that you heat the knife cautery until it becomes white-hot, then mark the location of the pain with a line half the length of a finger, or thereabouts; and place your hand once and press it until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful of the continuation of the jaw, which moves during chewing, and that the muscle is not burned and the nerve which moves it, and that spasm does not occur.
And if it is about the protection and caution of blood flow from the artery that is cut, because in cutting it there is fear, especially for one who ignores what he does and is not studious and experienced; and leave the operation at the beginning.
And I will come with a reminder of the management of accidental blood flow from the artery according to its manner, in its place in this book.
And if you see that this cautery is not sufficient for this disease and you see the patient's body can tolerate it, cauterize it in the middle of the head as we have recounted, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we have mentioned in the chapter on constriction of artery with cautery having two knives, and this cauterization is better and more conferring.
Chapter 5.
On cauterization of ear pains.
When pain comes to the ear from cold and is treated with laxative things and with the other cure which I have said in the division, and the pain is not removed, then heat the cautery, and this is the one which is called "puncta", of which this is the form:
And after puncturing after the heating, and let it be moved around the entire ear as a wheel is turned, or in the circuit of each together if the pain is in each. Extend yourself with the cautery from the root of the ear little by little after you have marked the place with a probe.
And if the cautery of ten points in the whole ear, and almost that, and afterwards treat the places until they are healed.
Chapter 6
On the cauterization of torticollis (or facial paralysis).
Torticollis which is cured by cauterization is only of the types which come from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid cauterization of the type that occurs due to dryness or spasm of the nerve.
When you treat that type of torticollis with jars, head purgatives, and gargles, and your treatment doesn't work, then you should cauterize the patient with three cauterizations: one at the root of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the sick part, because softening only comes in the part that appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize with the cautery at the right of the highest extremity of the ear a little above the corner of the head, and another at the temple, the length of which should be according to the length of the thumb, and apply your hand with the cautery until half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type of knife-like instrument, the form of which is set before. But it is more subtle than that, a little like you see; and it should be a knife in place of excessive thickness a little.
And afterwards, treat the place with what has been prescribed before until it is healed.
Chapter 7
On the cauterization of chronic apoplexy.
When apoplexy is chronic and you treat it with what we have said and your medication doesn't work and the patient doesn't have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauterizations: above all the corners of his head; and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said; and with a cautery at the nape of the neck. And the manner of cauterization is done as said above.
And it is already cauterized above the mouth of the stomach; and it is more behind; and afterwards it should be treated with what follows.
Chapter 8.
On cauterization for forgetfulness caused by phlegm.
It is appropriate to give the patient at the beginning large pills that purify the brain.
And afterwards shave the patient's entire head and place on the back of their head a plaster of cedar described in the treatise on plasters.
And apply that several times, for that is a manner of cautery. And do this according to the same order which I have already mentioned.
And then if by these he is healed it is good; and if not, then make three cauterizations on the rear part of his head, which should descend from the highest part of the head to the lowest part of the neck. And place between each cautery the thickness of a finger, and afterwards treat the cautery with what has proceeded.
But if you want addition and the patient can tolerate it, then make a cautery in the middle place; and if you want more addition, then cauterize above the two horns.
Afterwards treat that until it is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form given before.
Chapter 9.
On cauterization for paralysis and softening of the whole body.
It is appropriate that you proceed in purifying the head with pills and with what we have said; and afterwards shave the patient's head, and afterwards cauterize it with cautery in the middle of the head, and with cautery above all the horns of the head, and with cautery on the rear part of it, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the illness of softening of the body of many and the patients tolerating and the illness is strong, then cauterize with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and lastly with cautery until much of the skin is burned, and lift your hand. And afterwards treat that until it is healed, and this should be an olive-shaped cautery.
Chapter 10.
On cauterization for epilepsy.
The epileptic is not cauterized unless that epilepsy is due to phlegm.
And so it is appropriate that you purify his brain at the beginning with pills and with the other treatment which we have mentioned in the division when the patient is large and is tolerating the administration of medicines.
And if it is a child who does not suffer the medicines, then administer gargles and chewing substances that purify the brain, before this for many days, with improvement of the foods.
And afterwards shave the patient's head, and afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head according to the preceding manner, and with another cautery on the back of his head, and cauterize above each horn of his head. And if the patient is strong and is tolerating, then cauterize with the cauteries which I have mentioned, in having paralysis and softening of the body on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped as preceded.
But if the patient is a child, then place a subtle cautery according to this manner.
Chapter 11
On the cauterization of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupt humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize it with the cautery we mentioned for paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess tending towards melancholy, and the patient's body is humid, then give to drink that which purifies the brain according to what was previously mentioned in the division.
And then shave the patient's head, and then make a proper circular bandage of linen, and then place it in the middle of the head.
And the patient should be seated squarely, and be held from all sides.
And then apply a liniment; and it is best made of old sheep's butter. And heat it over the fire for moderate warming, which the aforementioned can tolerate when it is applied to him. And then pour it in the middle of his head in the circle, and leave it until it has cooled.
And do this with the patient once every week, with the other good regimen until he is healed; or if you wish, cauterize him making small points according to his condition, unless you hold the hand with a cautery ordered thus: this is a type of cautery which moistens the brain equally.
And then place cotton soaked in butter or chicken fat.
Chapter 12
On the cauterization of water descending in the eye.
When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs which I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient to drink that which purifies his head, and protect it from all humidities.
And make him sweat in a bath for some days.
And then command him to shave his head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head; and then cauterize it with two cauteries over the two temples if it is the beginning of water coming out in both eyes, or on one side if it is the beginning of water in one eye.
Cut with cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin; and let the cauteries be far in the width of the temples.
And guard against blood flow when it is cauterized; and if you see blood flow from it, stop it with some medicine, which is possible for you.
And I will come with wisdom which is in the extraction of arteries and with the cutting of those and caution of blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck under two bones with two cauteries produced at the back.
Chapter 13
On cauterization of chronic tears.
When tears from the eyes are chronic and persistent, and through the veins and arteries which are in the visible part of the head outside, and it is verified that this is cold phlegmatic superfluity, then cauterize it with the cautery which we have described in the chapter on the beginning of water falling in the eyes, and with cautery in the middle of the head and with two cauteries on the neck below the two temples, and with two cauteries on the neck below two bones. And if you need additional treatment, then cauterize it on all sides of the corner of the eye above the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter 14
On cauterization for foul smell of the nose.
When you treat it with what we have said in the division and your medication does not help, then prepare and give the patient the cochias to drink for three nights; and after shaving his head, cauterize it with a medium cautery with an olive-shaped cautery. And after, cauterize it with a nail-shaped cautery with two cauteries above the two eyebrows below the hair a little.
And be careful of the artery that you do not cut it.
And this is the form of the nail-shaped cautery.
Chapter 15
On cautery for softening of the eyelids.
When the eyelid is softened by illness or humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a cautery with this lunar cautery; and this is its form:
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries in each part, and let them be distant from the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the eyebrow.
And do not press your hand too much with the cautery, but according to the amount that a third part of the eyelid is burned.
Chapter 16
On cautery of the eyelid when the hairs are turned inward and prick the eye.
When the eyelashes are turned inward so that they prick the eye, cautery on them is done in two ways, for cautery is either with iron or with burning medicine.
If with cautery of it with fire, command the patient before this to leave his hairs as those which clean them, until they are lengthened and evened; and if they prick him towards their growth, then you tighten his eyes with a band so that it is not moved until the hairs have grown.
Then when they will have grown and evened, then place the patient's head in your lap, and after mark on his eyelid with ink, with a mark which is in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
And after, place cotton soaked in egg white or in mucilage of psyllium on the eye.
And after, heat the cautery of which this is its form:
And then cauterize over the figure which you have marked, little by little, many times, until the surface of the skin is burned, which is like a myrtle leaf, all appearing properly.
And a sign of the health of your work is that you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted and the hairs of it raised towards the puncture of the eye.
And then raise your hand and leave it for three days, and afterwards place cotton with butter on it until the scab is removed. And afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if something returns through the hairs after their growth and the eyelid is softened, then do the cautery again over all of it just as you had done at first.
But if the hairs are on the lower eyelid, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is evened out and so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
But the cautery with burning medicine is this: that you command the patient to leave the hairs until they are prolonged and evened out, and afterwards make the shape of a myrtle leaf from a piece of cloth.
And then take known soap and quicklime, one ounce each, or thereabouts, and then mix these things well, and do this quickly so that it does not cool; and then spread this over the paper which is made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over one eye or both; and place cotton soaked in egg white under the eye, and let the patient's head be in your lap.
And place your finger on the medicine and press it a little and do not move it until the patient feels the burning of the medicine, for the burning is in it like fire.
And so when he perceives that burning sensation, then leave the medicine and move it with your finger; so when the burning stops, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; and then consider if you see the eyelid is already raised as it is washed from the constriction with fire or with incision, for then it is good; and if not, return some of the medicine to the place where the medicine has not impressed and does not darken until your operation is evened out and the eye is contracted.
And afterwards place cotton with butter on it until the skin of the burn is removed, and afterwards treat it with deafinicon ointment or with another until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, you must in your operation guard with vigilant diligence that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye, and if the eyelid after some days is softened and something of the hairs pricks the eye, then repeat your medicine on that place of the eyelid which is softened, and properly as you did at the beginning, and afterwards surround it until it is healed.
And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men are diversified according to their size and smallness, and so according to this your contraction is made.
And the way of rectitude will not be hidden from the one who studies this art.
Chapter 17.
On cauterization of a fistula that is in the tear duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula with what we have said in the divisions of diseases and your treatment doesn't work, then it is appropriate that you cauterize it in this manner: command the patient to rest their head on your lap, and have some assistant hold their head between your hands in such a way that it is not moved or shaken with their head.
And then place cotton soaked in egg white or in psyllium mucilage over their eye.
And then heat the cautery which has this form:
Which should be concave, like the shape of a cane or a vulture's feather, from one end with which the cautery is made.
And if you want, it should be penetrating up to the other end. And if you want it to be solid like a probe.
But however, the one that is concave is better for your work.
And then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the pus and dry it. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the corruption from it.
And then place the cautery over it which should be well heated, and hold your hand a little towards the cautery of the eye to the part of the nose, so that your hand does not err or the patient is not disturbed, and then place the cautery in the corner of the eye and destroy it.
And so if at the beginning of your cautery it reaches to the bone, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if necessary; and leave it like this for three days, and then place cotton with butter over it and around it with drying ointment until it is healed.
But if eleven days have passed and it is not healed, then place sharp corrosive medicine over it until the bone is uncovered and is scraped according to what is appropriate in its chapter.
And there is another manner of cautery for fistula which some first said: attend to the place of the fistula and split it and then place in that fissure subtle chamomile of which this is the form: And melt in it the quantity of 1 ounce of melted lead; and hold your hand with the chamomile with good retention, and the patient should not be moved so that the melted lead does not reach their eye; and it is appropriate that you place over the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white or in water, because lead hardens the place of the fistula and heals it by marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said of the cautery and the treatment, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to administer a hole in the nose and reduce the fistula to the course of the nose according to what will come in its proper place.
Chapter 18
On cauterization of lip fissures.
Many times fissures occur on the lips, especially on the lips of children.
So when you treat these fissures with what we have said in the divisions and your treatment doesn't work, then heat the small knife-like cautery according to this form that follows:
And let its concavity be according to the fineness of the blade.
Then place that heated instrument quickly in those fissures until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
And then treat it with salves until it is healed.
Chapter 19
On cauterization of fistula in the mouth.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the uvula or in the palate or at the roots of the teeth and then forms pus, and then breaks, and then becomes chronic, and pus runs and a fistula is formed, and then you treat it and it doesn't heal, then it's necessary that you heat a cautery according to the size that can be received in the fistula, and then put that heated instrument in the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth, doing this once or twice at the end; and then treat it with what we have said about the cure until it is healed.
And so if the infection is cut off and it is healed, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone according to what will come in its chapter.
Chapter 20
On cauterization of the teeth and softening of the gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are loose, and you treat them with medicines and it doesn't help, then place the patient's head in your lap, and then heat the cautery whose form will come after this, so that you place the cannula over the tooth and introduce into it the heated cautery quickly, and hold your hand a little until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
And then lift your hand, and then repeat the cautery several times as you wish.
And then the patient should fill their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out, because the loose tooth is secured and the softened gum is tightened and the corrupted moisture is dried out.
Chapter 21.
On cauterization for tooth pain.
When tooth pain is due to coldness, or there is cold or worm in it, or treatment with medicine doesn't work, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with cow dung, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with dung is when you take cow dung and boil it in an iron spoon, then take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe, then dip it in the boiled dung, and place it quickly on the painful tooth until it cools.
And then repeat this several times until the power of the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, submerge wool or cotton in the aforementioned dung, and place it on the aching tooth, and place a heated iron on it until the iron reaches the depth of the tooth's cavity.
But cauterization with fire is when you use a tube of copper or iron, and there should be some thickness in its core so that the intensity of the fire doesn't reach the patient's mouth.
And then heat the cautery, the shape of which will come, and place it on the tooth and hold it with your hand until the cautery cools; and do this several times because the pain will be removed either that day or the next.
And it's appropriate that after the application of this cautery, the patient fills their mouth with good butter and holds it for an hour and then spits it out; and this is the form of the cautery.
And cauterize with whichever end you wish, as is possible for you.
And this is the shape of the tube:
Chapter 22.
On cauterization of scrofula.
When scrofula is from phlegm and cold humors and doesn't respond to digestion by medicines and you want to digest them easily, then you heat the concave cautery, the shape of which is as follows, having two open ends so that the smoke escapes from the cautery through the other end, and place it heated on that abscess once, and again if you need to, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and afterwards leave it for three days and place cotton soaked in butter on it until what the fire has burned is removed.
And afterwards treat it with ointment and probes and cloths until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
On cauterization for hoarseness of voice and constriction of breath.
When humidities come over the channel of the lung, and especially when this is with coldness of complexion, then it's appropriate that the patient be evacuated at the beginning with laxative medicines, and afterwards cauterize them towards the root of the throat in the depressed place.
And be careful that you don't reach the throat with the cautery nor burn the skin except a little.
And cauterize it with another cautery towards the joint of the neck in its last vertebra. And the cautery for it should be a nail according to the preceding manner.
And afterwards treat it with what has preceded until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
On cauterization for lung disease and cough.
When cough and lung disease are from cold humors and the patient has no fever or consumption and it's an old illness, then cauterize with two cauteries above the clavicle in the depressed, smooth and hollow places; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be nail-shaped according to the preceding form.
And if you wish, let your cauterization be puncturing with the cautery called "puncta", the form of which precedes in the puncturing for ear pain.
And let them be punctured almost to those; and afterwards cure it with the same that was prescribed until it is healed.
And there is a cautery having three branches because cauterization is with that: with one time you can make three cauteries according to this form:
Chapter 25.
On cauterization of the titillic which is the head of the humerus.
When the head of the helper is dislocated due to slippery humors and is not fixed at the time of its return to its dislocation until it becomes accustomed to returning, and after a small movement it is dislocated as it happens, as we have testified, then it is appropriate to first reduce the dislocation, and afterwards the patient should be turned over onto his back or onto his healthy side; and after elevate the skin which is on the inside part of the [unknown word] to the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated to the inner parts.
And after ignite the cautery having two heads; and this is its form:
And after cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side; and the figure of cauterization will then come from four cautery heads.
And sometimes it is added according to this count 1 so that the cauteries are 8.
And after place over the cautery [unknown word] cooked with salt, and after make the patient adhere to tranquility, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is to the upper parts and this is rarely done, then cauterize over the muscle with a nail cautery or with many pointed cauteries, because the joint is confirmed and the humidity is removed and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
On cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and many humors come into the stomach until they extract it from its complexion and rheumatisms are multiplied in it, and if you continue the ways of curing and they do not confer, then it is appropriate that the patient be on his back supine, and extend his hands and his thighs, and after cauterize him with three cauteries: with one cautery below the chest by the quantity of one finger with a nail cautery, and with two cauteries below the two sides of the cautery, until the figure of the cautery comes triangulated; and separate between them so that they are not joined which will make putrefaction.
And if the depth of the cautery is the quantity of two-thirds of the thickness of the skin.
And let the figure of the cautery be according to this form without addition, And if you want, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle place of the stomach according to this form; and this should be a cautery according to the form of a circle according to this form:
And let the stomach be cauterized by puncturing for one who is frightened of this cautery: and it is that you mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity that you want with a probe, and after cauterize it with a cautery on the points; and after cure it with the cure that is prescribed until it is healed.
Chapter 27
On cauterization of the cold liver.
When pain occurs in the liver due to cold, humidity, or excessive gas until it is thrown out of its normal composition by excessive excretion, and the patient is treated with what we have said and it doesn't work, then the patient should lie on his back, and mark with ink three cautery points in this form and this same quantity on the liver below the hypochondria, where the patient's body rests.
And let the space between each cautery be the width of a finger, and let the cautery be according to the straight length of the body.
And do not press too hard with the cautery.
And if the quantity of what is burned is half the thickness of the skin, and no more is added; and if the patient is standing on his feet; and if he is not standing, then he should be lying down, with his thighs extended, and raise his arms.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife-like cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to proceed too much in the cauterization, and let the thickness of all the skin be burned so that the whole body is burned and it reaches to the intestines, because the skin there is thin; and know this.
Chapter 28
On perforation of liver abscess with cautery.
When an abscess or apostema occurs in the liver and you want to know if that apostema is in the flesh of the liver or in its tunic, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient finds heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the tunic of the liver, with the pain there is great sharpness and you see that the doctors are already fatigued with its cure.
Therefore, it is appropriate that the patient be turned on his back; and then mark the location of the apostema with ink; and then heat the cautery which is similar to a ray, the form of which was shown on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until all the skin is burned, until it reaches the peritoneum, until pus comes out.
And afterwards, treat it by curing the other apostemas until it is healed.
And it is not appropriate that this form of cautery be used except by one whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged, and in whose hands many diseases have been known; but this with experience sometimes be bold on this operation, but however leave that to us, and it is better.
Chapter 29.
On cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients said that cautery of the roots of aristolochia for pleurisy should be done in this manner: take from the roots of long dry aristolochia a root as long as can be found, and let it be of the thickness of a finger.
And then submerge it in oil and heat it in the fire, and then cauterize with a cautery in that place which is between the continuation of the clavicle with the neck; and with two small cauteries below the guideline, declining a little to the part that is under the beard, and with two cauteries in that which is declining between the fifth and sixth rib, declining a little to the back parts; and with another cautery in the middle place of the chest; and another over the stomach, and with three cauteries of the back parts; and with a cautery in that place which is between the two shoulders, and with two cauteries of the two sides of the chest, below the cautery which is between two shoulders.
And it is not suitable that you press your hand with the cautery, but let it be manifest on the skin in work.
And some ancients already said that there are some men who use an iron cautery similar to a ray and heat it, and put it in that place which is between the ribs, until we reach with it to that abscess and the sanies is expelled, as we have said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this perforation with cautery there is not without fear, for one dies soon or a fistula occurs in the place for which there is no healing.
Chapter 30.
On the cauterization of the spleen.
When you cure the disease of the spleen with what we have said about the cure in the division and your cure doesn't work, then cautery is used according to three methods, all of which are proper, of which one is that you make three or four cauterizations along the length of the spleen according to the shape of the liver cauterizations, the shape of which has preceded.
And between each cautery should be the width of a finger or a little more, and the manner of cautery should be the manner which we have said in the liver cautery equally.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and the patient should be lying on their back.
And there is another way of cauterizing, that is that you heat the cautery having two prongs, which we have mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the muscle, and raise the skin which is in the area of the spleen where the patient lies on their left side.
And your raising with which you raise the skin should be according to the length of the body, so that cauterizations are made according to the width of the body.
And then introduce the two heated prongs, very hot, in that area until you penetrate the skin on the other side with them.
And then extract the cautery; and thus four cauterizations are made.
And if you want, cauterize with a cautery having three prongs.
And afterwards you treat the cautery after it has stopped discharging pus for many days, for it is more beneficial than the other preceding things in the treatment.
Chapter 31.
On cauterization of dropsy.
Cautery is not appropriate for dropsy except in specific cases.
When you treat dropsy with the methods of treatment we have mentioned in the division and your treatment is not effective, then it is appropriate to cauterize with four cauteries around the navel, one cautery on the stomach, another on the liver, another on the spleen, two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, one cautery on the right side of the chest, and another cautery on the stomach. And the depth of the cautery should be close to the thickness of the skin.
And afterward, leave the cautery open so that it drains for a long time.
And do not evacuate the patient from treatment after the cautery with what is appropriate so that two intentions are added to him, and healing will be hastened with help.
The shape of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized should be nail-like according to the form that is described above, and the one with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped according to its preceding form.
Chapter 32.
On cauterization of feet and thighs.
When the feet are swollen with dropsy and full of yellow water, it's necessary to cauterize the feet on the back of the foot between the little finger and the ring finger, and raise your hand with the cautery and don't twist it; and then raise your hand, and don't return it completely, because the yellow water drains.
The cautery is according to this form: And then make two cauterizations on the two thighs, and on each thigh make a cauterization with the end of the knife-like cautery. And let the cautery be along the length of the thigh: one below the knee and the other below the middle of the thigh; and on each thigh two cauterizations.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that some water drains from it.
And then treat it with those things which we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
About cauterization of the abdomen.
When the belly is cold and wet to the point that it weakens the virtues, that is the digestive and retentive virtues, which are in the stomach and intestines, and it is treated with methods of curing and doesn't improve, and you see the patient suffering from excessive virtue, then cauterize it with a large cautery on his stomach as preceded in the cauterization of the stomach, with the circular cautery and with four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a subtle nail-like cautery; and with cautery on the lower back over the large bone, or with two cauteries.
And if you see excessive humidity and the patient tolerating this, then cauterize it over the pubic area and over the intestines, and quickly adding two cauteries over the stomach and near the groin, for it is a perfect cure of benefit in which you do not err.
Chapter 34
On cauterization of old hemorrhoids
When there are old hemorrhoids in the back passage or one of thick cold humors or of corrupt humidity, and they are treated with what we have said in the division and your treatment doesn't help, then cauterize with three cauteries over the lowest vertebra of the small back and small triangular, and with a cautery above the navel about two fingers.
And if you doubt that his stomach is cold and his food is not digested, and you see his face swollen, then cauterize it over the stomach with a large cautery as preceded; and with a cautery over the liver, and with another cautery over his spleen with a nail-like cautery, and leave the cautery open for some time, and afterwards treat him until he is healed.
Chapter 35
On cauterization of hemorrhoids after their excision
When you cut off hemorrhoids, then you heat the cautery that is like a ray. Then insert that heated cautery into that cut hemorrhoid, and move your hand until the cautery reaches the orifice of the vein from which the blood comes.
And do this once or twice, for if there are many hemorrhoids, then cauterize each of them as we have recounted, and afterwards treat them with what helps them of the ointments until healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery over the lower back, it is more beneficial in the end.
Chapter 36.
On cauterization of fistulas that are made in the nature behind in the parts of it.
When nature does not obey the work which we have recounted in its place, and the patient is frightened by this, let it be healed with cautery.
So when someone comes with a fistula in the nature behind, and it is old, corrupt sanies and corrupted humors run from it, and so what is most worthy that is suitable is that you probe it with a subtle probe, and afterwards know the quantity of the depth of it with the aforementioned probe.
Afterwards ignite the cautery that is similar to a ray. And afterwards put that ignited cautery in this fistula, and according to the quantity in which the probe entered.
And iterate over that the cautery until those corrupt bodies are burned quickly once or twice or thrice, according to the quantity of your necessity.
And guard yourself from burning of nerve and vein; or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder or to the body of the bowel, then guard yourself from all those places; and do not do this except when the fistula is in a fleshy place and you think that it is not penetrating.
And afterwards cure the place until it is healed.
And if the place is sealed, and the matters are cut off from it, and it remains so for a long time, then know that it is already cured entirely.
And if the matters are not removed from it, then know that it is penetrating or in the depth of it the bone is corrupted, or almost that of those causes of which remembrance will come in its place.
Chapter 37.
On cauterization of the kidneys.
When in the kidneys pain occurs due to cold or gross windiness, and because of this the patient's coitus is diminished, then it is suitable that you cauterize that over the kidneys with cautery over each kidney with nail cautery of which the remembrance preceded.
And very lightly we cauterize with the second a little below, so that three lined cauteries will come, and so they will be more behind in help.
Chapter 38.
On cauterization of the bladder.
When in the bladder occurs weakness and softening due to cold and humidity so that the patient does not retain the urine, then cauterize that in the lower part over the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, and cauterize with a cautery in the right part, and with another in the left of it.
And let the length of each cautery be according to the quantity of the knots of the wrist; and cauterize that with cautery in the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries if it is necessary.
And let it be nail cautery according to what has proceeded.
Chapter 39.
On cauterization of the womb.
When cold and humidity come to the womb, and because of this pregnancy is prevented, and the menses are corrupted, and their occurrence is delayed, and pain happens when they come, then it is appropriate that the area be cauterized with three cauterizations around the navel, as we have said for the cauterization of the bladder; and with cauterization on the lowest part of the back, or with two cauterizations, and let the cauterization be nail-shaped.
Chapter 40.
On cauterization for dislocation of the hip.
When mucous humors are poured into the hip area, and are the cause of its dislocation, and a sign of this is that the thigh is elongated compared to the other when they are compared. And the place of dislocation is found to be almost empty.
Then it is appropriate that you cauterize the patient on the hip area with a circular cautery, after you have marked with ink the circumference of the area as it is turned, so that the part falls in the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the form previously used in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauterizations using a large olive-shaped cautery.
And let the cautery be done according to the thickness of the entire skin; and afterwards treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
On cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain comes to the hip area, and its cause is cold and humidity, the patient is treated with what we have said and it doesn't help, and this is old, then it is appropriate that you purge the patient of thick humors with fetid pills or with artificial pills or similar; and afterwards cauterize it.
And the manner of cautery in this is according to two ways: either cautery with burning medicines, or cautery with fire.
It will be according to two known ways, of which one is that you cauterize it on the hip area with three triangular cauteries in this form; and make good depth with them. And let the space which is between each cautery be the width of a finger if the cautery is olive-shaped or large.
But sometimes let the cautery be on the middle place on the top of the hip so that there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle whose form was previously described in the cauterization for dislocation of the hip, which should be a containing circle and burn the thickness of the entire skin.
This is the method of cautery for sciatica when the pain is adhering to the hip and does not extend to the thigh.
But if it extends to the thigh, then cauterize it with two cauteries above the thigh over the place where the patient indicates the pain is; and with one cautery above the ankle for four fingers a little towards the outer part.
And if the cautery is knife-like, let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
And if the patient indicates that the pain extends to the place near the toes, then cauterize there where he indicates with a cautery for three points or four or more if needed.
And if the patient indicates pain below the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize there with a knife-like cautery.
And be careful in all cauterization that you don't go too deep with the cautery so that you burn a nerve or large artery, and that you don't cause harm or contraction to the patient.
And I have already seen one and another of those who cauterized above the ankle and went too deep in the cauterization, and the leg was swollen until the tumor reached the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted. And afterwards there occurred a strong loosening of the bowels, and after that, death.
And if the pain is in two parts together, cauterize each according to this method.
And some wise men said in the cauterization of the hip a cautery of which this is the method: make something resembling an iron circle of which the circumference is half a palm; and let it be towards its orifice according to the thickness of a date pit or a little less.
And inside that circle let there be another third; and let the space which is between them be the quantity of a walnut; and let these circles be open on two parts; and let the length of those be about one or two walnuts, and make in those an iron handle decently attached to the circles; and this is the form of it:
Afterwards let it be heated in the fire until it becomes red and throws sparks, and afterwards let it be placed on the part of the hip, the patient lying on his healthy side. And then cauterize it with three round cauteries at once.
And afterwards leave it for three days; afterwards plaster it with butter and leave the wound open for many days; and afterwards treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Albucasis says: Oh son, we have used this type of cautery little due to the fear of looking at it, and because we have found few who look upon it.
But it is one of the good cauteries for those who endure it, and it finds its place with them.
But cautery with burning medicines is that you make two circles having a perforated ring in which descends the hook of the iron door; the length of the wall in their height should be two knots or almost that.
And if the space which is between each is the quantity of the thickness of a finger; and they should be open below and above, and should be contained between them according to this form:
And after, place it on the part of the hip of the patient lying on his side, and press your hand on the part of the hip; and then take hot water and pour it between the two circles, and its quality should be with little fire little by little, and hold it for the quantity of an hour, and the patient endures the biting and the burning of it — for they find it biting like fire — until the biting ceases.
And after, lift your hand with the instrument and wipe the hot water from the entire hip with sweet water.
And after, leave that for three days and place butter on it until the blackness of the burn is removed, and leave that for some days, and pus will run from it; this is the last in healing.
And after, treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or the leg, make for it a statue in it that contains water according to what is done in the hip equally.
And this is the manner of hot water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take of alkali and of quicklime of both one part each, and grind them and put in a new pot of which the bottom part is perforated by a small hole, according to the quantity that enters in the ray.
And place below the bottom of the pot another glazed pot, and pour over that alkali and quicklime of sweet water which covers those by a finger, and then you compress those with your hand by good compression, and leave the pot that descends from it sharp water in the part below to the glazed pot.
And after that, gather all that water, and throw it over other quicklime and other renewed alkali, because that will then be of very strong acidity, which is administered in many medical operations and in cauterization of other members, because it performs the operation of fire.
And these are some of the medicines with which the hip is cauterized, such as tezizia and honey anacrat and lime with soap, so that they are mixed.
And Gualia recounted of a man of the ancients the operation and the cure with which hip pain and sciatic vein are cured, and praised it very well to be from that, and said that it had no need of other cure, and because it is healed at once as he recounted, because very easily that one entered the bath and exited already healed from it.
And it is that green certarragi should be taken, and if it is not found green, take a fresh fig; and let it be well ground with a little grease and placed on the hip where the pain is, or on the thigh, or on the leg, and let it be bound.
And let it be left for the quantity of three hours or for the quantity that the patient feels the sedation of the burning.
And after that put him in a bath and then when his body is moistened, introduce him to the sun, because the pain ceases and he is healed.
And know that it is not convenient for anyone to use cautery with these medicines except after the evacuation of the body.
But Escorides already said that when with goat dung the sciatic vein is cauterized, it benefits him very well; and let the cautery be with him according to this manner: let wool be taken and soaked in old oil, and placed between the pulse of the foot and between the ankle.
And after take dry goat dung and inflame it with fire until it is made charcoal; and after place it on the wool and leave it until it is extinguished. And after repeat this, and do not cease doing this until the sensation of the burning reaches to the hip and the pain rests.
And this manner of cautery is called cattle cautery.
Chapter 42.
On cauterization for back pain.
Sometimes pain in the back occurs for many reasons, such as from falling or being struck or excessive evacuation, and for similar causes, due to the influx of cold and humid matter.
And cautery is only necessary in this specific case which is caused by the effusion of cold matter.
Therefore, it is appropriate, after evacuation of the patient with bitter pills and similar treatments, that three lines be made on the back where the pain is, according to its width, then mark with ink on each line five cauterizations or more, depending on the patient's tolerance and strength.
And let the cauterization be done with a point cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauterizations using a medium nail cautery in this form:
Chapter 43.
On cauterization at the beginning of hunchback (spinal deformity).
This disease often occurs in young children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that it affects their structure in the wing area with elevation and movement.
And you find in the last vertebra of the back and its joints that it has already begun to rise above the other vertebrae.
And so when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery in this form: so that the cautery covers every part of the vertebra equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a point cautery in two or three lines. And let the points be close to each other.
And afterwards, treat the area until it is healed with what we have said.
But be careful that cautery is not administered in a hunchback that is caused by nerve spasm.
Chapter 44.
On cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pains are caused by cold humors which are infused into each member of the body, then when pains come to the feet, it is the custom of physicians to call this gout properly.
And so when gout from a cold cause is treated with a method of cure and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.
And it is that you cauterize it after evacuation around the joint of the foot with many cauterizations.
And let it be an olive-shaped cautery of which this is its form:
If it is necessary to make a point on the surface of the foot, then do it with a cautery point. If the pains rise up to the knees or other joints, which often happens, then cauterize above each knee with three or four cauteries on all sides with this olive-shaped cautery.
If many cauteries are necessary for you, then cauterize but do not press your hand too hard with the cautery, only around the thickness of the skin.
If the pains rise up to the knee and back, then administer the cautery which we have mentioned in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, and it is called gout, then puncture in the circuit of the bones as they revolve, puncture in those two lines.
If pain remains in the fingers, then puncture in the circuit of the bones above each joint and on the palm of the hand.
If the pains rise after some days to the elbows or muscles, then cauterize each of them on all parts of the upper arms.
Do not evacuate the patient from good regimen and reception of medicines, for if good regimen is done and phlegm is evacuated with this cautery, he will be healed, God helping.
Chapter 45.
On cauterization of ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestines descend before the hernia to the genitals, and this is beginning nearby, then it is appropriate that you order the patient to stop his eating on that day and to use soothing things so that the split descends from his belly.
And after, let the patient sit between your hands on his back, and command him to hold his breath until it is expelled or the hernia or intestines appear.
And after, return that with your fingers and mark with a probe the rupture above the pubic bone with a sign the end of which is similar to half a circle at the upper parts of the body.
And after, ignite the cautery of which this is its form:
until it is very red and throws sparks. And after, reduce the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and after place his hand over the place so that the intestine does not come out.
And you have already opened between the thighs of the patient and placed a cushion below him, and another servant is on his legs, and another on his chest, who holds his hands.
And after, place the cautery on that mark with your hand with the cautery standing straight, and hold it until with it you reach the pubic bone up to the middle of the pubis; and repeat with it another time if you have not reached the bone on the first attempt.
Observe carefully the exit of the intestine at the time of your cauterization, so that you don't burn that intestine, which could cause death or other great harm to the patient.
Know that when you don't reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is not effective.
It is appropriate that the cautery for children be subtle according to their size and measure.
Afterwards, treat the cauterized area for three days with (unknown substance) until the fire scar is removed.
Then treat it with other ointments until it is healed.
The patient should lie on their back for 40 days until the area and wound are sealed.
It is appropriate to adjust their nutrition according to the length of the healing time, which soothes their belly, and so that the intestine doesn't come out due to the effort of healing.
And after they want to get up after 40 days, then administer a properly made bandage, and keep it for another 40 days.
And let them be reduced in work and in filling with food and drink, and from loud voices, for when they use this regimen of complete healing, they will be healed.
I will tell you about the cure for ruptures in other parts of the belly, and this is at the beginning, and if you don't want them to draw out, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size, and let what is extracted from the skin be about a third of it; and afterwards treat it as we have said, and it is not added.
And some earlier (practitioners) have said that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this form, after it is marked with a probe:
and a line is placed that goes across the width at the upper side of the rupture, and another line above; and lower your hand with a nail cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46
On cauterization of torsion.
When pain occurs in some limbs due to falling or impact and that pain persists for a long time and is not cured with medicines, then it is appropriate to cauterize with a point cautery.
And let the cautery for each limb be according to its size and smallness, and its strength and weakness, and the location of its torsion and pain.
So if it is healed by the first cautery, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery on it; for it is customary for those pains to be punctured from limb to that limb which is close to it, so it is appropriate that you follow them with cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
Lepers sometimes benefit greatly from cautery, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And so when you want to cauterize that, consider if the leprosy is starting and you have treated it with what we have said in the division and it doesn't descend, nor stay, and you fear that the corruption will encompass the patient's entire body and complexion, then cauterize him on the head with 5 cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and the second below it, towards the forehead at the hairline; and both over two horns; and one behind, on the nape or neck.
And move your hand with the cautery a little until it makes a small impression on the bone, and from it the scales are displaced, so that the expiration of thick vapors is alleviated from him; and cauterize over the spleen as previously described.
And if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and appears manifestly, then it is appropriate that you cauterize him with those cauteries which we have mentioned on the head; and with cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two cheeks, and with two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and with six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and with a large one on the vertebrae near the tail, and one on the tail, and with two on the hips, and with one on each hip, and with two on the knees and one on each knee, and with two on the elbows, and with two on the muscles, and with two on the tenderness of his chest; and cauterize him on all the joints of the fingers of the hands and feet, and on each heel of his feet, and on the bones of his hands.
And be careful of the nerves which are on the heel that you do not burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the pubic bone and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you add, the more helpful and beneficial it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery, as healthy people do, because his body is already numbed.
And it is appropriate that the cauteries be large or small according to the limbs and joints as preceded by the types of instruments.
And afterwards, treat the cautery with flour of bitter vetch cooked with honey and with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
On the cauterization of numbness.
When any limb is numb or asleep and is treated with medicines, oils and plasters, and is not healed, then you cauterize that numb limb with cauteries according to what the size of the limb or its smallness merits.
And let your cautery enter the thickness of the skin a little. And afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes some numbness is cauterized which occurs in the hands and feet, and in the vertebrae of the back and towards the exit of the nerves which move that limb, and the numbness is removed.
But do not presume to do this unless one is wise in the anatomy of the limbs and the egress of the nerves moving the whole body.
Chapter 49.
On cauterization of albaras which is morphea.
When albaras is old and does not respond to any of the medicinal ointments, then you cauterize over it with a deep cautery, a little according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness and its color are removed, and its color is changed.
And afterwards treat it with flour of bitter vetch and lentils with rose oil and with leaves of knotgrass, and with pigeon blood or swallow blood, of each take one part and mix them all, and then spread it on a cloth and place it on the spot until it is healed.
Chapter 50.
On cauterization of cancer.
When cancer is beginning and you want to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference as it is revolving.
And the wise men said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle; but I have not seen this, because I fear it may ulcerate, and I have already seen this sometimes.
And it is more proper that it be cauterized around its circumference with a circle as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter 51.
On cauterization of abscesses.
When any abscess is delayed in maturation, and this is due to the excess causing it, or due to the age of the patient, for he is old in decrepitude, of little blood, or due to the time, and you want to hasten the maturation of the abscess; then cauterize around its circumference with many small puncturing cauteries; and afterwards leave it for it will hasten in maturation.
But if you want to perforate it with a cautery, then you heat the cautery of which this is its form: and place it in the middle of the abscess until it penetrates the skin.
And if the cautery is in that place which is lower, so that the body of the arm is relieved; and afterwards treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
On cauterization of corrosive (ulcers).
Corrosive is a moving corruption in the limb, which corrodes it just as fire consumes dry wood.
So if you see that corrosive in a place which tolerates cautery with fire, then you heat many small nail-like cauteries, and large ones according to what is suitable in that place where the corrosive is.
And afterwards cauterize it from all sides until you eradicate all the corrosion and nothing remains of it.
And afterwards leave it for three days, and place on the cauterized places ground sulphur mixed with oil until all the scabs are eradicated and all the corruption.
And afterwards treat it with flesh-generating ointments.
But if after three days you see that healthy flesh grows in which there is no corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cautery over what remains in the corrupted places.
And corrosive is sometimes treated with sharp medicine, for that is put in place of cautery. But nevertheless, cautery with fire is of easier benefit.
And I have already spoken of its treatment with sharp medicine in the division, and so take that when you have need of it.
Chapter 53.
On cauterization of warts and other similar things.
Many times there occurs in the lower parts of the foot a disease called a wart, and it is a large, split thing, which harms the foot; and cauterization for these is done in two ways, that is cautery with fire and cautery with hot water.
But cautery with fire is when you heat the concave cautery resembling a vulture's feather, which is made of iron according to the size that contains the wart on all sides, and has thin edges.
And then place that heated instrument on the wart, and then revolve your hand with the cautery around the wart until the cautery reaches the depth of the wart. And leave it for three days until it begins to discharge pus. And then plaster it with wild mallows crushed with salt, and leave the plaster on it for one night, for it will be eradicated from its roots.
And then treat the area with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if they are not converted, and many times occur on the surface of the body, mainly on the hands and feet, then it is appropriate that you administer cautery with water to them, and it is that you take a cannula of copper or iron or vulture's feather, and place it on the wart; and then pour a small quantity of hot water into the cannula, and hold your hand, and you revolve it with compression of your hand completely, and the edge of the cannula should be pressed into the root of the wart, and the hot water will find a way to the depth of the root of the wart; and the patient should wait a little for the stinging of the hot water for an hour, and then remove it, for the wart with its roots will be eradicated.
And do this with them one after the other until you come upon all of those that are on the body.
And then treat them after the roots of the warts are eradicated with those ointments which generate flesh.
Chapter 54.
On cauterization of tremors.
When someone experiences tremors due to cold in the nerve or due to fever from a cold cause, or from another similar cause, then it is appropriate that you cauterize it with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, between each vertebra with one cautery; and with a cautery on their chest, and on their stomach, with an olive-shaped cautery.
And their tremor subsides and hastens the healing of the cold illness.
Chapter 55.
On cauterization of white spots occurring on the body.
When white spots appear on the body, and they are split pustules which are made of thick corrupt matter; then it is appropriate at the beginning when they appear, that it be cauterized over every head of the fistula with a subtle cautery with myrtle wood, the extremity of which is extended with fire; or with roots of long aristolochia; or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes there is cautery at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner; and they are not increased, and the superfluity causing them is disrupted, and heals from them.
But however, it is appropriate that this be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
Chapter 56.
On cauterization of blood flow accidents due to incision of arteries.
Many times, there is a flow from an artery that is cut towards the wound which happens outside, or from the incision of abscesses or cautery of the limb, and similar things, and it is difficult to remove it.
So when this happens to someone, then you hurry with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger on it, pressing it many times until the flow of blood beneath your finger is stopped, and does not come out.
And then place in the fire the small and large olive-shaped cauteries, many in number, and blow on them until they are very hot.
And then take one of these, small or large depending on the location and the wound where the artery is broken, quickly over that vein after you have removed your finger, and hold the cautery until that blood is cut off and restricted.
And if the blood is expelled from the opening of the artery when you remove your finger and apply the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire, and do not stop doing this one after another until the blood is restricted.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, and that no other harm comes to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to restrict the blood in those, especially when the artery is large, except by one of four ways: either with cautery as we have said, or with extraction when it is not extracted, because when it is extracted the extremities are better burned and the blood is restricted, or that it be tied with thread or with a ligament by strong tightening, or that medicines be placed on it whose virtue is to restrict the blood; and they should be tightened with a cushion with decent constriction.
But he who administers decent restriction of it with binding and with tightening with cloths or by placing burning things and similar, does not succeed except rarely.
But if this happens to someone and neither the doctor nor medicine is present, then work by placing the index finger on the opening of that vein as we have said, and attend to the great constriction of it until the blood is removed from the upper part of the wound, and the finger should not be removed from the artery; and over the artery let it be sprinkled with very cold water until the blood is congealed and thickened; and further consider what need there is for cautery or medicine.
On incision, perforation, cupping, bloodletting, wounds, and similar things.
We have already spoken in the first chapter about all illnesses in which cautery with fire is appropriate and with burning medicine, and the occasions and causes of it, and the necessary instruments with the forms of cautery; and I have ordered the chapters from the top of the head to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that it may be easier for the one seeking this, when they have asked about it.
And before I begin this, it is important, son, that you learn that in this chapter is by terror that which is in the first chapter on cauterization.
And because of this, it is necessary that there be great caution in it, for in the operation which is in this chapter, many times there occurs evacuation which is with blood with which life depends on the sprinkling of the vein or incision on the abscess or opening of the exit or purging of the wound or extraction of arrow or incision of stone and similar things. And of all these are accompanied fear and trembling and in their hands falls death.
And I warn you that upon you does not fall that in which there is hesitation, for sometimes there fall to you kinds of men with many kinds of illnesses. And of them is someone who is angered by his illness and death is light for him, and this is because of the vehemence of what he finds of his illness, and because of the length of his illness, and with the illness is fear which signifies death.
And of those is he who gives you his possessions and says, you hoping with that health, and his illness is pernicious.
And therefore it is not appropriate that you consent to that one who comes to you of whom this is the manner; and your caution should be greater than covetousness and your rapacity; and do not presume anything about this except after certain knowledge which verifies this for you, and to which praiseworthy success comes.
And use in the curing of all your patients prognostication and indication of that to which health is converted, for in that is help for you in acquiring fame and memory, praise and glory.
O, son, may God inspire in you His understanding and not remove from you direction and protection, for that is in His hand.
And I have ordered this chapter distinguishing by chapters according to what preceded in the chapter on cautery, from the cure of the head to the feet, so that it may be easier for you what you ask about this and of which you have need.
Chapter One.
On the treatment of water which is contained in the head of infants.
Know that this illness often occurs in infants during infancy and when the nurse tightens the infant's head without care.
And sometimes it occurs for hidden reasons which are not known.
But I have only seen this illness in infants; and for all those I saw, death hastened, and so it seems to me that treatment for them is abandoned.
And I have seen an infant whose head was filled with water, and his head was always so enlarged that he could not hold it up by himself due to the size of his head, and moreover the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture is either accumulated between the skin and the bone, or is accumulated under the bone above the brain membrane.
For the operation on that, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, then it is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with a cut in the width, and let the length of the cut be about two knots until the moisture flows, and this is the shape of the instrument:
And then if the moisture is more increased and the swelling is larger, then there are two incisions in this manner:
And if the moisture is under the bone, a sign of it is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides and the water is squeezed out when you compress it with your hand on the inside parts and this is not hidden from you. It is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with three cuts in this manner:
and after the incision, extract all the moisture; and afterwards tighten the cuts with cloths and small feathers; and then apply wine and oil on top until the fifth day, and afterwards untie the bandage and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and tighten the head evenly; and let the patient eat dry food with little moisture until the member is strengthened and healed.
And there is another manner of incision, where you consider where the magnitude of the swelling appears and the collection of water, for sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the front part, or on the right, or on the left; and then attend with the incision where the swelling and the repletion of water appear, and make the cut as best as possible for you.
And observe that you do not cut the artery and cause a flow of blood and the patient dies from that blood flow with evacuation of moisture.
Second Chapter.
When someone has catarrh or rheum in the eyes or chest, and it is chronic, and medicines do not cure it, then the last cure for this is the incision of those two arteries.
And so it is appropriate when you want to cut those that the patient shaves his head, and afterwards rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and afterwards the patient's neck should be tightened with a cloth; and afterwards consider where the vein pulses; and the locations of each above the places which are near the depressed ears, and they are hidden except in some men.
And afterwards mark the artery with ink, and afterwards cut each with the spatula from each sharp part with an incision reaching to the bone, and let this be across the width of the head.
And if you want, insert the spatula under the artery and cut it to the incisions in the upper parts.
And let the length of the incision be about two fingers joined, because when a vein is cut the blood comes out with a pulsating flow, which leaps out in frequent spurts.
But if the artery does not appear to the touch, then it is appropriate that you measure from the ear the space of three fingers, and afterwards mark with ink, and cut to the bone.
And what is appropriate to let of blood is a quantity of six ounces, and very easily more or less is let from it, and all this is according to the quantity which appears from the strength of the patient and the fullness of his artery.
And afterwards examine the wound, and then if any part of the membrane remains on the bone, then cut it so that a hot abscess does not occur.
And afterwards tighten the wound with pledgets and with linen bandages, and afterwards treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
On the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
When someone suffers from chronic migraine or acute catarrh, due to acrimonious humors and by quality in the muscles of the temples, or violent chronic headache and similar to those, and is treated with methods of medical cure and this does not help, then we have tried in these illnesses extraction of the arteries in the temples, or cauterization of them as we have shown.
And the manner of the operation and extraction of those is that the patient shaves the hairs which are on the temples; and attend to the apparent artery in the temple for it is shown to you by its pulse, and is hidden except in few men due to the violence of cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then let the patient's neck be tightened with a cloth; and afterwards rub the place with a rough cloth or steam the place with hot water until the artery appears to you manifestly. And then you take the spatula of which this is the form: And afterwards you peel the skin with it with ease until you reach the artery; and afterwards throw in the hook and extract it to the upper parts until you extract it from the skin and uncover it from the tunics which are below it, from all parts.
But if the artery is thin, then wrap it with the end of the hook, and afterwards cut from it a part according to the quantity by which its ends are lengthened and are contracted, and there will not occur a flow of blood, because if they are not cut the blood will not rise at all.
And afterwards, evacuate the blood of wine ounce by ounce up to three.
And if the artery is large, then it is advisable that you tie it in two places with a strong double thread of silk or with long cords, and do not rush to putrefaction before the consolidation of the wound and the occurrence of blood flow.
And afterwards, cut away the excess which is between the two ties; and do this at that hour or after another hour.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone with a knife-like cautery until the extremities are cut, and it will remain in place of that same work.
And it is a better procedure unless the patient has fever or is of a heated complexion; for cautery is one of those things that help with ending humidities, and thus is better in assistance.
And it is advisable after the extraction of the arteries that you fill the place with old cotton, and powders are placed on it decently made, and afterwards it is cured with dry medicines making the flesh grow and with some until it is healed.
And if while you work another time blood flow occurs from the artery, then you hurry to restrict that blood, either with cautery, or by filling the place with cotton, and tighten your hand until the blood is restricted. And if none of those things is present to you, then place your finger on the place until the blood is congealed, and pour water of extreme coldness on the place until the acuteness rests, and let it be tightened as is appropriate.
And what is easier in extraction of artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two knives, after you have marked the two places with a probe, and deposit each, very hot, until they reach the bone and cut the vein in two places, so that what is between their extremities is elongated, for they are not entirely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And let the sharpness of the two knives be together. But if they are less sharp than two knives it is better, because if they are as sharp as two knives it approaches each cold, and they do not cut the flesh with speed.
Therefore when in those there is some thickness, the heat of the fire is held in them and the flesh is easily cut away.
And this work is better in all work and easier.
And let the space which is between two knives be the quantity of the thickness of the finger.
Chapter four.
On the treatment of acute and acidic tears of the eyes.
When there are acidic tears, and it is the course of those veins which are above the outer skull, and no cause of medical cure helps in this, and you see the patient's face already reddening and they feel in their forehead a movement as if it were the movement of ants, and their eyes are weakened, so moist that their eyelashes are stuck together, and the eyelids are heated by the acidity of the tears, the ancients had methods for the cure of these by this operation, and they named this cure with a sword.
And it is that you command the patient to shave the hairs which are on their forehead, and afterwards incise three equally distant fissures on the forehead according to the length of the forehead. And let the length of the fissure be about two fingers: let one fissure be equally distant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little from the movement of the muscles which are in the tear duct, and the third on the other side.
And guard yourself from cutting the arteries which are on both sides, and keep your hand away from the continuation of both jawbones. And let the space of each incision be the quantity of three fingers joined.
And have a piece of sponge prepared or very dry cloths with which you dry the blood.
And afterwards insert the spatula with two sharp ends, of which this is the form of its incision: which is from the temple area to the second incision. Flay with it all the skin which is between two incisions with the membrane which is over the bone, and afterwards do this from the middle incision to the second incision. And afterwards withdraw this spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument which is called a knife, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And place the sharp side towards the flesh attached to the skin, and the smooth side against the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle fissure, and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But let the incision be continued to what appears of the skin, and afterwards do this in the middle fissure until the other fissure.
And after an equal quantity of blood flows, press the places of the pieces of congealed blood.
And afterwards place in each fissure some old cotton, and place over those powders soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and see that no hot abscess occurs.
And on the third day, undo the bandage and administer a large infusion of hot or lukewarm water, and afterwards treat this with basilicon ointment with rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5
On the treatment of tears due to catarrh and for eyes affected by internal parts of the head.
When someone has acute and continuous catarrh, and you see the patient's eyes small and weakened, and their gaze is already debilitated, and the eyelids are ulcerated and losing hair, and there is sharp pain deep in the head and consequent sneezing, then know by these symptoms that the matter and catarrh come only from many veins proceeding from the inner parts.
And the best cure for these is this: order the patient to shave their forehead, and then make an incision in the middle of the forehead, a little in width (and begin with the fissure from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be down to the bone; and keep your hand away from the muscles of the temples which move during chewing), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or dry cloth and then fill between the two lips of the fissure with old cotton or linen cloths. And then tighten above with powders soaked in wine and oil so that no hot abscess occurs.
And when you untie this and see that the abscess has already diminished, then it is appropriate to rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it, and then treat it with a drying regimen which makes flesh grow, as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and mix them, and make a plaster of them and apply it to these wounds for the growth of flesh.
Chapter 6
On the treatment of what falls into the ears.
Everything that falls into the ears is one of four types, for it is either a mineral stone or something similar to stone, such as iron and glass, or it is from a plant such as chickpea or bean, or it is a fluid thing such as water and vinegar and things like them, or some animal.
And so when a stone falls into the ear or another similar thing of those things that do not stick or grow in the ear, and place the ear in the sun, and if you see the stone, then drip some violet oil or sesame oil into it, and then administer its extraction, and make them sneeze with condizi, and block the nostrils during the onset of sneezing. And then place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and extend the ear to the upper parts, for many times it is expelled with these things.
And if it is not expelled, then administer its extraction with the instrument called subtle gesti epicicarios, of which this is the form:
And if it is expelled with gesti, good; and if not, then administer its extraction with a subtle hook of little duplication.
And so if it is not expelled by this, then make a copper tube and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole and close around the tube with wax and softened oil so that nothing is open except the tube. And then extract with your breath with strong suction, for many times with what we have recounted.
But if it is not expelled in this manner, then take a small quantity of illuminated halka or prepared vecz with which birds are caught, and place it at the end of a ray, and then wrap cotton decently placed over it. And then insert that into the ear hole with ease, and then dry the ear of moisture.
And so if it is not expelled with all the things we have recounted, then you hasten to cut it before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the manner of cutting it is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract blood according to their strength, and then make them sit between your hands and turn the ear to the upper parts, and make a small fissure at the root of the ear towards its fat in the well-pressed place of it. Let the fissure be of a lunar shape until it reaches the stone, and, once the stone is found, remove it if you can with appropriate instruments; and then close the fissure at that time with speed, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains that grow and are swollen, then administer the cure and extraction of it; but if it does not obey you to come out, then take a thin, subtle spatula in this form: and use it to cut away that grain which has fallen into the ear.
Do not do this when you think that it has already been moistened by the vapor of the ear, and place it in many pieces, and then extract those with tweezers or with subtle gestures, or with incision as we have said, for the extraction of it is eased.
But for water which has entered the ear, it is advisable that the patient use sneezing with caution at the beginning, and fill his ear with some old cotton, and lie on the ear in which the water is, and if by this it is expelled, it is good; and if not, then take many thin and light stones according to the length of the finger, and heat them in the fire a little, and let the patient insert one of these into the opening of his ear and jump on one foot on that side and strike with another stone on the stone which is inside the ear. Thus, do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled.
Thus, do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled. And the water will be expelled thus: that you take paper or reed, and put one end of it in the ear and extend the other end with fire until most of it is burned.
And then put in another reed and do this so many times until all the water is expelled, and extract it with a tube as is said above about the extracting stone.
But in the extraction of a beast entering that ear, if it is small-bodied, like a flea and similar to it, treat it as we have said in the division; but if it is of large body which appears to the sense of sight, then administer its extraction with gestures and tweezers, and its matter is easier than all the other things that fall into the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm engendered in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations and your treatment does not succeed, then it is advisable that you look at the ear in the sun.
And thus if something of the worms appears there, then extract it with gestures or with subtle tweezers, but if nothing appears, then take a tube narrow below and wide above, of which this is its form: And insert the subtle end into the ear according to the quantity which the patient can suffer; and then suck with it by strong suction, and do this many times, until all the worms are expelled.
But if they do not obey you to come out, then you block and close the circuit of the tube with wax as we have said; then administer distillations which the ancients have already tested in the treatment of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear be with this instrument of which this is its form: And make it of silver or copper, narrow below, in which there is a small hole, and flat above.
And thus it should be with a pushing to what is in the concavity of the tube immediately where it will be necessary. And if you want, take the ray and wrap cotton decently at its end, and then throw oil into the concavity of the hearing, or juice of some herb, or what you want of these medicines in the tube — and that is in the ear —, and then insert the ray with cotton above and squeeze it with your hand with temperate compression of it until the oil is expelled into the concavity of the hearing and the patient feels the oil inside.
And let what is poured into the ear be already heated with fire a little. And guard yourself that the thing which you will distill in the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines do not suffer this.
Chapter 7
On treating blockage of the ears.
Sometimes some children are born from their mothers' wombs with unopened passages, and this also happens in some men, blockage in the ear canal due to injury or flesh growing there; and this blockage sometimes occurs deep in the ear hole which cannot be seen, and sometimes it is in the outer parts.
And that which occurs in the deep part, which cannot be seen, is in the most difficult conditions to heal.
And in that which can be seen, it is appropriate that you place the patient's ear in the sun and look into it. And then if you see an apparent blockage, open it with a thin spatula of which this is the shape:
Let its end be where the width is small, of which one part should be sharp and the other not; and the spatula should be smooth on both sides so that it does not harm the ear.
And then if the blockage is due to flesh growing in the ear or in its canal, then take it with thin hooks and cut it with great care until all the flesh is removed.
And if the blockage is deep in the ear, then take a thin smooth probe and heat it slightly with fire, and afterwards put it in the ear canal.
And then if you have felt the blockage with that which the patient finds easily, due to difficulty in hearing, press on it gently; and be careful not to wound the nerves of the ear.
And afterwards place in the ear a linen cloth according to the width of the hole which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for some days until you are sure of the healing of the wound; or take some lint and soak it in rose water and sprinkle crushed tallow on it and use it; and if you see the ear is already swollen, then it is appropriate that you remove the lint and replace it with other lint which you will wrap in a cerote made with rose oil, until the hot swelling subsides; and afterwards treat it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use the other treatment which stops the flow of blood, which is described in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter 8
On the treatment of growths which occur on the eyelids.
Growths which occur on the eyelids of the eyes are sometimes moist, sometimes dry.
So it is appropriate that you hold these with tweezers or a hook, and cut them from their roots with a spatula, and afterwards place crushed tallow on the areas.
But if pain with bleeding comes, then you cauterize them with a subtle lenticular cautery.
And the best cauterization is after the incisions and many times we return when something remains of its roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9
Treatment of swellings that come to the eyelids of the eyes.
Many times there occurs in the eyelids of the eyes something which is similar to a grain in its strength and hardness, and for this reason it is called a grain.
And it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the lower and upper eyelid.
So the operation on them is that you consider then if the grain is proceeding in it in what appears of the eyelid and is moved to every part; and its cause is light.
So make an incision over it along its width, and afterwards scrape it from every part gently until it comes out, and afterwards suspend it with a hook and cut it off.
And if the wound is large, then you close it with sutures; and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it because the ointment restores it and helps it heal.
And if the swelling is declining towards the inner parts of the eyelid towards the inner surface, then turn the eyelid inside out and suspend the swelling with a hook, unless you need to make an incision, and press it from all sides, and if the eyelid is elongated by the incision, this does not harm in any way.
And after the incision, wash the eye with salt water; and treat the area with that which heals until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
On the treatment of axcirnah in the upper eyelid of the eye.
Axcirnath is a growth which is generated in the layers of the upper eyelid, and mostly happens to children, weighing down their eyes and causing them to have cataracts in the morning; and they cannot look at the brightness of the sun because tears rush to them.
And for this reason you see them lying on their faces all the time, and sleeping on their faces; and their lower eyelids under the eyebrows are moist, which are already covered with swelling, and the presence of accernac is apparent in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel accernac up to them.
And one way of operation is that the patient places his head in your lap, and then places a linen cloth and makes it warm, and makes a circle of it according to the quantity which contains arthernach from all parts, and then places it over it and presses with your fingers all around so that arcernac is gathered in the middle of the circle, and then splits in the middle of that moisture with a cutting spatula with a fissure along the width, and the fissure should not be larger than the fissure made in phlebotomy.
But in depth, it is necessary that you split the entire skin until you reach arcernach, because in most dispositions arcernach proceeds through the fissure in the form of white fat.
Then extract it with cloths which you have wrapped between your fingers to the outer parts and revolve between the right and left hand until it has dispersed.
And be careful not to add to the fissure so that with the spatula you do not reach the eye and damage it.
But if arternach does not appear to you at the beginning of the fissure, but you add a little to the fissure with ease until arternach proceeds; and then extract it as we have said; and then submerge linen cloths in water and vinegar and place them over the area and tighten them with powders.
And there are some who grind salt and place it in the concavity of the fissure so that what remains of that moisture [is removed].
And then treat it until it is healed.
But if a hot abscess occurs in the place, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
On the ways of tactimi of the eye.
When in the eyelids of the eyes hairs are born added below the natural hairs and are old, then those harm the eye and cause kinds of diseases such as constant tears and softening of eyelids and film until it is a cause of destruction of the eye called tactinir of the eye, and it is cured in four ways: either by cautery with fire; or with sharp medicine as said before in the chapter on cautery; or tactini is done by incision and suture; or by reeds as I will say.
And so it is fitting that you place the patient's head in your lap; then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand, and if it is turned, it is good; and if not, insert a needle into it in which there is thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with thread above, and this should be — near the margin of the eyelid where the hairs grow — near the hairs, and pull the thread to the upper parts with the eyelid, and turn it with the ray.
And then make an incision on the inner part of the lower eyelid near the hairs, cutting with a spatula from the larger tear duct to the smaller one; and then extract the bile and place small cotton or cloth pads under the eyelid, and then mark above the eyelid with ink, and let it be in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that the shape be according to the amount of elevation of the eyelid, for this varies among men, as there are those who need a large amount to be cut from the eyelid according to how much the eyelid is softened.
And then cut with the spatula along the two lines which you have marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct. And let your incision be close to the natural hairs, about the thickness of a grain of rye.
And then put the hook in one of the two corners of the skin, and then flay it all, and then join the two lips of the cut with thin wool thread or gut, and wipe away the blood, and make adhere what is left of the threads over the two eyebrows with some sticky substances, if you want to do this, and if not, don't worry about it.
And then leave the suture of the threads for three or four days, and then treat it.
And if you want, leave the wound without suture, and treat it with something that dries and constricts, for the eyelid is raised towards the sealing of the wound and the aggregation of light; but suture is better. And so this is what the ancients said about eyelid surgery.
But in any case, be attentive to the patient, and it is a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
And there is another way in eyelid surgery, and it is that you mark on the eyelid a shape like a myrtle leaf, and then lift the eyelid with three hooks separated and brought together in this form:
But if it is not possible to hold the hooks, and this is not equal, then take a needle with thread and put it in the middle of the shape, and insert the other thread near the larger tear duct, and the second thread near the smaller tear duct, and join the threads between your fingers equally, and then with these lift your hand with equal elevation, lift all the skin on which is marked as we have recounted.
And then join the two lips of the wound with suture, and treat it until it is healed.
But if swelling occurs near your incision or your cut, calm that swelling with wax plaster and similar things, and with ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid that its hairs are turned inward, then it is necessary that you use on it what we have said about incision; but suture in each case is more skillful.
Eyelid surgery with reeds is in this form: and it is that you turn the eyelid and cut the shape that is inside as I have recounted; and then skillfully make two reeds or two thin splints whose length is according to the length of the eyelid and whose width is less than the width of the spatula. And you have already cut in the extremities of each part, where you hold the threads.
Then gather each with subtlety over what is excess of the eyelid of the eye, and constrict the reeds of each part with strong tightening, and leave it for some days, for the skin by the tightening will die and will be denied and will rot until it falls off by itself.
But if it is delayed, then cut it with scissors, and then treat the wound until it is healed.
Thus when it is solidified, the eyelid is raised and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of two reeds which you will make according to this form: and it should have the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12
On removing sharp hairs from the eye with a needle when the hair is hard.
When there are unnatural, hard, rough, and sharp hairs in the eyes, then the operation is that you take a fine needle and thread it with fine silk thread, and then you join the ends and tie each one in a very subtle manner. And the length of the threads should be about one palm.
And then you compose another fine thread below it shortly, and tie the ends of it if you want.
And then have the patient rest their head on your lap, and be near the sun so that your work is clear, because it is a subtle and small operation.
And then insert the needle at the root of the gathered hair which needs to be removed, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you extract it above the natural hair.
And then pull the hair up and insert it into the alixati (possibly a type of tool or treatment), and let there be one or two or three hairs and no more.
And then pull your hand with it until the hair is expelled with the alixolati in the eyelid with the natural hair.
But if the alixalati is pulled and the hair is not expelled, you will pull the alixati to the lower parts with the thread which you have composed with it, until the alixalati is expelled from the upper hole.
And examine it with the vision of the eye, because then you will expel the alixati and the thread, and rub each and close the eye, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is shorter, then you add a long hair from the natural hairs, and it is raised with that, or you leave it until it is lengthened after some time, and then you remove it.
Chapter 13
On the treatment of ehacratir (possibly a condition) which comes in the upper eyelid.
When ehacratir comes to the eye, and it is a contraction of the eyelid when it is contracted upwards, or to the right or left side, due to poor healing of a wound or incision or cauterization, and it is called leporine, and this ahercrati is either natural or accidental, and is caused by the healing of a wound or incisions or cauterization, or by similar poorly treated conditions.
But the manner of the operation on it is that you split that healed area and separate its edges, and place between them a strip of linen cloth, and bind them until they are healed.
And it is not appropriate that you use for its treatment things which dry out, constrict; because if you do this, the alixacratir returns worse than it ever was before.
Use on it things that soften such as fenugreek, and soak with water in which marshmallow and flaxseed are cooked, or diachylon ointment, which is liquefied with some of the oils, and submerge the strip in it, and treat with that.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you strive with all skill that it not be healed according to the form it was at the beginning.
And this operation which we have described is nothing but some rectification of ehalixacrati so that it does not return to the form of the place as it was before.
Chapter 14.
On the treatment of ehacrati which is made in the lower eyelid.
This alxacrati which is made in the lower eyelid, which is truly called alxacrati; and some of it is natural, other accidental.
But accidental is made by wound or by cut or by cautery or by other similar things.
And the way of the operation is that you take a needle in which there is a double thread, and stick it in the flesh, and make it pass from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
And then extend the flesh to the upper parts with the needle and sew it with the needle, and cut with a wide spatula. And so if the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good; and if not, take the ray and place it in the split figure, and with that turn the eyelid, and make two fissures in the side of the lower eyelid.
And let the extremities of the two fissures be from two angles of the incision, which you have made until they meet, and let an angle be made from them until when they come together a figure is made of them.
And this figure is a Greek letter: the lambda.
And then remove that flesh by the quantity that is the sharp side below it, that which follows the eyelid.
And then join the separated parts and sew them with the wool thread; and then treat them with what we have said of softening medicines and poultices until it is healed.
And if alxacrati occurs by fissure or suture or cautery, then it is appropriate that you split with a flat fissure over the hairs of the eyelid as previously described. And then separate with the poultice between two lips as we have said.
In the summary of the discourse on the treatment of alxacrati when it is above or below, that runs in the operation, according to how it is prepared from the form of alxacrati, and that is in the form of many diversities.
And the wise craftsman always prepares a device in each way which is possible to him until he makes the figure return to the natural form, or close to it, and that patient according to what is convenient to him of the operation and of the instruments in the major dispositions.
Chapter 15.
On the adherence of the eyelid with the conjunctiva or with the cornea.
When this consolidation happens to many men so that the upper eyelid is solidified with the white of the eye, and is prohibited from the ease of movement and its natural works, then it is appropriate that you introduce the extremity of the ray under the eyelid, and raise it up, or extend it with the hook.
And then you cut the adherence with a subtle spatula, which should not be with sharpness of incisions, rather slightly blunt so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and move the spatula so that it does not harm the eye with its sharpness.
And let your incision be almost skinning that adherence with ease until the eyelid is returned according to its natural form and all the adherence is healed.
And then you put salt water in the eye with which you wash; or distill in it zunia dissolved in water.
And then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a linen poultice, and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye, and after the third day use consolidating things until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
On the incision of the nail and the eminence of flesh from the tear ducts.
Know that the nail is of two types, for it is either nervous, and is similar to a hard, subtle ciphac; or it is non-nervous, similar to congealed white humidity, which when iron touches it, or is forced to take it with a hook, is cut off and the hook is not fixed in it.
And both species do not start except from the major tear duct until it gradually covers the sight and prohibits the light and movement of the eye.
But the manner of working in the incision of it is that the patient rests his head on your lap, and then opens his eyes, and you raise the eyelid with your hand, and then collect the nail with a hook of little duplication and extend it to the upper parts. And then take a needle and insert in it a horse hair or ox or cow hair, or similar, or strong thread, or double the end of the needle little by little and fix it in the middle of the nail, and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with thread; and extend it to the upper parts, and scrape with the hair the side of the nail which follows the pupil. And thus you follow it with the hair to the back of it.
And then you cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a subtle spatula or with small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct so that by cutting it, a continuous flow of tears does not occur.
And sometimes the nail with the sole hook extended or with thread, as we have said, and then be scraped with a smooth spatula of which this is its form:
And be careful that with the spatula you do not touch the corneal tunic and that rupture occurs in it, and that the pupil is perforated.
After the incision, throw in the eye a little crushed salt or cief made of bloodletting, and leave it until the next day; and then treat it with what is suitable until it is healed.
And if the nail is not nervous and you cannot insert the needle, nor is the hook fixed in it, then many times this species of nail is cured with medicines, and is healed as I have recounted in the division.
And if you want to cut it, then you open the patient's eye and take a subtle smooth spatula of weak sharpness according to this form: with subtlety. And if you see that it is rarefied and has fled and takes root in it, then distill from your mouth into the eye cief made of bloodletting or with red cief or with crushed salt, and close the eye until the next day.
And then repeat the operation on it until all of it is removed, unless there is a hot abscess in the eye, for then you leave it, and treat the abscess at the beginning until it is healed.
And then repeat your operation on it with reason until it is healed.
The eminence of the tear duct flesh, if it harms the eye greatly, should be suspended with a hook; and cut off a part of it, and do not finish the incision so that a flow of tears does not occur.
And then distill red cief and bloodletting into the tear duct until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
On the incision of alguazardenic and of that which is born of flesh joined in the eye.
Sometimes in the eyes of some, red flesh is born, and it is placed over until it covers the pupil, or approaches or presses on the eyelids and strongly compresses the eyelids to the outer parts and resembles a pomegranate flower.
But the operation on it is that the patient rests his head in your lap; and then open his eyes and collect all that flesh with hooks suitable for this, and hold it with forceps or tweezers; and then cut the flesh at the beginning until all is finished with the scalpel, and be careful of the eye that you do not damage it during your operation.
And let your incision with which you cut those be either with a spatula which we have described in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors with which the growth is collected according to the form that will come after this chapter.
Therefore when your incision is complete and all that flesh is removed, then fill the eye with ground salt, or drip red powder and similar corrosive medicines into it, and place cotton with egg white on the outside of the eye until it is secured from hot inflammation.
And if any cause of alguardenici remains and hot blood dominates, and you fear hot inflammation, then leave the eye and cure that inflammation with what reduces that inflammation, and then repeat the operation on it until it is healed, and similarly do for the joined flesh which occurs in the eye of this type.
But however, it is fitting that you avoid all curing of the weak eye by natural or accidental means, working with iron, and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that that member is able to endure that operation.
Chapter 18.
On the collection of sabel in the eye.
Sabel are red veins which are woven over the eye and prohibit its operation of sight, and weaken the eye with length of days.
Therefore it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the eye in which there is sabel is strong and in it there is no other malady than sabel, then you collect that sabel.
And it is that you command the patient to rest his head in your lap, and then suspend those veins with one hook or with two according to your judgment; and let that hook be of subtle duplication according to this form:
or they are two hooks gradually in one body according to this form:
And then let those veins be collected with subtle forceps, with subtlety, and wipe away the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins to be removed from the eye and are rolled back.
And take care that you do not damage the eye with the extremities of the spatula; and let your operation be at midday before the sun, and be very firm in your operation that you do not cut except those veins.
And when you have completed, then you drip green or red cief into the eye so that with its sharpness it corrodes what remains of the sabel.
But if that is not possible for you to collect all in that hour, then you plaster all with that which reduces its pain, and leave it for some days until its pain is settled and it is secured from hot inflammation.
And then repeat on it in the same manner until it is healed.
And this is the form of the scissors:
Chapter 19.
On the reduction of arizati to the nose.
When you cure arizati with cautery or with sharp burning medicine as described in the preceding account of it and it is not healed, then there is no other solution but to cut into the abscess towards its maturity, and extract all the humidity which is in it and the pus until the bone is exposed.
And then when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then you scrape it with an instrument of which this is the form:
And it is called a rough head, and is made of Indian iron, and the head is round like asir which is made punctated by punctation of a file or aliskalfati by subtle punctation (as shown in the following form).
And place that on the corrupted part of the bone, and then revolve it between your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And this should be done several times, and afterwards restore the place with drying and astringent substances.
Then if the place is consolidated and good flesh has grown in it and the flow of pus is stopped for 40 days, and it is not renewed and does not form an abscess and no accident occurs in it, then you know that it is healed.
And if not, then there is no solution but to reduce the fissure to the shape of the nose, in this manner: that you uncover the second bone with iron or with sharp medicine, and when the bone is uncovered, then you take a drill of this form:
Let the extremity of the iron be triangular, and its shaft be thin and tapered to the extremity as you see here.
And then place that on the bone, and let it be near the lacrimal; and move your hand a little from the eye, and then revolve your hand with the drill until it penetrates all the bone, and the patient feels this because he finds wind coming out when he holds his hand.
Then restore the place with astringent drying medicines as I have taught you.
Then when flesh grows and the place is hardened, then the matter which was flowing to the outer parts returns to the nose, so this is easier for the patient.
Chapter 20.
On the reduction of the protrusion of the eye.
When the eye protrudes in its entirety and no harm or diminution occurs in the vision, then it is appropriate that you relax the patient, and then that you follow him, and then that you place cups on the neck without scarification and suck with good suction; and then place on the eye a liniment which is made of acacia and aloe and incense and sarcocolla, and then tighten the plaster on the eye with many cloths.
And the manner of the cloths is that you take many clean linen cloths, and each cloth should be folded in four pleats; and make many of these.
And then place them one on top of the other according to the quantity which the eye needs. And then tighten over them with a hard cloth with strong constriction; and repeat the cups with suction without scarification; and then remove the cups and leave the eye tightened for the day and night.
But if meanwhile the binding is softened, then it should be very tightly bound.
And then remove the binding after the day and night as we have said.
And if you see the eye has already been reduced, it is good, and if not, then repeat the plaster with the cloths and the constriction and the cups until it is healed.
Chapter 21
On the incision of the protrusion of the uveal tunic.
When a disruption occurs in the uveal tunic, and afterwards it protrudes and comes out of the eyelids like a grape, and the shape of the eye is distorted because of this, and you want to cut it, then the operation on it is as we have described, that you insert the needle at the root of the uvea from the lower part to the upper part, and then put another needle with a double thread from the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate and leave the first needle according to its position; and then cut the place of the double thread and lift with it the part of the uvea in the circle of the needle, and tighten it a lot.
And then extract the needle and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye and leave it until the thread falls off with the uvea.
And then treat the eye with something that comforts it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes gather from all parts with a circle of cloth until the eye gathers a large protrusion, and then let it be perforated with a thin spatula that comes to the depth of the eye, and let the albuminous fluid run, and the eye descends and enters immediately.
And then tighten until it is healed.
Chapter 22
On the treatment of alconati.
This disease that is called alconati is nothing but pus which is gathered in the eye resembling descending water and is not that.
But the manner of working on it is that you make the patient sit on the prepared and upright chair, and then take his head in your hands from both sides and move it until you see the pus reach the lower parts, and then let it be dried and not descend, and let the light be removed, and the patient see things as he saw.
And if it does not descend downwards, know that it is water.
But if the descent is not prepared for the pus with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands and then take a thin spatula and split with it over the sifting membrane a little towards the continuation of the conjunctiva with the corneal tunic in the crown (up to the empty place), until the pus is expelled.
Therefore when it is expelled, then you instill in the eye hot water in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then let it be treated with other things until it is healed.
Chapter 22
On the treatment of water descending from the eye.
We have already spoken of the types of water in the division and which is suitable to perforate with a declaring speech, then that according to health.
Then it is appropriate that you make the patient sit between your hands on a square and bind his healthy eye, very tightly.
And then place near the eyelid of his eye your left hand, if the eye in which the water is is the left eye; or with your right hand, if the eye is the right one.
And then with your right hand take the needle, if the eye is left; or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
And then place the tip of the needle near the crown through the thickness of the ray in the white of the eye from the part of the lesser lacrimal, and then push the needle with strength and turn your hand with it.
And then penetrate into the white of the eye and feel that the needle has already reached an empty cause.
And it is appropriate that the measure of the path of the needle to the depth be the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness, and is the crown of the eye; for you will see with that pupil with the vision of the eye through the clarity of the corneal tunic.
And then place the needle up to the place where the water is, and then you draw it down once after another, and therefore if the water descends immediately, then you see the patient that on which he opens his sight immediately, and the needle in his eye.
And then rest a little; when the water has descended, then you remove it again before the almond is thrown out.
And when it is dried and does not descend, then you extract the almond with ease, and rotate it with your hand little by little, and then dissolve in water a little clear salt of gem and with that wash the eye inside; and then put outside the eye cotton or tow or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white and bind with that the healthy eye.
But we and those of our time put over it ground cumin with egg white.
And if the almond does not obey you when entering the eye due to its hardness — because there are some men whose eye is very hard —, then it is necessary that you take the spatula which is called alberid, of which this is the form:
And then perforate with it that conjunction, and do not push your hand into the hole, and it is only so that you make a subtle way for the almond.
And then introduce the almond as we have said.
And for the completion of your work, a decent sleeping place should be prepared for the patient in which he sleeps on his back in a dark house, and he should be prohibited from all movements.
And put in his nature that by which his nature may be soothed, and do not move his head to the right or left side at all.
And let the bandage be according to its disposition until the third day.
And then untie it in that dark house and test the weak sight, and make him see some things, and then return the bandage until the 7th day.
And it is not appropriate that you do this at the time of the treatments or immediately after the infusion. Rather, it is appropriate that you alienate this so that the water can lightly rise through great and vehement regard.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary that you untie the eye before the 7th day, and rectify it with that which reduces the abscess.
Then you free his sight and put over his face a veil by which his vision may be guided below for some days, he being in the dark house.
And then let him be gradually removed from that house and converse in his affairs.
And know that in alchatea the disciple is not excused from vision sometimes, and then you be bold in the operation.
And it has already come to us from some of those who are in Artach, and some said that it was done in Ayrac magdaam perforated with which the water is sucked.
But however I have not seen anyone in our land who has perfected this, nor have I read this in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is new.
And these are the forms of the species of magdaan so that he who ignores them may be over them:
And let them be made of copper or iron properly, and let their extremities be with this triangular subtlety, the sharp extremity as that is the form.
Chapter 24.
On the treatment of flesh born in the nose.
When in the nose are born diverse flesh joined of which there is something which is assembled like a scorpion of many feet, or like an octopus fish; and this disease is called polypus because it is in the likeness of that fish represented. And of it is cancerous flesh, flat, of dark color; and of it is that it is lion flesh not of dark color.
So in that which is in these lion flesh not fraudulent nor cancerous, it is appropriate that you make the patient sit between your hands and placed in the sun, and open his nostrils, and prick your nail into those flesh. And then extract that to the outside parts, and then cut what you have grasped of those with a sharp, subtle spatula from one part until you know that all the flesh has already been removed; that if any of it remains of which the removal is possible, then you scrape that with one of the subtle instruments with ease until none of it remains. But if it dominates with blood or hot apostema, then you apply to it what is appropriate; or if it is of malignant apostemas, then you cook and cauterize it until the blood is removed and all the cavities are eliminated.
And afterwards, pour into the nose after the incision vinegar and water or wine. But if the nose is open and humidity proceeds from it to the palate, then know that it is already healed.
But if the humidity does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside it flesh has grown in the highest bones of the nostrils to which the removal has not reached.
Therefore then it is appropriate that you introduce a thread to which there is some thickness, and tie many knots in it, and place between each knot the quantity of a finger or less, and instruct the patient and insert one end of the thread into the nostril with the ray or with another thing which is possible for him.
And after that has been done, let him inhale his odor until it reaches the channels of the nostrils, and comes out above his throat, for many times children in schools do something similar to this action, and it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it.
And afterwards place the two ends of the thread, one end that comes out above the nose and the other that remains in the nose, and afterwards administer sawdust of flesh with the knots that are in the thread, and do this until you know that the flesh is already with the knots of the thread.
And afterwards extract the thread, and place in the nose after the abstraction of blood a plug, and do this for three days or more until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
And afterwards at the end of the matter, place in the nose a lead cannula for some days until it is healed.
But if it needs a cure that dries out, use that.
And this is the form of the instrument for making head purgatives with which oils and medicines are distilled in the nose:
And make this of silver or brass, which is similar to a small open lamp, just like a small basin, and the passage similarly.
And if you want, make a closed cannula just like a cane, and the cannula of the instrument for making head purgatives and let it be flat, uncovered; to which there is a handle in the back of it, with which you hold it when you heat oil in it or what you want of the juices and of the suckable things.
Chapter 25.
Of moles born in the extremities of the nose.
Many times a mole is born in the extremities of the nose, and it is magnified and increased in some days until its appearance is very ugly.
And for this it is appropriate that you cut it at the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate all of it. And afterwards place on the location either cautery or burning medicine which stays in place of it.
But if its incision is delayed until it is magnified, then consider if it is stony, hard, of dark color and of little feeling, then do not touch it with iron because it is a cancerous apostema; for many times to one who cuts this apostema it happens that through it great malice comes upon the one who had it.
And if the apostema is of soft touch and is not of dark color, and you see that incision is possible in all of it, then evacuate the patient and cut it without fear, and cure the location with that which dries out and constricts until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
On suturing the nose, lips, and ear when continuity is disrupted by wound or similar.
Know that when a break in continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, it contributes little to that operation except in some men.
Therefore, when something like this happens to someone, consider if it's a fresh wound with its blood, and then join the two edges of the wound with sutures, and afterwards treat it until it heals.
And if the edges of the break in continuity are already separated, and each has become healed, then you should scrape each part of its visible skin until blood comes out. And afterwards join the two edges with sutures and tighten them, and sprinkle dragon's blood and ground incense over them, and place a piece of diaphoenicon plaster, or some other consolidative plaster, over the powder, and leave it bound for two or three days, and afterwards unbind it and change the plaster and leave it until the threads fall out by themselves, and afterwards treat with ointment until it heals.
But the manner of suturing is that you close the break in continuity either with needles as we have described in the suturing of the belly, or close the break in continuity with thread as you have been taught.
Chapter 27.
On extraction of those things that come in the two lips in the inner parts.
Many times it happens to many men in the inner parts of their lips some hard swellings similar to vetch seeds, and some of them are smaller and some are larger.
Therefore you should turn the lips and cut each of those hard spots from all sides, and after the excision fill the place with ground fat until the blood is stopped, and afterwards wash it with vinegar and treat the place with something astringent, until it heals.
Chapter 28.
On incision of flesh added to the gums.
Many times flesh grows on the gum which the ancients called albulus, so you should suspend it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut it towards its root, and let the pus or blood flow.
And afterwards place ground fat or other astringent or drying powders on the spot.
And if that flesh returns, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it, for after cauterization it will not return.
Chapter 29.
On scraping teeth with iron.
When on the surface of the teeth of the inner and outer parts and between the gums rough, ugly scales are gathered, and sometimes they are blackened and become yellow or green until corruption comes to the gum because of this and the teeth become ugly.
And so you should have the patient sit between your hands and place his head in your lap, and scrape the teeth on which those scales and things like sand appear until none of it remains, and do this for the blackness and the yellowness and the others until they are cleaned.
So if what is on them from the beginning of the scraping is removed, it is good; and if not, then you repeat the scraping on them the next day and the second and the third until it comes to the final state that you want.
And know that teeth need many scrapers of diverse forms and many shapes according to what is prepared for your operation. And because the scraper with which the tooth is scraped from the inner part is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth according to other forms, and these forms of scrapers should be prepared by you which you will see soon:
Chapter 30
On the extraction of teeth.
It is advisable that you treat the tooth for its pain with all skill and delay any extraction of it, for there is nothing that can replace it once it is extracted, as it is a sublime substance until there is justification for its extraction.
But when the patient is forced to have that tooth extracted, you must be firmly certain which is the painful tooth, for many times the pain deceives the patient and they think it is in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one and afterwards the pain does not cease until the diseased and painful tooth is extracted, for we have already seen this through the work of barbers.
Therefore, when you are certain which is the painful tooth, and you know it well, then you should scarify around the tooth with a spatula which has some virtue, until it is separated from the gum on all sides, and afterwards move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps at the beginning little by little until you loosen it.
And afterwards, place strong, large forceps on it for a good grip or strong hold, and place the patient's head between your knees so that you hold it well and it doesn't move, and then pull the tooth straight out in a way that you don't break it, nor cause the patient greater pain.
And if it is not thrown out, then take one of those instruments, and place it beneath it on all sides with ease and attempt its removal as was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is hollow or decayed, then you should fill that hole with cloth and tighten it with the end of a fine rod so that it is not broken at the time of your constriction on it with forceps.
And you should work carefully with scarification around all parts of the gum and be very careful with your strength that you don't break it and leave a part of it, and return to the patient due to the harm that may be greater than their first pain.
And be careful not to do what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and audacity in their extractions, without administering what we have recounted; for many times they bring great illnesses upon men which are more difficult to be broken, and all their roots remain, or some of them, or that you extract it with some bones of the jaw as we have often testified.
And after its extraction, the mouth should be washed with hot wine or vinegar with salt.
And if bleeding occurs because of this, as often happens, then crush some quantity of zegi and sprinkle it over the wound, and if that zegi doesn't help, cauterize.
The shape of the forceps and fine pliers with which the tooth is moved at the beginning should be of long extremity, with a short and thick handle, so that they are not bent when you must work with them.
And they should be as you see with a thick handle so that when you tighten with them they are not bent, with short extremities.
And they should be made of Indian iron, decently made with straight extremities, and at their extremities should be teeth of which some enter into the others and tighten by strong decent constriction, and sometimes their extremities should be in the shape of the beak of a bird which is called ciconia, that is stork, and they are of strong constriction.
Chapter 31.
On the removal of teeth and extraction of bones from broken jaws.
When you must remove a tooth which is broken and some part remains, then you should place cotton with butter on the spot for a day or two until the area is softened; and afterwards introduce pliers or forceps whose tips resemble the beak of a bird called stork or crane, the shape of the forceps:
Their tips should be made inside like a file or rasp.
And if it doesn't come out with these forceps or pliers, then you should dig around the root and uncover all the flesh and introduce the instrument called atali, which is a small lever whose shape is this:
And it should have a short, slightly thick end, and not be beveled so that it doesn't break.
So if by this the root is extracted, good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments of which these are the forms: the shape of the first instrument is of triangular tip in which there is some thickness:
The shape of the second instrument is that it should be of triangular and more subtle tip.
And I have already been helped with this instrument having two prongs of which this is the form after the following: and with other instruments which preceded in scraping of teeth; for help is made with this instrument which resembles a large hook, and this is the shape:
of the triangular tip curved or short, which should have some thickness, and not be beveled so that it doesn't break.
And furthermore know that there are many dental instruments and similarly other instruments.
But the wise and subtle artisan in the art finds for himself according to what the operation and diverse diseases signify to him; for there are diseases for which the ancients did not speak of nor set a proper instrument, due to the forms of diverse species.
But if the jawbone or other bones of the mouth are broken, or if they rot, then let it be treated carefully in its place with what is convenient of the instruments and forceps which we have mentioned in the extraction of tooth roots, and help yourself with a tool of which this is the shape:
And let there be some thickness in it little by little, and let it be tightened or held with the mouth so that it doesn't escape or flee until the bone is completely removed; and afterwards restore the place with medicines suitable for this.
But if there is a small rottenness in the bone, then scrape it of that rottenness and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
On the treatment of teeth protruding above the others.
When the teeth are protruding not according to their natural course, their shape is ugly, and especially when it happens to women, and especially to venerable maidens; so it is fitting that you consider: if a tooth is born next to another tooth, and it is not possible to close or align it, then uproot it; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then you cut it with this instrument of which this is the shape; and it is similar to a pig's snout, and should be made of Indian iron with a very sharp tip.
And let your cutting with which you cut it be over many days due to the hardness of the tooth, and so that no other tooth is disturbed.
And if it is a protruding tooth exposed to filing, then file it with an Indian iron file of which this is the shape:
And let it all be of Indian iron and the handle likewise; and let it be of many small points just like a file with which needles are made, with which the tooth should be filed little by little over many days with ease, so that no other tooth is disturbed and falls. And afterwards smooth it at the end, and scrape it with some razors.
And if it is a tooth of which a part is broken and hurts the tongue, then it is fitting that you file it until the roughness of that fracture is removed and evened out, and it is smoothed so that the tongue is not hurt nor the speech corrupted.
Chapter 33.
On restoring loose teeth with gold or silver wire.
When the front teeth become loose due to impact or falling, and the patient cannot bite on what they eat, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and your treatment has not worked, then so that they don't fall out, it is ingenious to fasten them with gold wire and not silver, because silver turns green and then rots after some days, but gold never changes.
And let the wire be of such fineness and thickness that it can enter between the teeth; and the form of the repair is that you take the wire and take double of it between two healthy teeth, and then increase with two twists of the wire between two loose ones, whether one or many, until the thread reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the weaving until the part where you began, and tighten your hand with ease and wisdom until it is not loose.
And let your tightening with which you tighten the wire be towards the roots of the teeth so that it doesn't escape.
And then cut the excess ends of the wire with forceps or scissors, and gather them in each place with gestures, and turn them and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth, so that they don't injure the tongue. And then leave it thus tightened as it remains.
But if it is untied or broken, tighten it or them with another wire in such a manner for all its time.
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the repair of two healthy teeth and two loose ones, as you see these tied:
And when it happens that one tooth or two return after the falling of each in their places, and they are regrown as we have recounted, and that they remain.
And only a good and wise craftsman does this.
And sometimes something is adapted from cow bones, and is made from them in the form of a tooth, and is placed in the place where the tooth is missing, and is tightened as we have said, and remains and serves with that for a long time.
Chapter 34.
On cutting the ligament which comes in the tongue and prohibits speech.
This ligament which comes under the tongue sometimes is natural with which a man is born, or accidental and happens due to a wound which has already healed.
And the operation on it is that you open the mouth of the patient, their head being in your lap; and raise their tongue, and then cut that nervous ligament according to its width until the tongue is freed from its retention.
But if in it there is any hardness or knot, and this has been due to the healing of a wound, then you throw a hook and cut it across its width until you have cut the ligament and the knot is dissolved.
And take care that a fissure is not made in the depth of the flesh and that you don't cut an artery there and cause a flow of blood.
And afterwards let the trace of the incision be washed with rosewater or with vinegar or with cold water; and then place under the tongue a wick; that is, a bandage which the patient should hold under the tongue each night so that it doesn't heal again.
But if a flow of blood occurs, place crushed vitriol on the place; but if the blood wins, then cauterize the place with a lentil-shaped cautery which is suitable for this. And after that, treat with other things until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
On the extraction of a ranula under the tongue.
Sometimes a swelling occurs under the tongue resembling a small growth, preventing the tongue from its natural operation; and it can quickly grow until it fills the mouth.
And the procedure for it is to open the mouth of the patient sitting in front of the sun and examine the swelling.
And if you see it is dark or black in color, hard, which the patient cannot feel, then do not touch it because it is cancer.
And if it is inclined to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then you put the hook in it, and cut it with a fine spatula, and cut it from all sides; and if blood comes during your operation, then you place crushed vitriol on it until the blood is stopped.
And then return to your work until you have removed it completely, until it is washed with vinegar and salt; and treat it with the other cure for this until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
On the extraction of swellings from the two glands and of that which is born in the throat and of other swellings.
When they occur in the throat, these are glands which are like cotton, which happen outside and are called two ears, which when you treat them with what we have said in the division and it is not healed, then you consider if the swelling is hard, of dark color, with little feeling, then do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red in color and the root is thick, then do not touch it with iron because of the blood flow; instead leave it until it is mature, and then either you will pierce it, or it will break on its own.
And if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin, then it is appropriate to be cut.
And the operation on it is that you consider, before your operation, if the swelling has already rested from its heat with complete rest or if it has diminished with some reduction; and then make the patient sit in front of the sun, and their head should be in your lap, and open their mouth, and the servant taking between his hands should press their tongue down with a very noble instrument of which this is the form:
And it should be made of silver or brass, and be thin like a knife.
So when you press the tongue with it and the swelling is shown to you, and your gaze falls upon it, then take a hook and fix it in the almond, and pull it to the outside parts as much as you can. Besides this, pull something from the membranes, and then cut it with an instrument of which this is the form:
Besides this, pull something from the membranes, and then cut it with an instrument of which this is the form: and it is like forceps, but its extremities are curved, so that the orifice of each of them is in the direction of the other, very sharp, which should be of blue-dyed iron.
But if this instrument is not present to you, then cut it with a spatula of which this is its form: And it should be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And after you have cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same manner of incision, and after the incision the patient should gargle with cold water
But if blood flow occurs, gargle water of decoction of pomegranate peel or myrtle leaf and similar to that of astringent things until the blood flow is restricted, and then cure it until it is healed.
And sometimes other swellings are born in the throat besides those two glands, and cut those according to what I have said in the cutting of two tonsils equally.
And I have already treated a woman for a swelling which was born in her throat, which swelling tended to a dark color, of little feeling, which had already closed her throat, and the woman was breathing with a narrow passage, and it had already prohibited her from eating and drinking water, and she had already come to death if it had remained for one more day or two.
And the swelling had already grown so much that it had put two branches until they came out through two holes.
Therefore I hurried carefully and stuck in one of their nails, and pulled it, and a large portion was pulled from it, and then I cut that from where I understood the other hole, and then I opened its mouth, and compressed its tongue, and then I stuck the nail in that abscess.
And then I cut off a large part of it, and only a little blood ran from it. Therefore the throat of that woman was freed, and she immediately began to drink water, and then took food, so I did not cease to cut that abscess many times for a long time, and an abscess succeeded in place of that one, which I cut until it was prolonged.
Therefore I ingeniously had and cauterized its throat, so it stopped from addition; and then I walked around and did not know what God did with that after me.
Chapter 37.
On cutting the uvula when it is swollen.
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it is swollen and long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a bubble.
But when it is cured with what we have said in the division, and your cure does not work, and likewise you already see that the hot swelling has already been removed from it and it is subtle, then it is appropriate that you cut that which is gathered round; and if it has that length, and is bloody, of dark color or black, and has no feeling, then it is appropriate that you attempt to cut it, because in that there is fear for the patient.
And when you see that according to the manner that I have said of its whiteness and length, that you make the patient sit and press his tongue with an instrument whose form proceeded and then stick the nail in the uvula, and pull it down and cut it with one of two instruments which are mentioned in the cutting of two tonsils.
And it is appropriate that you do not cut it except what is added above the natural term without addition, because if you cut more of it, you will harm his speech.
And after the cutting, use what we have recounted in the cutting of two tonsils, and cure it until it is healed.
But if the patient was frightened by cutting it, it is appropriate to use ingenuity in cauterizing it without fear, and the manner of cautery in it is only with sharp water, and it is that you place the head of the patient in your lap, and then press his tongue with the instrument which we have mentioned, and then take the water which we have mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and mix quicklime with it, and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of the instrument of which this is the form:
Let the extremity of it be a concavity in which the medicine is placed just as the concavity of a ray spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula, and the patient lies on his side so that saliva or mucus runs from his mouth through the intrinsic medicine, so that nothing of it descends on his throat and harms it.
And then hold your hand with the medicine, and press it on the uvula for the space of half an hour until you see it become blackened and sedated by the biting of the medicine.
And if you want, take cotton and wrap it on the extremity of the ray, and submerge the cotton in the medicine, and introduce the ray with the cotton in a cannula from above until the cotton adheres in that cannula, and do this so many times until you achieve what you want of the cauterization of the uvula, and then leave it because it will dry and fall after three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it, and after the cauterization wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter, and clean with it what is around it of the medicine, and let it be washed with cold water, and let it be cured outside with embrocation, and inside with gargles until it is healed.
And this kind of cure is safer than cutting and further from fear.
Sometimes the uvula is cured with something more subtle than cautery and incision, for it is cured with fumigation in this manner: take calament, hyssop, origanum, rue, Arabic sticados, chamomile, bruised and similar to those herbs, and add all these things, or some of them, in a pot, and let them be submerged in vinegar, and boil; and let the pot be well sealed with proper luting, and let there be in the middle of the pot a hole, over which is placed a concave instrument of copper in this manner; let it be made of silver or copper.
And let the extremity be introduced into the mouth of the patient until the vapor rises to the uvula over the cannula, until the uvula is very darkened.
And afterwards repeat over it many times until it is dry, and be careful not to do this cure at the beginning of the appearance of abscesses, for it would add too much to the abscess, and it is not appropriate for you to do this, except towards the declaration of the abscess of heat.
But if this instrument is not present to you, then take a cane and compose at its extremity an eggshell, so that the mouth of the patient is not burned, for the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this cure is good with health.
Chapter 38.
Of extraction of thorns and of that which adheres in the throat and of other things.
Many times there adheres in the throat either a fish bone or some other thing.
Then it is appropriate that you extract that which of those is apparent, upon which falls the sight, after you press the tongue with an instrument before the sun, so that to you is declared that which is in the throat.
And that which does not appear and is hidden to you in the throat, it is appropriate that you make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, for very easily the thing attached to the throat will be thrown out by vomit; or let the patient swallow a piece of turnip or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or take a piece of dry sea sponge, and tie it strongly with thread, and afterwards let the patient swallow it, for when it reaches the place where the thorns are, it is extracted, then they are thrown out. And also take an eel and tie it well with thread, and let it be put inside and suddenly extracted; or take a leek and suddenly put it in and suddenly take it out.
But if they are not thrown out with these things which we have said, then use an instrument of lead according to this form:
And let it be a little thicker than a ray, and at its extremity let there be a concavity which you introduce into his throat with ease.
And let him have his head elevated upwards, and be careful of touching his throat bone, so that it reaches the thing and with it that pushes the bone or the thorn, or that the physician does it with his hand.
But however that the patient introduces it is better, for his knowledge of the place of the attached thing and pushes downwards, and pulls his hand with the instrument upwards, all this according to the quantity which is prepared for him until it is thrown out.
Chapter 39.
On the extraction of a leech attached to the throat.
When a leech is treated with what we have said in the division of the cure with medicines and it doesn't work, then examine the patient's throat in the sunlight, after you have compressed their tongue with the instrument we have described to you.
Then if you see the leech, extract it with small tweezers or with subtle gestures decently.
And if it's not possible for you to extract it with that, then take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat, and after that place a hot iron in the cavity of the tube, and do this many times (until the leech is dead and detaches from the throat) and the patient should abstain from water all day.
And afterwards, take a glass full of cold water, and open their mouth in it, and wash the mouth with it; and don't let them swallow any of it and move the water from one hour to the next with their hand, because the leech as soon as it feels the water falls.
But if it is not expelled with what we have described, then fumigate the patient with bugs or with asafoetida through the instrument which we have described for the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, because it will fall.
And there is another way of operation in fumigation of it, which is that you take a pot in which there are burning coals and the pot is covered with a lid in the middle of which there is a hole, and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole; and after that the fumigation should descend; and the patient should put their mouth on the end of the tube, and close their mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, because the leech will fall immediately.
And if it doesn't fall, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and the patient should abstain from drinking, and eat salty things and garlic, and not drink water, and thus it is necessary that with this regimen it be expelled.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps as you see, except that there is some curvature in it: which is put to the throat, and the end of it is similar to a stork's beak, which is wide, in which there is roughness of a file, because, when it compresses something, it doesn't let it go.
Chapter 40.
In which is the sum of the discourse on the opening of abscesses and on their cutting.
Abscesses are of many types, of many kinds, according to what comes to memory of them, of each in this book.
And they are diverse in perforation and cutting of them in two ways, of which one is by the type of abscesses in themselves; and by what they contain of humors.
And the second way is near the places in which they occur in the body, because the abscess occurring in the head is different from the abscess occurring in the buttocks; and the abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from the abscess occurring in a joint; and each of them has its judgment for operation.
And more of abscesses are some which should not be perforated except after maturation of the pus in them or their completion.
There are other abscesses which should be pierced when they are raw, and are not matured according to their completion, such as abscesses that are near to the joints, because when an abscess comes near a joint, its being is prolonged until what is in its circuit rots, and very easily the ligaments or the nerves of that joint are corrupted, wherefore it is made a cause of contraction of that member; or it is an abscess near a principal member, and if you delay the perforation of it until it is matured it will harm the principal member; or it is near the buttocks, so perforate it unmatured; and it is not fitting that you perforate it raw, of uncompleted digestion, except that which is near the buttocks, so that the depth of it does not rot and is elongated to the inner parts of the buttocks, and a fistula is made, or that it is made in its end that it is not healed. It's important that you know the time for perforating the abscess, and this is when it has matured.
And know that it is mature when there is a cessation of pain and fever, and after a reduction in redness and pulsation, and the sharpness of the head of the abscess, and other signs.
And because it's necessary that you know the perforation should be at the lowest point of the abscess and most conducive to healing of the protrusion.
And perforation should always be along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in parts of the hands or feet, and in place of the muscles, the cords of nerves, of arteries; and, lastly, in all equal places where there is no reflection; because in those that are reflected, use perforation according to that member.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy place, then it is better that you leave the perforation of it until the digestion of it is confirmed according to completion, as we have said; because if you perforate it before this, the course of its pus and much filth is prolonged, and very easily its lips and its depth are hardened.
But some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the flesh or body towards necessity, or according to what the member requires.
And it is appropriate that you administer small perforation, and in large abscesses large and wide perforation or many incisions according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses.
And others are of the abscesses in which it is appropriate that the skin be hollowed out and incised, when it is made like bread and made at a term that it already remains, as that which occurs in many boils and buboes.
And of those that are incised with a section having three angles; and of those is in which it is incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as in the abscesses of the groin.
And of them are those in which round incision and lunar incision are administered, and similar to those.
But that which does not have a head as are superficial lion-like abscesses, it is appropriate that you perforate it with superficial perforation, or flat only.
And it is appropriate when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, that you perforate it and do not hurry to extract all the pus at that time; rather extract a part of it, and then seal the abscess until the next day, and then extract a larger part, and then do this many times gradually until it is expelled.
And especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or small child, or old in decrepitude, because the animal spirit is often dissolved with the egress of the pus, and very easily the patient dies, and you lose them.
Therefore guard this chapter with great caution, and after your perforation in which you perforate these abscesses, it is appropriate that you clean the wounds and consider then if the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then you administer the lint of flax or old cotton; and if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then it is appropriate that you place a wick in each hole until they come together.
And if in the abscess a part of the skin is cut off or you have hollowed it out in the circuit, then it is appropriate that you fill it with old cotton or thread made of linen cloth, as when you have drawn out bread or roots, without moisture; and tighten it until the third day; and then proceed with it and treat it with what is appropriate of the ointments until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs at the time of your operation, then you administer cold water and vinegar in which you soak a linen cloth, and place it over the site of the blood flow many times.
But if the blood flow persists, then it is appropriate that you administer treatment and cure and powders which I have recounted in many places of this our book and of division.
But if it is in winter time, and the place of the abscess is a place of many nerves, then it is appropriate that you infuse compresses in hot wine and oil, and place these on the areas.
And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy, then it is appropriate that you place compresses soaked with water and oil or with wine and oil, and all this should be cold until the third day, as we have said, and then it is appropriate that you unbind the abscess and clean it and administer in its treatment what is suitable for it until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary for the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally, but according to the way of distinction I have already spoken of every abscess in what manner is the way of its cure by chapters individually.
Chapter 41.
On the incision of abscesses which come in the skin of the head.
In the skin of the head small abscesses, and they are of species of nodes which contain tunics that are made for them; and their species are many.
And of them are pingas, and of those are those which contain moisture similar to lima. And of those are those which contain moisture similar to dust, and similar to them; and of those are those which are stony, hard.
And in the incision of all, and in their extraction there is no fear, as towards their extraction there is no contrary artery.
And the operation in their incision is that you examine them with an instrument the form of which comes after this, which is called entromes, until you know what it contains.
For if what it contains is moisture, then you cut it with an incision according to the length by superficial incision according to this form:
And begin in the incision of the line of B until the line of G. Then when the moisture is evacuated, then you excise that skin that contains that moisture, and do not leave any of it at all, for many times it returns, if any of it remains.
And after submerge cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present, and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it and leave it until another day, for with this it corrodes all that remains of that little skin.
And after iterate over that cotton with Egyptian ointment secondly and thirdly if you need it, until you are confident that no part of that little skin remains; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodes, then you incise it according to this form: with an incision having the form of a cross, and put hooks between two lips of the incision and peel it from every part, and exert your strength in extracting the tunic which contains it.
But if an artery opposes you, then do what I have recounted to you first.
And similarly do in the petrified abscess of incision and of treatment according to what we have told you; and incision on a petrified abscess is easier, for it is of little blood and of little moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are in the head in some men with whom there is no moisture at all; which thing is because I incised on an abscess in the head of an old woman and found the abscess like a deaf stone, rough, white, which could not be broken, and if someone were struck with it, it would wound them.
But in the other abscesses occurring in the head besides this this chapter is not, such as the abscesses that come to the heads of children and towards the roots of the ears, but the incision of all these should be superficial incision.
And place their perforation on the lowest part of them so that the body of the pus is relieved to the lower parts.
And after treat those with what is suitable to that of treatment.
Chapter 42.
On the cutting of scrofulas which occur in the neck.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck and in the armpits and in the groins; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And these are those that occur in the neck, and there are many that are generated among them, and every scrofula of these is within its own tunic, and just as in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the species of these scrofulas are many, for of these some are stony, and of these are those that contain moisture, and of these are malignant ones which do not yield to treatment.
Therefore in that which you see of good disposition in the Touch, of which the color of what is manifest is close to the color of the skin, and is moved to all parts, and is not attached to the nerve of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and is not deep, it is fitting that you incise it with a superficial cut from the upper part to the lower part of the body from the line of G to the line of B, and flay it from all parts, and extend the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks if you have need of them, as we have said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is more cautious that the vein or nerve not be cut.
And let the spatula not be very sharp, lest it join your hand with a cut, or that it disturb the patient, and that you cut what is not necessary to cut; for if you cut a vein or artery and prohibit yourself from your operation, then place crushed vitriol or other powders which stop blood flow in the wound, and tighten the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess rests and the wound is softened and begins to be putrid. When the blood is stopped.
Then return to your operation until you have completed it.
And afterwards inquire with your index finger if any of the other small scrofulas remain, then cut those and clean them.
And if there is a large vein in the root of the scrofula, it is then fitting that you do not cut that scrofula from its root. Rather, it is fitting that you tie it with strong doubled thread and that you leave it until it falls by itself without harm.
And afterwards fill the wound with old cotton which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment, and afterwards treat it.
And if you cut that whole scrofula, then it is fitting that you join the two lips of the wound and sew immediately since no superfluity has remained there.
But if you see that superfluity has remained due to the size of the scrofula, it is fitting that you intend to cut its root, and extract it and administer suture and what is said.
And that of the scrofulas which contain moisture, perforate it with superficial perforation there where the place of its maturation appears to you, and place perforation of what follows the lowest of the body, as we have said.
And afterwards administer perforation, cauterize with ointment and similar to those, so that it may corrode what remains of the corruption. And afterwards when you see the wound already to be cleaned, then you treat it with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
On cutting the growth of an abscess occurring inside the throat.
The ancients spoke of this incision in the epiglottis, and no one in our land has been seen to have done it.
And this is the transcription of their discourse.
But in men having quinsy, it is fitting that the extraction of the epiglottis be avoided, as it does not provide help because all the veins and major ones of the patient are there.
But in those who have hot abscesses in the mouth or throat or both ears, when the disease is not in the windpipe, it is fitting to use the cutting of the epiglottis to avoid the loss which is caused by suffocation.
Therefore it is fitting when we want this, that we cut the epiglottis below three circles of the circles of the epiglottis, or four with a small incision for the width in that which is between two circles by quantity, so that the cut is in the membrane, not in the cartilage, and this place is suitable for cutting, because it is devoid of flesh and its blood vessels are far away.
And if the physician is fearful, it is fitting then that he stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, and afterwards split the skin until he reaches the canal, but avoid the blood vessels if you see any of them.
And afterwards cut the membrane as we have recounted; and it is indicated above the cut of the canal by the phlegm which has come out of it with that which is disrupted from it and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore when the time has passed in which perforation is feared, bring together the two lips of the skin of the wound, and sew it alone without the cartilage.
And afterwards administer medicines that make flesh grow until it is healed.
And Albucasis said that the summary of the discourse which we have recounted, the explanation is nothing but that you see that some of these abscesses have already blocked the throat of the patient, and the patient has come to the point of death, and his breath is cut off, and some go to cut the epiglottis so that the patient may breathe over the place of the wound by some respiration, and be saved from death.
And for this they commanded to leave the wound open until the malignancy of the disease is consumed; and its malignancy is for three days; and then they commanded to sew the wound, and cure it until it is healed.
And what I have seen for myself, is that a servant took a knife and put it in her throat and cut with it a part of the windpipe, and I was called to the cure of her, and I found the moaning as is the moaning of the dying, and I uncovered the wound and found the blood which had come out of the wound little.
Therefore I confessed that she had not cut a vein or windpipe, and the air was coming out of the wound, and I cured it until it was healed.
And nothing happened to the servant except hoarseness in the voice, and after some days she returned to improvement of her conditions.
And now I say that in the cutting of the epiglottis there is no fear.
Chapter 44.
On cutting above an abscess which occurs in the throat outside, and is called hernia of the throat.
This abscess named hernia of the throat is a large abscess according to the color of the body, and is common in women.
And it is according to two manners, for it is either natural or accidental.
And in the natural there is no means of curing.
And the accidental is according to two manners of which one is similar to fatty nodes, and the other manner is similar to an abscess which is made by knotting of an artery, and in that there is fear. And it is not fitting that presumption be made to it with iron except in that which is small. And you test it and investigate it with the finger, and if you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not suspended with any of the veins, then you cut it just like the nodes, and extract it with that which contains it of the skin and sac; and if not, then all its being is examined, and afterwards cure the place with that which is fitting for curing until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
On the incision of the types of nodes.
There are many types of nodes and I have already mentioned all their types in the division.
And it is appropriate that I recount here the difference between node and exitura as it causes doubt.
So I say that with exitura there is heat and fever and vehement pains until the ebullition of the superfluity is calmed; and putrefaction is complete when the fever, pain and heat cease.
But with a node there is no heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains that ciphac leon which is in its own sac.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a chickpea and it is made thus as it grows, be it major or minor, and they are of two types, for they are either fatty and contain humidity, and the colors of the humidity are many, as I said in the division.
So it is appropriate, when you come to the cure of a node, that you examine it and investigate it at the beginning with an instrument which is called intromes, as its form will come in the chapter which is after this one.
And it is a manner of investigation of apostemas and of all nodes, and it is that you take this instrument and introduce it in the most humid place which you find in the apostema, and you will revolve your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
And after, move your hand according to the measure of the size of the apostema, and then extract the intromes and consider what has come out in its trace.
And if the running humidity is expelled, of whatever color it may be, then you incise it with a superficial incision as I have said in the other apostemas.
And if no humidity comes out of the trace of the intromes, then know that it is fatty.
And dry over it with an incision having the form of a cross according to this form: as I have taught you, and suspend it with hooks, and skin the hide from all parts with ease, and keep the skin or sac, if you can, over it and extract that sanies with the node.
But if it is broken in the operation, it is not possible to extract it healthy, and this happens many times, and then you extract it in pieces until nothing remains of it.
For if any of it remains, little or much, the node returns according to the greater part.
And if you see that some small part of it remains, then complete the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and tighten the wound, and place on it what calms a hot apostema, and cure it with the other cure until it is healed.
And if it is a large node, then you sew its two lips and cure it with what incarnates.
But if a pulsating vein is contrary to it, or non-pulsating, then you hasten and fill the place with ground vitriol and leave it tight for two days or for three until the wound rots and the ebullition of the blood rests; and after return to incise what remains of the node.
Chapter 46.
On the forms of instruments necessary for cutting and perforating.
Of these are the forms of instruments, and they are of three types, for some of them are large, some are medium, and some are small.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
Let them be made of iron, of steel, with properly squared ends, so that they may quickly enter the abscesses.
And these are the forms of probes, and they are called albered, and one of them is called berid.
And they are of three types, for some are large, medium and small.
The form of the large probe, its shape:
The form of the medium probe, its shape:
The form of the small probe, its shape:
They are suitable for those abscesses and sores and fistulas and buboes because among them are those of bones and other things.
And they are made round, thick, smooth, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, and they are made of citron brass, or brass or iron, or silver. And the best are when they are made of citron brass.
And the probes are made of black lead, which are agreed to be used to open fistulas in the concavity of which there are reflections, that they may be reflected with their lightness with those reflections.
And they are of three types, for some of them are long, and others medium, and others short, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and its narrowness.
Form of the large lead probe:
Form of the medium lead probe:
Form of the small lead probe:
The forms of hooks are of many types, for some of them are simple, which have only one curve, and they are of three types: large, small and medium.
And some of them are blind hooks, and they are of three types.
And some of them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three types.
And some of them have three curves, and they are of three types.
And all of these are necessary in their place.
Form of small simple hook, its shape:
Form of large hook having two curves: Form of medium hook having two curves: Form of small hook having two curves:
Form of large hook having three curves:
Form of medium hook having three curves:
And these are the forms of scalpels with which nodes and abscesses are cut and skinned, and they are of three types, because of these there is large, medium, and small.
Form of large scalpel:
Form of medium scalpel:
Form of small scalpel:
The extremities of these with which incision is made are sharp and the other extremities are not sharp, and they are not placed in such a manner, except to provide assistance in the excoriation of nodes, the fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and by these the patient is healed and finds tranquility a little by the cauterization which he finds towards the excoriation of the abscess.
And these are the forms of probes, and they are of three types: large, medium and small, as you will see.
They are made of copper and are similar to the ray with which kohl is applied.
And at the wide extremity it is punctured with a hidden spatula and in that it runs to the parts inside and outside, when you want, as you see.
The forms of spatulas, which are hidden between the fingers towards the perforation of abscesses and the patients do not perceive them, and they are of three types: large, medium and small. And these are their forms:
The forms of cupping glasses with which blood flow is stopped, and they are of three types; large, medium and small; their forms:
They are made of citrus-colored copper, round with some length, and they are thin.
And it is appropriate that these types of cupping glasses be large, medium and small for you, so that with them you can stop blood flow quickly in case of necessity, and when you first have no medicine.
However, do not use them to stop blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places, such as in the muscles of the legs and thighs, and in the muscles of the arms, and of the breasts and of the belly and of the groins, and similar to them of the moist fleshy muscles.
And sometimes other small instruments are made from these resembling fig peels according to this form; by which blood is stopped when it is done by phlebotomy, or towards incision of vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round according to this form:
Chapter 47.
On the treatment of men's breasts which resemble those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men are swollen towards the completion of sleep when they begin to be hairy, and afterwards the breasts are swollen, and the breasts resemble those of women, and remain swollen, ugly.
And for one who dislikes this, it is appropriate to cut them with a lunar incision according to this form, from the line of B to the line of G, and afterwards skin all the thickness, and afterwards fill the wound with incarnative medicine, and afterwards join the two lips of the wound with suture, and treat that until it is healed.
But if the breast declines to the lower parts and is softened by its magnitude as happens to women, then it should be split in its two upper sides, with two incisions resembling a lunar figure, of which each is contained in the other towards the end of each, until the major line contains the minor according to this form from the line of B and the line of G. And afterwards skin the hide which is between two lips of the wound, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about the suture and the powders that which is necessary in the treatment until it is healed.
And if you do not complete the incision of what should be cut due to the restlessness of the patient, and due to blood flow, then it is appropriate that you fill the wound with cotton submerged in corrosive ointment and leave that until it corrodes what remains of the fat, and afterwards treat that until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
On the perforation of abscesses that come under the armpit.
These abscesses that come under the armpit are of the species of scrofula, hard, which contain a skin that is like a sac.
And of these, some contain fluids; and those that contain fluids should be incised with a lunar section according to this figure: from line G to line B. And when all that is in the abscess of pus is evacuated, then you fill it with old cotton and leave it until the next day.
And after the cotton is removed, it should be treated with a suitable ointment for this, until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the species of nodes, and of scrofula, then you cut over it as we have said in the section on scrofula equally.
But if the wound is extended so that pus comes out, then administer cautery to it as we have said before.
Chapter 49.
On the incision of abscesses that occur by artery or by vein.
When an artery is ruptured, and the skin is consolidated which is over it, then many times an abscess occurs. And the signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are by the artery or by vein: for when the abscess is by artery it is long gathered in the depth of the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel in it as if there is a whistle.
And that which is by vein is round to the manifest of the body.
And incision on this abscess is an error, and especially in that which is under the armpits, and in the groins, and in the neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very large, so it is appropriate that its cure with iron be avoided, and that which is in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
But on that which is of them by inflammation of the orifice of the artery, cut in the skin a section in the length; and after open the section with hooks and after the artery, and deliver from the tunics until it is uncovered.
And after put a needle on it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tighten the artery with double thread in two places, — which thing I taught you in extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
And after puncture the place which is between two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood that is in it comes out, and the abscess is dissolved.
And after administer treatment in which pus is generated until the ligaments fall; and after cure it with ointments suitable for this until it is healed.
And if it is an abscess by section of vein, then it is appropriate that you hold with your hand what is possible for you of the abscess with the skin, and after introduce the needle under the place which you have held under your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be in it double thread until you extract it from the other side, and after tie the abscess with good binding as I have told you in the binding of grape of two parts with two extremities of the thread.
But if you fear that we extract the thread, then introduce the thread with that needle under all the abscess towards the incision of the first needle, and tighten your threads in four places.
After dry the abscess in the middle place of it until when what is in it has come out, then you cut the superfluity of the skin, and leave that which of it is bound.
And after place on it a compress which you have submerged in wine and oil, and after administer the treatment which is made with poultices and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 50 on the aposteme which occurs due to twisting of nerves.
Just as aposteme occurs in arteries and veins, similarly aposteme occurs in the nerves when there is percussion or excessive work, and similar causes.
And it is mostly made in the places of the arms or the heel, or in any place where the joints are moved.
And it is a serious aposteme, and it resembles the color of the rest of the body, and in most cases it is without pain and when it is tightly pressed, the patient feels a numbness-like sensation.
And the aposteme is not gathered in the depths of the body, so it is under the skin, and it moves to all parts and does not go to the front or back parts.
Therefore, those that are in the joints should not be invaded with iron, because contraction would easily occur.
But that which is on the head or on the forehead, cut the skin with a spatula. But if the aposteme is small, then hold it with forceps and cut it out from the root.
And if it is large, then you suspend it with a hook, and flay it, and then remove it; and close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 51.
On cutting the aposteme which occurs from growths that occur on the belly.
It happens to some men many times in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies growths which are called fungal because of their similarity to mushrooms, of which the root is thin and the head is large; and their edges are turned, and some are small, and some are very enlarged.
And I have seen one, and in its belly were two growths which were more like mushrooms, and there was no difference between those white ones, with a small root.
And their edges were inverted and split, and moisture ran from it all the time.
So I cut them and found in one a weight of about 18 ounces and the other about 6 ounces.
And the operation in cutting them is that you consider then if the patient is moist, and the color of the growth is white, moist, with a thin root; then you cut it with a broad spatula, and have cauteries in the fire in your presence, because often after cutting it much blood is expelled; and if the blood overcomes you, cauterize it.
And if you see the patient fearful and timid, beware of cutting with iron; but then take newly made lead wire, and tighten the growth with it, the manner of which is that which we have said; and leave it for two days.
And afterwards add to the tightening of the lead wire; so, do not cease to tighten the lead many times on the growth, until it is cut off and falls by itself without effort.
But if the growth has a thick root, then in cutting it there is some cause for concern and fear, especially in that which is on the belly.
But it is possible that you cut half of it, and afterwards cauterize it so that it does not return.
And afterwards treat it until the wound is healed.
And beware that you do not presume to cut a growth which is of dark color, of little feeling, of ugly appearance, because that is almost cancerous.
And I will come with a reminder of cancer after this.
Chapter 52
On the treatment of swelling of the navel.
Swelling of the navel is caused by many things: by fissures in the abdominal wall, from which the membrane or intestine protrudes as in other ruptures; by blood flowing from a vein or artery as mentioned before, or by trapped gas.
But if it's due to a fissure in the abdominal wall and protrusion of the membrane, then the color of the swelling is similar to the body's color; it's soft without pain, and appears in different positions. And if it's due to intestinal protrusion, then its position varies more than what we've described, and when you press it with your fingers it disappears, then returns; it's often accompanied by sound, and is greatly enlarged by bathing and strenuous work.
But if it's due to fluid, then it's soft and doesn't disappear when you press with your hand, nor is it constrained or enlarged.
And if it's due to blood, then with these signs the swelling appears to be darkening.
But if it's due to flesh growth, then the swelling is serious, large and hard, and is fixed in one place.
But if it's due to gas, then touching it feels soft.
The procedure is to consider whether the navel swelling is due to arterial or venous blood, or gas; then it's advisable to avoid treating it, because it's dangerous as I've taught you in the chapter about swellings caused by arteries and veins.
If the navel swelling is due to intestine or membrane, then you should instruct the patient to hold their breath and lie stretched out; then mark around the entire navel with a probe, and then tell them to lie face up between your hands on their back, and then encircle the navel area you marked with a broad spatula; then extend half of the swelling to the upper parts with a large hook; and then tie around it with strong thread or silk in a proper tying manner.
Then open the middle of the swelling extended over the tie and insert your finger into that opening and search for the intestine; if you've found it and secured it with the tie, then you extract it carefully and push the intestine into the inner parts of the belly.
And if you've found the membrane, then take it with a hook; and cut away the excess parts of it.
But if you encounter an artery or vein, then carefully go around it, and then return to your operation; and take two needles and put two strong threads in them and insert the two needles into the circle you've made around the swelling in the shape of a cross, which you should make penetrate; and then tighten the swelling in four parts over the needles.
And if you want, remove the needles and leave the place until the extended flesh rots and falls off by itself; or cut it when it's thinned and rotting, and then treat it with appropriate ointments until it's healed.
And if the navel swelling is from flesh grown there or from fluid, then you should hollow out the swelling as we've said and remove the blood or fluid which you find in it, and then treat it with what's appropriate and consolidate the area.
Chapter 53
On the treatment of cancer.
We have already spoken, in the division, of the type of cancer and in what manner it is treated with medicines, and that treatment with iron should be avoided so that it does not become ulcerated; and we have spoken of cancer generated in the womb and caution in treating it.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it, such as cancer which is in the breasts or in the thigh and similar parts of the body allocated to extract all of it, and especially when it is beginning small.
But when it is old and large, it is not advisable that you attempt it, for I have not been able to cure anyone of it nor have I seen another do so, nor that it has come to that.
And the operation on it when it is located as we have said, is that you proceed and leave the patient and purge the black bile sometimes, and afterwards bleed them, if manifest repletion is found.
And afterwards prepare the patient with preparation in which it is placed with operation, and afterwards throw into the hole hooks which are suitable for that; and afterwards hollow out from all sides with the skin according to good examination until no part of its roots remains. And let the blood run, and do not cut it lightly, and press the places, and wipe away the thick blood all with your hand or with an instrument with which it is possible for you from the instruments.
But if cutting a vein or artery causes you difficulty with thick blood, then cauterize it until the blood flow has ceased, and afterwards treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 54
On the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, the types of water dropsy, and the signs of each type, of treating it with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is only the species of ascites alone, and the species of tympanites nor the species of anasarca should not be approached with iron, for that is fatal.
And when you have already treated this species of tympanitic dropsy with medicines and your medication does not work, then consider, for if weakness has already come to the patient, or they have another illness besides dropsy, such as if they have a cough or stomach ache and similar to those, then be careful not to treat them with iron, for there is fear about that.
But if you see the patient with abundant strength, and they have no other illness but dropsy only, and neither a child nor old, then the manner of operating on them is that you raise the patient between your hands, and the minister afterwards presses their belly with his hand, pushing the water to the lower part of the pubic area, and afterwards take a spiny spatula according to this form:
Let it be long with two sharp parts, with a sharp end like a spatula; but let there be in it some shortness little by little, so that in operating with it you do not pass through to the intestine, and injure it.
And afterwards consider if the generation of dropsy is from the part of the intestines, for then it is advisable that you with the incision move away from the navel by the quantity of three fingers to the lower parts, in the right of it above the pubic area.
But if the generation of dropsy is by illness of the liver, then let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is by the spleen, then let your incision be on the right side.
And it is not advisable that your incision be on the side on which the patient wants to lie so that the superfluities do not run to that weak place.
And afterwards perforate with the instrument all the skin, and afterwards introduce into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the skin and the peritoneum, and you flay it; and let the quantity be of a fingernail or thereabouts.
And afterwards pierce the abdomen until you reach the empty space at the location, which is the place of the water. And after extracting that, introduce an instrument of which this is the form: and it is similar to a thin silver tube; it is made of silver or copper or brass, which at its lower part has a small hole, and on its sides are three holes: two on one side and one on the other side; and its extremity is cut in the manner of a pen, as you see:
And at its upper extremity is a ring, for when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends over the instrument, thus evacuating half the quantity of water in an hour, for if you evacuate more than is suitable in an hour, the patient very easily dies by dissolution of his animal spirit, or syncope occurs which is close to death.
But evacuate it according to the quantity of his strength and according to what the patient's condition indicates to you of the strength of his pulse and his wellbeing.
And after extracting the instrument, the water is retained which is because it is immediately held by the skin which retains the hole that is above the abdomen of which I have told you to pierce in that manner.
And afterwards repeat the instrument the next day if you see the patient tolerating it, and extract a small quantity of water, and do this for some days with caution, and guard yourself from error until only a little water remains.
But if you fear for the patient, and leave a large quantity of water, then treat him with burial in warm sand, and much sweating in a bath, and in the sun waiting for a long time; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed.
And cauterize over the stomach, and the spleen and the liver after the extraction of the water, as I have recounted in what has preceded.
Chapter 55.
On the treatment of infants who are born with the places of urine not perforated.
Sometimes some of the infants come out of their mother's womb and the head of their urethra is not perforated (or the hole is narrow or not in its place).
So it is necessary to hasten with perforation of it as soon as it is born with a very thin blade according to this form:
And afterwards place in the hole a thin lead nail and tie it, and keep it for three days or four.
And when he wants to urinate, let it be removed and let him urinate; and afterwards return it.
And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine which goes over the place, does not allow this to close.
But he whose hole is narrow should be treated with a lead nail, as we have said, for many days until it is widened.
But those in whom the hole is not in its place, are injured, which is because of those, the one who is born and the hole is towards the end of the head of the penis so that he cannot urinate to the inner parts, until he raises the penis with his hand to the upper parts; and there is no generation for him, because the sperm cannot reach the mother in a straight line, and it is a very ugly disease.
And the manner of operation on him is that the patient be laid on his back, and afterwards extend the head of his penis with your left hand with vehement extraction, and cut the head of the penis from the place of the foreskin with a sharp blade, as is the cutting of a pen, or that you shave some part of it, so that its middle comes to resemble the head of the penis and that the hole falls in the middle place as is suitable.
And guard yourself in your operation from blood flow, for many times this happens; and apply to him with that which stops the blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
About a growth which occurs on the foreskin at the head of the penis, and about corruption and blackening and adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis.
Many times this growth occurs on the penis and it is a prominence of ugly flesh.
And of this, one is malignant and another is non-malignant.
For the non-malignant one, it is suitable that you suspend it with a thin hook and cut it off until you clean it all; and afterwards place cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment on it; and after that, treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the growth is malignant, of ugly color, then it is suitable that you administer cautery after the incision and removal of it.
But if the growth is on the foreskin of the head of the uncircumcised penis, and one part of the growth is inside the foreskin and the other part is outside, then it is suitable that you remove the growth which is inside at the beginning until it is consolidated; and then you treat that outside, because when you treat that together with the foreskin, it is not assured that it will not be cut.
And likewise it happens in the genitals and in the foreskin blackening and corruption, then it is suitable that you remove all that which is already blackened and which is about to corrupt or which is already corrupted; and afterwards apply to that after this with honey, which is mixed with flour of pomegranate bark and ground and sifted vetch.
And afterwards treat that with the other treatment until it is healed.
But if blood flow occurs, then administer lunar cautery according to this form:
for beneficial cautery is for two conditions together, that is for blood flow and for the wound when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and is completely destroyed at the time, then it is suitable that you insert a lead tube into the opening of the foreskin so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis (and this adhesion only happens in one whose foreskin is healthy, and on which circumcision is not required; and when adhesion happens due to a wound or abscess) it is suitable that you separate with a blunt spatula until the bond is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
And if it is difficult to separate these precisely, then it is suitable that you scrape with a spatula something from the head of the penis and from the foreskin, and this is because the foreskin, when it is thin, is very easily perforated due to its thinness.
And afterwards separate between the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has been moistened in cold water so that they do not adhere again.
And afterwards let it be treated with astringent wine until it is healed.
Chapter 57.
About the cleansing of children and the treatment of what happens to them from circumcision.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity like other wounds: but however as it is of our operation and of our will, and its use is primarily in children, it is necessary that we assign in it the best operation and easiest way leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not describe circumcision in any of their books, because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired it through experiment, which is that I have found the majority of craftsmen and barbers using circumcision and cleansing with a razor and with forceps; and they use tying with thread and cutting with the fingernail.
And I have already tried all these methods and did not find better cleansing with scissors, with tying with thread than in cleansing with the fingernail, because many times the upper skin escapes, because the skin of the foreskin has two layers, and the lower layer remains, and very easily it is forced to another incision and secure pain. And with cleansing which is done by alphecati, and is digital, which cobblers use, the incision of the extremity of the male member is not secured, for it easily enters into its hole.
But in the operation with a nail, iron easily obeys and corrupts your operation. And the foreskin of the child is naturally short, and often born in such a way that it has no need of cleansing, and I have seen this.
But of the cleansing that is done with scissors and bindings with thread, the goodness, experiment revealed to me, for the scissors are of proportional incision, because the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below; and thus when you press your hand they are proportioned two sharpnesses, and they cut according to a comparison at one time; and compression of the thread is made with a figure containing the foreskin of the penis from all parts, with which no error falls at all.
And the manner of the first operation is that you make the child stay, especially if he is one of those who understand a little, that you do nothing but tie the thread on his penis only, and leave it until the next day.
And afterward make him rejoice in every way that is possible to you from what his intelligence receives. And afterward make him stay between your hands standing prepared, and not sitting; and hide the scissors in your hand or under your foot, so that the child does not see them nor any other of the instruments.
And afterward introduce your hand to his penis and blow on the foreskin, and pull it until the head of the penis has come out, and afterward clean it of what is gathered on it of dirt.
The form of the scissors for cleansing, this is the form:
Let one extremity be non-cutting and the other be cutting, that the branch of the nail not be out, and let the length of the two sharpnesses be like the length of two handles equally.
But the error in cleansing is that the inner foreskin very easily escapes whole, or part of it towards the incision.
Therefore it is necessary that you extend it from your time with your nail before the swelling of the place and that you cut it according to equality.
And if you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a hook and cut it.
But if three days have passed, and what is swollen remains under the penis swollen, then you leave that until the hot swelling has subsided, and skin it with ease, and cut it according to what is prepared for you.
And guard yourself from the head of the penis, for that will not harm it.
And then cure it with that which consolidates the wound of the powders which we have recounted in the treatise on powders.
And if it is cut of the foreskin over measure, and obeys the upper parts, that does not harm it.
And moreover cure it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
On the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by blockage due to stone, congealed blood, pus, or flesh growth, and similar to those we have mentioned in the types of treatments in the division.
And if it is not dissolved with what we have said and the condition becomes severe for the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, of which this is the form: Let it be of silver and be a subtle hollow tube, like the quill of a bird’s feather with the subtlety of a long ray in the likeness of a palm and a half, to which is a thin tube at its head.
And the manner of the urine's exit through it is that you take the doubled thread and tie wool or cotton at its extremity with a good binding; and insert the ends of the thread in the lower part of the syringe, and cut with scissors if any part of the wool is superfluous, but insert it into the tube with force. And then anoint the syringe with butter and egg white.
And make the patient sit on the chair, and bathe his bladder and penis with moist oils, olive oil and rose water.
And then insert the syringe gently until it reaches the root of the penis; and then bend the penis upwards towards the navel; and then push the syringe inside it; and then push it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it has reached the empty space, and this is not done according to this order, except for the passage which goes in a tortuous way.
And then extend the thread with the wool little by little, for the urine follows the wool.
Then extract it and make urine for treatment, and use the syringe, do not cease to do this and use the syringe until the bladder is evacuated and the patient finds relief.
Chapter 59.
On the quality of clysterization of the bladder with clampcedra and similar instruments which are suitable for this.
When ulceration or abscess occurs in the bladder, or congealed blood in it, or pus is confined, and you want to distill waters and medicines in it, then let it be done with an instrument which is called clampcedra, and this is its form:
except that at its extremity it is deaf, that is, closed. And in it are three holes: two on one side, as you see.
At the beginning is a hollow place, in which is that which is pushed, and let it be according to the quantity that blocks it, without addition, until when something is drawn from the humors with it, let it be drawn, and when it is expelled, with this let it be drawn, and when it is expelled long, according to what the clampcedra does with which naphtha is fixed in sea battles.
So when you want to project humors into the bladder, insert the extremity of the clampcedra into the humidity, and draw with it that which is pushed to the upper parts, for the humidity is drawn into the concavity of the clampcedra.
And then insert the extremity of the clampcedra into the penis as we have recounted for the syringe; and then push the humidity with that which you push, for that humidity reaches the bladder immediately, and the patient feels it.
Form of the subtle enema with which the bladder is given an enema, and this is its form:
And let it be made of silver or brass, of which the highest part resembles a small feather, and below the hollow inside smoothly.
And then take a sheep's bladder, and put in it the liquid that you want to administer as an enema in the bladder, and then tie it between two with a strong double thread, and heat that liquid over the fire.
And then insert the end of the enema into the penis.
And then press your hand on the bladder with the liquid with descending pressure until the patient feels that the liquid has already reached the bladder.
But if you don't have a bladder available, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it; and perforate it all around its circumference; and then insert strong thread in those holes, as if they were rolled up; and then fold the circle as a sulfur match is folded, after you put in it what you want of the liquids, and oils and waters.
And then you tie that to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, and press with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
On the extraction of stone.
We have already spoken about the division of types of stone and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between stone formed in the kidneys and stone formed in the bladder, and their signs.
And we have spoken about the stone in which operation by hand and cutting is necessary.
And the stone formed in the bladder is properly that which is fixed in the bladder.
And I am narrating that with clear explanation and brevity.
So I say that stone formed in the bladder mostly comes to children; and among its signs is that the urine that comes out of the bladder is similar to water in its thinness, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs his penis, and often hangs, and then is erected; and with that the anus comes out in many of them.
And the healing of children from that is easy until they have reached 14 years; and treatment is difficult in old men. But in young men it is intermediate because it is between those.
And for one whose stone is larger the treatment is easier; And if it is small, it is the opposite to that.
So when we come to the treatment of that, it is appropriate at the beginning of it that we cleanse the patient with an enema which extracts all the excrement which is in his intestines; because that excrement sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone during the examination of it.
And then let the patient be taken by his feet and shaken and moved downwards so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or that it jumps from a high place sometimes.
And then make him sit prepared between your hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the whole bladder is made to incline to the lower parts.
And then examine it and all of it from outside.
So if you feel the stone in the space, then you hurry at once with cutting over it.
And if it doesn't fall completely under your touch, then it is appropriate that you anoint with oil your index finger of the left hand, if the patient is a child, or the middle finger if he is a grown young man, and insert that in his anus. And search for the stone until it is under your finger. And turn it little by little until the neck of the bladder.
And then press on it with your finger, and expel it to the outer parts towards the place from which you make the cut.
And command the minister to press the bladder with his hand; and command another minister to extend the genitals to the upper parts with his right hand, and with his other hand to move the skin which is below the genitals, in part of the place where the incision is made.
And after that, introduce a well-cutting spatula of which this is its form: and cut with it that which is between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle place, but to the side of the left thigh; and let the incision be over that stone and your finger be in the anus, and let a transverse incision be made, so that the outer incision is wide and the inner narrow according to the quantity that the removal of the stone is possible to it, and no greater, for your finger which is in the anus very easily compresses the stone towards the incision, and it is expelled without difficulty.
And know that of the stone there is some which have angles and edges, because of which its exit is made difficult.
And of that, it is like a lion similar to an acorn, and it is round, and its exit is made easily.
Therefore if it is one which has angles and edges, add to the fissure.
And if it is not expelled thus, then it is necessary that you contrive upon it, or that you press upon it with a decent gesture, the extremity of which should be like a file with which you press upon the stone, and it does not escape from it; or that you introduce below it a subtle instrument with a curved extremity.
But if you cannot do this, then you enlarge the hole a little, and if you see a flow of blood, cut it off by pressing it with ground vitriol.
But if there is more than one stone, then at the beginning you push the hand to the mouth of the bladder, and after cut over it; and after push a little after that; and do similarly if there are many more than two.
And if it is a very large stone, then it is ignorance that you cut it with a large incision, for one of two things happens to the patient: either he dies or continuous urine leakage befalls him, because the place is not completely consolidated.
But administer its expulsion until it is expelled, or contrive in breaking it with forceps until you extract it in pieces.
Therefore when you will have completed your operation, then fill the wound with incense of aloe and dragon's blood, and tighten it. And place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and cold water, so that hot swelling may be reduced.
And after lay the patient on his back, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you have untied it, bathe the place with water and much oil, and after treat it with diafinicon ointment and diabazilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound there occurs hot swelling, burning and corrosive, and similar to that as if the blood is congealed in the bladder, and because of it the urine is prohibited (and this is known by the exit of blood with urine), then introduce your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains it provokes the bladder to corruption of the bladder and putrefaction of it.
And after wash the wound with vinegar, water and salt, and with opposition to every kind, with that which is suitable to it of the treatment until it is healed.
It is necessary during the hours of all the treatment that you bind both thighs and apply the medicines which are placed on the location.
And if the stone is small and is in the passage of the penis, and is stuck in it, and likewise urine is prohibited, then cure that with what I recount before you proceed to cutting, because too often for this cure you are accused of cutting; and I have already tested this, and it is that you take an iron perforator alfelt, of which this is the form of it:
of triangular extremity, sharp, fixed in wood.
And after take thread, and tie with that the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
And after introduce the iron in the penis, perforating with ease until the perforator comes to that stone. And turn the perforator with your hand on that stone little by little, and you force the perforation of it until you make it penetrate from the other side; because the urine is immediately released.
And after press your hand over what remains of the stone from the outside part of the penis, because that is broken, and is thrown out with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this cure is not prepared for you for any cause which prohibits it, then tie a thread below the stone, and another thread above the stone. And after cut over the stone in that penis between two bindings. And after extract it. And after untie the binding and clean the congealed blood, which is made in the wound.
And it is not necessary to bind thread below the stone, except so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other binding above except, because when the thread is untied after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.
And for this it is necessary for you when you tie the thread above, that you raise the skin to the parts above, or that it returns towards your completion, and covers the wound as we have said.
Chapter 61.
Of extraction of stone from women.
Stone in women is little engendered.
But if stone comes to any of those, then difficult is the cure of it, and it is prohibited in many ways.
One of them is because the woman is very easily a virgin.
And the second is because you do not find a woman well-knowing who uncovers herself to the doctor when she is chaste, or is of the women having husbands.
The third is because you do not find a woman well-knowing this art, especially the operation by hand.
And the fourth is that the place of the section over stone in women is far from the place of the stone, for which you need a deep section, and in that there is fear.
But if necessity provokes you to this, then it is fitting that you take a well-knowing female doctor, and little is found.
But if you are deprived of that, then seek a chaste and subtle doctor, or present a matron woman well-taught in the deed of women, or woman who in this art now part of the art.
So make that present, and command to her that she do all that you will command her, of the inquisition over the stone at the beginning; which thing is that she look if the woman is a virgin, then it is fitting that she put her finger in the bottom of her and seek the stone.
So if she finds that, constrain that under her finger, and then command her that she cut over that.
But if she is not a virgin, then command the matron that she introduce her finger in the vagina of the patient and inquire about the stone, since she places her left hand over the bladder, and compress that with good compression.
So if she finds that, then it is fitting that she gradually move that from the orifice of the bladder to the parts below with the sum of her virtue until she comes with that to the root of the thigh.
And after cut over that apposition of the half of the vagina towards the root of the thigh of whichever part is prepared to her and feels the stone in that part, and her finger not be removed from the stone constraining under it.
And the incision should be small at the beginning; and then insert the instrument into that incision, and if it feels the stone, then adjust the incision according to the size which you know the stone will be removed from it.
And know that there are many types of stones: for of these there are small and large, and smooth and rough, and long and round, and having branches.
Therefore you should know how many types there are of it so that you can indicate which one you want.
And if you see a flow of blood, add ground vitriol to the place and hold it for an hour until the blood is stopped, and then return to your operation until the stone is removed.
And make sure you prepare with you the instruments which are mentioned for the extraction of stones in men, so that you may be aided by them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of blood, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that is cut, then you put powder on the place and tighten it with compresses and descending pressure, and do not repeat this; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for the patient will likely die soon. And afterwards treat the wound.
Therefore when the acuteness of the blood has ceased after some days, and the place has healed, then you return to your operation until the stone is removed.
Chapter 62.
On the incision for watery hernia.
Watery hernia is nothing but an aggregation of moisture in the white membrane which is under the skin of the genitals containing the egg, and is called ciphac.
And sometimes it is in the proper membrane which nature prepared for it in the part of the egg, until it is thought that it is already another egg; and it is the skin of the genitals between the white membrane which we have mentioned, and this is not except rarely.
And the generation of this hernia is by weakness which happens to the genitals, for which this matter is poured into them, and sometimes it happens by percussion made on the genitals.
And this moisture has many colors, for its color is either inclining to citrine or to blood-like, or red, or it is black and feculent, or it is watery white, and this is what is most common.
And the signs by which it is known where this aggregation of water is are these: for if it is in the white membrane which we have mentioned, then the swelling is round inclining a little to length like the shape of an egg, and the genital appears, for the moisture contains it on all sides.
And if the moisture is in the proper membrane, then the swelling is round with part of the egg and for this reason one estimates that it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the genitals and the white membrane, then it falls below the feeling.
And when you want knowledge of the color of the moisture, then you test the color of the moisture in the swelling with a square probe of which the form is preceded; and according to what has come out in the trace of the probe, judge what is inside it.
Therefore when we come to the cure of it with iron, then it is proper that we command the patient to be bled if this is possible for you, and you see his body full.
And afterwards let him be laid on his back on something a little high, and place many cloths under him.
And afterwards sit you on his left side, and command the assistant to sit on his right side, who extends his rod to one of two sides to the skin of the genitals and to the part of the mirac of the belly.
And afterwards take a broad spatula and cut the skin of the genitals from the middle place along the length until near the pubis.
And let the incision be made according to straightness equally distant from the line that divides the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the white containing membrane.
And flay it, and observe, and be careful not to cut it; and your flaying with which you flay it partially, even if it is suspended with the egg, but carefully examine with the flaying according to the quantity possible for you.
And then perforate the ciphac full of water with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
And then separate between the two lips of the section with hooks, and extend the ciphac to the upper parts; and do not touch the skin comprising the genitals, and cut the ciphac in that manner which is possible for you. And cut it in its entirety or in pieces, and mainly its thin side, because if you do not examine carefully its incision, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.
But if the egg proceeds from that outside of its skin at the time of your operation, then when you have completed the section of the ciphac, return it inside, and then adjust the two lips of the skin of the genitals with suture, and then cure it as with other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the egg corrupted by another illness, then it is appropriate that you tie the vessels which are above the suspensory, and extract the egg, and then cure it with what we have said.
But if the water is gathered in two parts together, then know that there are two hernias; so cut that part as you have done in the other equally; and if it seems to you that it is one operation, then do it.
And then you clean the blood, and insert into the sections wool soaked in oil or rose oil; and place outside other wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two genitals and the midriff of the belly; and place above doubled cloths and compresses, and tie those above with a bandage which is according to this form:
and then let two cloths be taken and filled with carded wool according to this likeness; and let the extremities be made with which it is pressed with cotton or wet wool, and let them be gathered with tightness in the fly of the trousers, and let one of the extremities take from the buttocks to the back, and the second take to the part of the groin, and two extremities over the two thighs below and two other extremities over the two groins, and let all tightness be adjusted in the fly of the trousers.
And sometimes this hernia is medicated artificially with cautery instead of section with iron; and it is that you take a subtle knife cautery and that you cut with it the skin of the genitals, and it is heated as we have recounted until the white ciphac containing the water is uncovered, and then you take a cautery according to this form: and it is resembling a Greek letter.
And then perforate with that ciphac, and it is heated until all the humidity is expelled.
And then extend the ciphac with hooks, and flay with hooks, and flay with subtle heated cautery; and cut it as is possible for you until you eradicate all of it; and be careful of the egg that the fire does not touch it.
And know that this operation is safer and further from blood flow, and better than operation with section.
But if it causes you difficulty, a hot abscess at the time of section or at the time of cautery, or blood flow, then it is appropriate that you cure whatever difficulty it causes you for this, with a cure which is suitable for it according to what is said.
But if the patient is fearful, and does not await the second operation due to its horribleness, then administer perforation according to what I recount here; and it is when it is certified by you, by what we have said of the signs, that this hernia is watery.
Then it is appropriate that you make the patient sit on some elevated seat, then pierce the abscess in the lowest part of it with a broad spatula, and make the perforation according to the length of the body.
And let the opening be wide until all the water flows out.
And then place cotton on the spot and bind it and leave it, so that the remaining water flows out. And then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the discharge of the water at that time when you pierce it: and this is done only because the white membrane at the orifice of the wound causes resistance and prevents the exit of the water, then it is appropriate that you put in the wound a feather or instrument with which water is extracted from dropsy patients, the form of which precedes; or increase the pressure on the wound a little.
And know that the water returns, and is accumulated after six months or thereabouts; and when it is accumulated, then let it be pierced in that same manner, for the patient will thus pass his days.
Chapter 63.
On incision for fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Know that in the incision for this hernia there is fear leading to danger in most cases; therefore to me the dismissal of it and being saved by that seems better.
And I am recalling the operation on it and the types of abscesses.
So, I say that abscesses born in the bodies of which the genitals are composed and this is done for many reasons: either by sharp acrid superfluity, which is poured into the genitals, or by percussion.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and pain is not found in it, and it is a severe abscess.
And very easily it is a petrified abscess, of which the color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it is made by knotting of the arteries, and by inflation of those as has already been perceived the mention of it, or by inflation of veins.
But that which is by inflation of arteries is known by the dispersion of the abscess when you compress it with your fingers; and it is not appropriate that you touch that.
But that which is made by inflation of vein is not dispersed from it anything towards the compression with the fingers.
And it is already possible that on this type incision be made and on the other flesh; and it is that you cut the skin of the genitals, and then extend the egg to the upper parts, and extract it from the white membrane, and free the suspensory of the vessels, and tie them, and cut the suspensory after you free it from every part of the parts of the egg.
So if the egg is already consolidated with those fleshy parts, then it is appropriate that you extract the egg and cut it.
And if there is adherence to some part of the membrane, or between that which is between the vessels, then it is appropriate that you free all that adherence and cut it by round incision.
But if there is growth of flesh in the place of the adherence which is behind, then it is appropriate that you cut all that which is of it, and extract the egg as we have said.
So when your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
On the treatment of hernia that is of the scrotum.
Scrotal hernia is a swelling wrapped by some covering similar to a bud with softening of the testicles, and it makes difficult exercise movement and walking for the patient.
And in the treatment of this disease there is fear because of which remembrance precedes.
However, it is appropriate that we speak of the operation on it according to what the ancients did.
And I say that it is appropriate that you make the patient sit on a raised chair; and then push the suspension of the testicles to the lower parts; and then hold the skin of the genitals with your fingers with the vessels that are close to the penis; and let another minister hold those than you, and extend them with vigorous extension.
And then incise with a wide sharp spatula by transverse section in the right of the vessels until the vessels are uncovered.
And then flay from every part as we have told you in the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
And then stick in those a needle in which there is a double thread, and tie that in the first of the places in which the scrotum is affected, and tie that again in the last of them. And then incise those in the middle place by straight section according to the length of the body, and extract that which is gathered of foul and corrupt humors.
And then cure the wound with treatment of other wounds in which you want healing to be generated so that the vessels which nourish one of the two genitals fall, for it is not bad for that.
But if the scrotum affects all the vessels, then it is appropriate that the testicles be extracted or that the testicles for that dry up with the vessels, so that it is deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels, and that they be destroyed, or that they dry up so that there is no benefit with them.
Chapter 65.
On the cure of intestinal hernia.
The advent of this hernia is by a cut that happens in the peritoneum extended over the belly from the part of the groins of the abdominal wall, through which the intestines descend from that rupture to some of the intestines.
And this rupture is either of the peritoneum or of extension of it, and these two species happen for many causes: either percussion, or by jumps, or by clamor, or by lifting of some heavy thing, or by similar things.
And the sign of that, when it is by extension of the peritoneum, is that it happens little by little over a long time, and does not happen suddenly, and is an even swelling down to the depth because the peritoneum compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it is when it is by cutting of the peritoneum, for at the beginning it makes violent pain happen suddenly; and it is a diverse swelling appearing under the nearby skin appearing, and that is by exit of the intestine, and the body of it to the outside parts of the peritoneum.
And sometimes the membrane is thrown out with the intestine, and this intestinal hernia is called omental.
And sometimes it is made with windiness, and sometimes a crack runs in the intestine, and there it is retained, and with that there is great danger for the patient, and sometimes it makes evil pain happen and especially when it is pressed.
And in the treatment of the types of this disease with iron there is fear, so it is advisable to avoid falling into it.
And the manner of operation for this is that you order the patient to reduce the intestine with his hand to the inner parts of his cavity if it obeys its return, and afterwards he is laid on his neck between your hands, and you raise his legs.
And then stretch the skin which follows the skin of the testicles to the upper parts, and cut the skin of the testicles all along the length; and then fix in two lips of the section hooks according to what you need to open the section with them.
And let the section be according to the quantity that is possible for you that from it the egg is thrown out.
And then skin that ciphaqueth which is below the skin of the testicles, until the white hard ciphac is uncovered on each side.
Then you insert your finger into what follows the testicle, into what is between white ciphac, which is under the skin of the egg, and between the second ciphac, and loosen with that adherence which is in the back part of the egg.
And then move with the hand the skin of the testicles to the outer parts, and with this extend the white ciphac upwards with the left hand, and raise the egg with the ciphac to the part of the section; and order the minister to extend the egg upwards and you dissolve the adherence that is behind with complete solution.
And search with your fingers that there is no cause of the intestine wrapped in the hard white ciphac. But if you find any cause of it, then you push it to the belly below.
And then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles by a section from which blood and pus run as we have recounted in what we have said.
And then administer wool submerged in oil, and place in the wound; and administer the binding which we have recounted (and sometimes the white ciphac is cauterized, which we have said after the cutting of it fearing blood flow, for many times it happens to them) and leave the binding until it falls by itself.
But if its falling is delayed, then let it be sprinkled with hot water, and place over it until it falls as we have said.
And then treat the wound with the other treatment of wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
On windy hernia.
In this hernia I have not seen anyone who has been brave about treating it with iron.
And the first ones said that it is done as we have recounted in the hernia that is with wine; which is that you tie the vessels after the section over it with its ease; and then dry in the middle place around the abscess with what opens it, until the vessels fall.
And treat the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
About the rupture that occurs in the groin.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the groin as we have said, and the area swells.
And nothing from the intestines descends to the genitals; and if it does descend, it's very little; and it returns at all times.
But if the condition is prolonged, a fissure is added in the peritoneum until the intestine descends into the peritoneum; and this happens due to the extension of the peritoneum which is in the groin as we have said, which is because the peritoneum is stretched, and afterwards it softens and the area becomes swollen and protrudes.
And the cure for it is with cautery as has been previously narrated.
And sometimes it is cured with iron in this manner: the patient lies on his back between your hands, and then dry the area of the rupture of the swollen parts with an incision across the width of about three fingers.
And then tighten the white peritoneum that is under the skin until it is exposed.
And then take the probe and place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum, and press it into the depth of the belly.
And then sew the two protruding places over the end of the probe of the peritoneum, and join them together with sutures.
And then extract the end of the probe, and do not cut the peritoneum completely, nor extend the egg, nor anything else as I have informed you in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then treat it with the treatment for wounds, and when you cut the threads, clean it and restore the wound until it is healed; because the peritoneum is contracted and the protrusion of the rupture is not joined.
And cautery is better in this place, as it is closer to health.
Chapter 68.
About softening of the skin of the testicles.
Many times the skin of the testicles in some men is softened because the flesh between them is softened, and its appearance is ugly.
Then it is necessary for the one who is asked to cure it to make the patient lie on his back, and cut all the skin which is softened above the natural skin; and then join the two lips with sutures.
And if you want, sew at the beginning the excess of the softened skin with three or four stitches and with firm sutures.
And then cut between the sutures; and then treat it with the treatment for other wounds until it is healed and the threads fall out.
Chapter 69.
About castration.
Know that castration in our law is excommunicated, but for a reason it is allowed for me to remember it in this book; and the remembrance of it is only necessary for two reasons, of which one is so that it may be in the knowledge of the doctor when he is asked about it, that he may know the cure for one to whom it happens; and the other reason is that we often have need of castration of other animals for our benefit through them, such as rams, and goats, and pigs, and similar animals.
And so I say that castration is done in two ways: either by crushing, or by fissure or cutting.
But in that which is done by crushing, the way of the operation is that we make the animal sit in hot water until its genitals are softened and are slippery and hang down. And then take them with your hand until they are dissolved and do not appear under the touch.
But in castration done by fissure and cutting, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with the left hand.
And then tie the suspensory, and cut over each egg with one cut until the two eggs come out.
And then cut them after you have skinned each one. And do not leave on them any of the peritoneum, except the thin peritoneum which is over the vessels.
And this manner of castration is better which is done by crushing, because crushing very easily leaves some of the testicles so that the animal desires coitus.
And then treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70
On the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men is of two types: one is when it appears in what follows the space in the skin of the testicles, in that which is between two testicles, resembling a woman's genitals in which there is hair.
And sometimes urine flows from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
But in women there is one type: and it is that the woman's genitals above the pubic area are like two male testicles, a little bit diminished on the outside part, like the foreskin of a man and two testicles.
And the treatment is of three types: two for men and one type for women. And it is that you should cut those joined flesh until the impression of it disappears, and afterwards treat those with the treatment of other wounds.
And in the second type of men from which urine flows, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no treatment or operation for it.
Chapter 71
On lentigo and prominent flesh in women's parts.
Lentigo is easily added to natural parts until it is stretched and the appearance becomes ugly; and sometimes it is enlarged in some women so much that it is spread out as in men and reaches to coitus.
Then you should hold the excess of lentigo with your hand or with a hook and cut it.
And do not go too far in cutting, especially in the depth of the root, so that bleeding does not occur.
And afterwards treat it with the treatment of wounds until it is healed.
But grown flesh is flesh that grows in the orifice of the womb until it fills it, and it easily comes out to the outer parts in the shape of a tail (and for this reason some early [physicians] called this "tail disease"); therefore we should cut it as we cut lentigo, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 72
On the treatment of atresia.
Atresia is when the woman's genitals are not perforated, or the hole is small. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is from a disease which has preceded, and that is made either by grown flesh added or by thin or thick membrane.
And it is made either in the depth of the womb, or in its sides, or in its uppermost part, or in its lowest part, and it prevents coitus and conception and childbirth, and often prevents menstruation.
And the diagnosis of it is made by the midwife's inspection, if the obstruction is apparent, nearby; but if it is not apparent, then you search for it with your fingers or with the probe.
But if the obstruction is by thin membrane, and is close to the two labia, then you hurry and break it.
And it is that you place pledgets on the two labia, and afterwards place your index fingers of both hands together.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs extended, and afterwards extend the two labia forcefully until that thin membrane is broken and the obstruction is opened.
And afterwards take wool and soak it in oil and place it on the spot, and she should lie with a man that day so that the cut place does not heal.
But if the membrane is large and thick, then you should cut it with a broad spatula or with a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is by grown flesh, then suspend it with a hook, and cut it.
And you should have with you medicines that stop bleeding without irritation, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and incense, mixed with egg white.
And afterwards administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal too quickly.
And keep it for some days and administer dry flax tow.
And afterwards it should be treated with the other healing treatment until it is healed.
And sometimes other flesh growths occur in the womb, and then you should cut according to this method. But if this is due to a cancerous abscess, the cancerous abscess which is in the womb should not be opposed with iron in any way.
Chapter 73.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids and cuts and red swellings that occur in women's genitals.
Hemorrhoids are swellings of the orifices of many veins from which much blood flows continuously; and when hemorrhoids are old, they become cuts.
And I have already spoken in the division about their types and signs, and I will say here which ones can be cured and which ones cannot be cured.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and cuts when they are deep in the womb and not visible to the senses, then in those no treatment should be done with iron.
But those which are at the orifice of the womb, on which sensation falls, are those that are cured.
And it is appropriate that you put the woman in a warm house and afterwards extend the skin with scissors, or with rough cloth, and cut those at the roots.
And afterwards sprinkle over those where the blood flows one of the cutting powders without irritation, such as acacia and similar to those.
And afterwards raise her feet for an hour, and afterwards place her in cold water.
And if the blood flow persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate peels and galls and similar things.
And afterwards take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar and make a plaster with this on her back.
And if the blood is stopped, it is good; and if not, apply two cups to the breasts without scarification.
And afterwards take wool and submerge it in coriander juice or in plantain juice or in carob juice with diluted wine and apply to the place; and afterwards treat the place with ointments until it is healed.
And treat that until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
On perforation of an opening occurring in the womb.
Many types of swellings occur in the womb, such as cancer and stone-like swellings and ulcerations and adhesions and herpetic conditions and fistulas hemorrhoids and ragades and cuts and other swellings. And I have already spoken of these illnesses and their types and their signs, and their treatments in the division.
And it is appropriate that I speak in this treatise of hot swelling which comes in the womb when it is of the swellings that collect pus, and if you want to know in what manner the operation on it is done with iron.
Then it is appropriate that you consider if the pain of the swelling in its beginning is acute with percussion and phlegm and fever, and you see it redden and if sensation falls on it, then do not hurry with perforation of it, and treat it with that which helps with maturation until the acuteness of the symptoms ceases.
And then it is appropriate that you make the woman sit on a seat that has two seats; and recline on her back and bring her feet to the lower part of the belly, and her thighs should be spread, and place her arms under her knees, and tie each with a binding appropriate to this.
And afterwards the midwife should follow from the right side and administer the instrument with which the orifice of the womb is opened, the form of which will come in those things that will be done afterwards.
And it is appropriate when you want to administer this instrument that you insert with the probe the depth of the woman's womb, and that which of the instrument has entered the womb should not be more than the depth of the womb and injure the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the depth of the womb, then it is appropriate that you place pads on the texture of the depth of the womb so that the entry of the whole instrument into the depth of the womb is prevented.
It is necessary that you place the instrument on the upper side and that the minister holds the instrument and turns it until the orifice of the womb is opened.
And when the swelling appears, and is touched by hand and is smooth and soft, then it is necessary that you cut it towards the head with a wide spatula.
And when the blood is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a wick soaked in rose oil or green oil in which there is some astringency; and place the compress in the incision in the depth of the womb.
And place outside the womb and over the pubic area clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And afterwards it should be treated after two days with an ointment which is suitable for this until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed so that it is treated with water and honey, and afterwards with water in which lily root or long aristolochia has been boiled, and afterwards return to the ointment.
And if the wound is hidden inside the womb, then it is necessary that you are prohibited from treating it with iron, having care for it with what we have said in the division.
Chapter 75.
To teach midwives in what manner living embryos should be treated when they come out in an unnatural position.
It is necessary that the midwife knows at the beginning the signs of natural childbirth, and it is that when you see the woman pushing in the lower parts and desiring to smell the air, and moreover is relieved by what is above her of the birth, and hastens the exit of the embryo, then know that this birth is according to natural position, and its exit is on its head, and the placenta with it or suspended or hanging from the navel.
Therefore when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed so that the embryo descends easily because when it descends on its head, the placenta descends to it, and it is cleansed of those superfluities with good cleansing.
But that which is other than this birth is unnatural and not praiseworthy, because when the embryo has come out on its feet and its body has come out before its head and its feet, and one of its hands, or to one of its feet, or its head has come out and its hand, or to its belly, and very easily it is turned on its neck, and similar to its undesirable positions.
Therefore it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and subtle in all these things, and to guard against error and deception.
And I am showing every position of these, and what skill is in these so that it may be signified by this and may have been upon this.
When the fetus has come out on its head by natural egress, and that is vehement on the woman and difficult birth is made to it, and you see its strength already weakened, then make her sit, or have the women hold her, and steam her vagina with cooked fenugreek and with moist oils.
And afterwards let the midwife introduce between her fingers a small spatula and split with it the placenta, or cut it with her nail until what is in it of moisture runs out. And press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be given an enema of psyllium mucilage and fenugreek mucilage with sesame.
And afterwards command her, after the enema, that she be compressed and make her sneeze with hellebore; and hold her mouth and her nose for an hour, because the fetus will be expelled soon.
And if the two hands of the fetus are expelled at the beginning, then it is necessary that you reduce them with a little facility little by little. But if it does not obey to enter, then place the woman on a chair and raise her feet up, and afterwards shake the chair on the ground; and the woman should be held so that she does not fall towards the shaking.
And if the hands are not turned inside and the fetus dies, then cut them and extract the remainder of the fetus or tie its body to its hand with a cloth and extract it with evenness, because it will be expelled.
When the fetus exits on its feet, then you should push those upwards, and then turn the small fetus, and then straighten it, and then take one of its feet and extend those little by little.
But when they have exited up to the thighs, then you command it to push, and make it sneeze with care, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled with what we have recounted, then you return the fetus little by little until you place it according to its natural position, for it will then be expelled with an easy exit.
And if it is prevented with all that we have recounted, then take marshmallow mucilage and dissolved gum, and pound all in the mortar with good pounding, and then anoint with this the woman's genitals, and the lower part of her belly. And then make her sit in lukewarm water, until it reaches the hypochondria.
And when you see that the parts below her are softened, then give her a fumigation of myrtle and place it under her. And when you have fumigated for an hour, then make her sit on a chair, and then make her sneeze and close her mouth, and lift her, and press the lower part of her belly with light compression, for the fetus will soon be expelled.
Exit of the fetus laterally with one of its hands hanging. Try to reduce its hand, but if you cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her walk.
And if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and shake her thighs with vigorous shaking, and then administer the bindings which I have recounted of mucilages.
And if childbirth has come, then make her sit on a chair, and then work on reducing the hand, and straighten the fetus according to its natural position, and make the woman sneeze and command her to push herself until it is expelled.
Exit of the fetus on its neck with its hands spread and its face to its mother's back. The midwife should hold the fetus's hand and then turn it little by little, and equalize it with ease.
And when it is and how much it is straightened, then place on her genitals what we have recounted of oil and mucilages.
And then command her to move little by little, and when you have done this, then make her sit on a chair and command her to be inclined on the right side, and then command her to push; and make her sneeze with care. Exit of the fetus prepared on its side.
When it descends to the mother's orifice in this manner, consider, and then you cut the afterbirth with your nail until it is evacuated of moisture.
And if the fetus is suspended on its face and neck, then you cut it from the navel, so that it is not retained and dies.
And then push the fetus to the inner parts until you place it as is appropriate, and order the woman to push herself several times, and it will be expelled with an easy exit, if God wills it.
Exit of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born, but this is strange and rarely happens; but five are unnatural, and do not live.
And count them, even if they are multiplied, as one pregnancy, and they are separated by the membrane, distinguishing them between the ligament in the navel of each one. And sometimes they are expelled as is one fetus by natural easy exit, and sometimes they are expelled by undesirable exit as we have recounted.
And if some of them are difficult during childbirth and come to what we have said of unnatural figures, then you cure them as we have recounted.
And let the midwife be subtle and do what she does with ease and subtlety, and with slowness, and be ingenious according to every figure as is prepared for her from the skill bringing to health.
Remembrance of what is formed in the womb from embryos and abortions.
Sometimes one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten are formed in the mother, and it has been verified to me that a woman aborted and expelled six, and another ten all formed, which thing was done by measurement of the glorious wise men.
And all this should be in the knowledge of the midwife for it very easily appears similar to her, and thus opposes itself to that with what is appropriate.
Chapter 76.
On extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you cure the dead fetus with what we have said in the division of medication and it has not come out, and you are forced to use operation by hand, then it is appropriate that you consider if the woman is of sound virtue and is not with any of the accidents by which loss is feared over her.
Then it is appropriate that the woman be laid on the bed on her back, and let her head be inclined downwards and her thighs be elevated.
And the minister holds her from two parts or she is tied to the bed so that her body does not extend towards the extraction of the fetus.
And after you moisten the mouth of her womb with moist oils and with mucilage of marshmallow and fenugreek and linseed.
And after the midwife anoints her hand with those oils and mucilages, and after introduces her hand with ease into the womb, and after searches with the hand for a place in which to fix the hooks in the fetus.
And convenient places for this: then you consider if the fetus is prepared to descend on its head, and then you fix the hooks in its eyes, or in the neck, or in the mouth, or in the palate, or under the chin, or in its fork, or in the places near the ribs, or under the hypochondria.
But if the descent is over its feet, then in the pubic area, or in the middle of the ribs.
And it is appropriate that she hold the hook with the right hand, and place its curve in that place which is between the fingers of the left hand, and introduce the hand with ease and fix the hook in some of those places which we have said, until it reaches the empty thing.
And after place and fix in its apposition another hook, or the third if it is necessary, so that there is equal attraction, and there is not extension according to its straightness only.
Rather it is moved to every part, so that its exit is eased as is done in tooth towards its eradication.
And it is appropriate in it that which is between them that the extension be softened; and if some part of it is retained, then it is appropriate that the midwife anoint some of her fingers with oil and introduce them expertly and revolve with them that which is retained.
Thus if the part of the fetus is expelled, then the hooks are changed to a place which is higher; and do this until all the fetus is expelled.
But if the hand has come out before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it due to its constriction, then it is appropriate that cloth be wrapped over it; and after extract it until it is all expelled, and cut it either at the joint of the hand or at the elbow.
And so it is fitting that you do this with the other hand and with both feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or there is constriction during the exit, or there is water gathered in the head, then it is fitting to insert between the fingers a spiny spatula and split the head and extract the water, or to uncover it with an instrument which is called "alundat", the form of which will come with the forms of other instruments in the chapter which is after this one.
And similarly do if the fetus has a large head by nature: and then it is fitting to incise it with a scalpel, or to take it with the alunda as we have said; and afterwards extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head has exited and is constricted towards the clavicle, then let it be split until the fluid which is in the chest is poured out.
But if it is not complicated, nor obeys to exit, then you incise the head as soon as it will be possible for you.
And if the lower part of the belly is swollen or is in dropsy, then it is fitting that you perforate it until the fluid that is in it runs out.
But if the fetus is on its feet, then the attraction of it is easy and the direction of it to the mouth of the womb is easy.
But if it is constricted towards the belly and chest, then it is fitting that you extract it with a cloth which you will have wrapped over your hand, and that you split the belly and chest until that which is in them runs out.
But if the other members are removed and the head returns, then let the midwife insert the left hand; but if the mouth of the womb is open, then let her insert the hand into the depth of the air, and search with it for the head, and draw it with the fingers to the mouth of the womb, and afterwards insert into it one hook, or two hooks, and draw it with those.
And if the mouth of the womb is constricted by hot swelling which happens to it, then it is fitting that it not be troubled over; rather it is fitting then to administer an effusion of fatty moist things. And administer plasters; and follow the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, then if it is possible, let it be needled: and let that which we have said be administered in the living fetus.
And if that is not possible, then let it be cut into pieces, and let it be extracted.
And it is fitting that you do not leave anything inside of the afterbirth.
And when you will have completed all your operation, then administer that which we have said of the cure in the hot swellings which happen to the womb.
And if flux of blood happens, then descend into styptic waters and administer the other cure.
And I have already seen a woman in whose womb was a dead fetus, and afterwards upon that she was again pregnant, and afterwards the other fetus was dead. It happened to her after a long time a swelling in her navel; and it swelled until it was opened, and began to discharge pus.
And I was called to the cure of it, and medicated it for a long time, and the wound was not consolidated.
Then I placed upon it some things, a plaster of strong attraction, and a bone came out of it, and after some days passed, and another bone came out; and I was very amazed, as in the belly there is no bone.
And then I thought that they were from the bones of the dead fetus.
Therefore I widened the wound, and extracted from it many bones, the woman existing in her best dispositions, and already lived in such a manner for a long time, a little pus ran from it.
And I do not affirm this to be strange, except that in this is science and help to that which the skilled physician administers with the hand for cure.
On the forms of instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
Form of a speculum with which the womb is opened:
This is the form of a clamp in which the books are equalized, to which equalization are two screws at the two extremities of two pieces of wood. However, this screw should be more subtle than a writing instrument, and be made either of yew or boxwood.
And the width of each piece of wood is about two fingers and the margin of each both about one finger, and the length of each is one and a half palms; and in the middle place of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same wood which are already fastened, of which the length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions should be inserted into the mouth of the womb so that it is opened with them when you turn the two aforementioned screws.
Another form similar to that one, more subtle and lighter:
It should be made of yew wood or boxwood according to the likeness of forceps. But at the extremity of it are two additions as you see, and the length of those additions is about one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the womb with them, then you make the woman sit on the bed with feet hanging, opening what is between her thighs. And afterwards open your hand with the instrument as you do with scissors equally according to the quantity you want of the opening of the mouth of the womb until the midwife does what you want.
The form of speculum which the ancients described:
Form of impeller with which the fetus is impelled:
Form of large amisidat with which the large head is crushed
And it is similar to forceps which have teeth at the extremity, as you see, and sometimes it is made long like forceps according to this form, as you see, which have teeth like the teeth of a saw with which it is cut and crushed. Form of small amesidat:
Form of hook having one spine:
Form of hook having two spines:
Form of spatula having two extremities with which the head is cut off:
Form of two wide spatulas:
All these instruments are exercised, and the more the species of it are multiplied and are prepared by the craftsmen, the easier it is for its operation and the higher it is for men by its quantity.
And do not work with these instruments even if it is prepared for you, because the necessity of them is not excusable.
On extraction of the placenta.
When the placenta is retained after childbirth, then you should command the patient to hold her breath, and afterwards make her sneeze with condizi, and press your hand over her mouth and over her nostrils, and if by this it has come out, it is good.
And if not, then take a pot and perforate a hole in the lid and put in it herbs opening the mouth of the womb, such as calamint and rue and anise and chamomile and Arabian sticados and cassia lignea and centaury. All these herbs or some of them should be submerged in water in the pot, and place it over the fire.
And afterwards place a reed tube in the mouth of the womb, and hold it until the vapor comes to the cavity of the womb.
And afterwards make her sneeze as we have said, and the placenta will be expelled with velocity.
But if it remains after this cure and has not come out, then you command the midwife to submerge her left hand in sesame oil or in marsh mallow mucilage, and afterwards insert it into the vagina and search for the placenta with it, and when you have found it, then take it and extend it little by little. But if it is attached in the depth of the womb, then insert her hand as we have recounted, and when she has found the placenta, extract it little by little according to straightness so that the womb does not fall towards the vehement attraction. First, it is necessary that it be moved to the right and left sides with ease.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted, we have already recounted the cure with sneezing and with medication of the pot with herbs.
But if it is not expelled with all the things which we have recounted, then be careful not to tire yourself with repeated attempts at extraction, but instead it is necessary that what has come out of it to the mother's mouth be tied to the woman's thigh, and afterwards apply an ointment and tetrapharmacon to her; for that will cause it to rot after a few days and it will be dissolved and expelled.
But when it rots, a bad odor rises from it to the head and stomach, and this harms the patient; and then it is necessary that fumigations suitable for this be administered.
But some of the Ancients have already tried fumigation with watercress and dried figs.
Form of instrument with which the woman is fumigated for the retention of menses and of the afterbirth:
It should be made of glass or copper.
And the thin end should be placed in the vagina and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation should be placed on the embers of the fire.
And hold it until that fumigation is consumed and repeat with another.
On the cure of an infant's unpierced anus.
Many infants are born and their anuses are not pierced, which have a thin and blocked membrane. Then it is necessary for the midwife to pierce that membrane with her finger; and if not, pierce it with a sharp spatula, and be careful not to touch the muscle.
And afterwards place wool soaked in wine and oil on it; and afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear it may be blocked, then place a cannula in the hole for many days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
And obstruction of the anus can occur through healing of a wound or abscess; then it is necessary that this healed area be cut open, and afterwards be treated with what we have said about the cure and the lead.
On the cure of fistulas that occur below.
The fistulas that occur in the lower part are nodules and swellings which occur near the anus outside or in the space of one part.
And it is one fistula or many.
And when that nodule is old and a white watery fluid or thin pus flows from it, and sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrating.
And those penetrating ones are known by what comes out of them through excretion and flatulence; and sometimes the patient experiences excretion, and very easily a worm comes out of them.
And some of these fistulas are sometimes in the space penetrating to the bladder, and to the urethra; and some of them penetrate to the joint of the thigh and to the tailbone.
And that by which a fistula penetrating to the anus and a non-penetrating one is known, is that you put your index finger in the anus, and insert a thin probe of copper or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert a thin probe of lead or horsehair into it until you feel the probe or the hair with your finger.
And if you don't feel it at all and nothing comes out of the hole like excrement or worm or flatulence, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and then hasten to the cure.
And when the fistula is penetrating to the bladder or to the urethra, then its sign is the exit of urine from it and its prevention from being healed with medicine.
But if it is penetrating to the joint of the thigh or to the bone and there is pain around it, then it is a sign that the probe reaches there if there is no twisting to the bone, and there is pain in the area around the part; and that pus always comes out of it; and that medication does not help, nor is it healed with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure, and the cure of these is the work and vanity of foolish doctors on which they are fixed.
But in that which is not penetrating and not old, healing with iron is expected as I will tell you, and that which I have already proven.
And it is that the patient lies between your hands on his back and raises his legs up, the thighs are inclined to his belly, and then insert a lead or copper probe if there is twisting in the fistula, until you know the place where the probe reaches.
And if the patient feels that around the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
And if you feel with your finger the probe already uncovered penetrating by itself, beyond what you feel between your finger and that membrane or flesh, then know for certain that it is penetrating; and then do not work on it, for there is no healing in it, as we have said.
But some said that it is rarely healed in some men.
And of the medication by which help is expected in it is that you heat a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as has been done before, and insert that heated instrument into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat that two or three times until you know that all those joined fistulated flesh that are similar to a bird’s feather quill have already been burned.
And then treat it with poultices wrapped in cloth until all that burned flesh comes out, and then treat it with medicines that generate flesh and consolidate, and if it is healed, good; and if not, then it is not healed at any time by another cure.
And if the probe enters, and does not penetrate to your finger which is in the anus, and between that and the probe there is a thick veil of flesh or membrane, and you see the fistula in what follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you go cutting with the probe, and let it be in the fistula until the cut reaches the place where the end of the probe reaches, and by the probe it is freed and falls.
And then clean those fistulated flesh which are similar to a bird’s feather quill and let nothing of those remain.
But if you see that a flow of blood comes between you and your operation when you cut those flesh, then the best and lightest instrument is to cauterize with fire or with sharp medicine, for cautery with fire adds two good effects: that is burning of those joined flesh, and stopping of the blood and drying of the humidities.
And then treat it with poultices wrapped in cloth or in crushed lime until the place discharges pus, and then treat the wound with ointments that generate hard flesh and consolidate.
And these are medicines in which there are astringency and drying; when then it is restored it is already healed and you do not fear repetition.
But if the fistula already reaches to the depth of the anus and is elongated from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and investigate with it.
And then if you feel the probe and between you and it is a veil of membrane or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then there is no operation in it except according to the way of trust and hope.
The matter is to administer in one of three ways: either cauterize it as we have said; or cut it until you reach its cavity so that it is possible for you to introduce the instruments and the proper cure; and do not proceed much with cutting so that you do not cut the muscle containing the anus, and that accidental discharge of excrement without will occurs to the patient; and afterwards cure it with what we have said because it will be healed very quickly; or that you elongate that veil and clean it more than you cut it until near the anus, as we have said, or with a probe or with another instrument with a sharp end, and afterwards purify those fistulated flesh which are in the cut up to where you can with encrustation; and afterwards strive to make the restoration of the whole wound with cutting, and if the upper orifice is not consolidated, and the fistula remains open in the part of the anus, it will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula is finished in this way: it is when you introduce the probe into the fistula, and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the skin and on the edge of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like a needle of those who prepare leathers according to this form:
and introduce in it a thread wrapped with five threads or around those; and afterwards introduce the probe with thread into the fistula until it reaches its cavity.
But if it is penetrating in the edge of the anus near inside, then you extract the thread from that hole so that you introduce your finger into the anus; and extract the end of the thread and join the two ends together, and tighten each one, and leave it for a day or two, and when the thread cuts more into the flesh, tighten it well until those flesh are cut which are between two ends of the thread and that fall.
And afterwards cure the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
But if the orifice of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever way it is prepared for you, unless it is very deep, because it is not for you to do that so that you do not cut the muscle; and afterwards do with it until it is healed.
The form of the spiny spatula with which the fistula is split: the curvature of which is very sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that you do not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
About the suture of hemorrhoids in which blood flows in their incision.
Hemorrhoids are of two types, because they are either between the anus resembling as if it were coals, or almost as if they were grape seeds. And of those are small and large, and blood always flows from them and it is one, and they are many, and they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
But however those that are outside the anus are usually of little humidity, from which flows citrine water or a little blood with continuous body, and they are according to the color of the body.
And the cure of that which is inside the anus is that you command the patient to sit and to squeeze until the anus comes out and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you hurry and suspend with hooks or that you hold those with your nail, and afterwards cut those towards their roots.
But if the hooks are not held in those because of their humidity and softening of those, then take those with rough cloth or with cotton or with wool blanket, and extract those with your fingers, and afterwards cut those and sprinkle over them some hot powders after the incision, so that they are to those in place of cautery; or cauterize those as it is preceded in the chapter on cauterizing. And afterwards cure those with the other cure until they are healed.
And if the anus does not obey to excretion, then administer an enema to the patient with a mild irritant, and wash with that what is in the anus so that it obeys to excretion easily when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is easier, and it is that you take them with your nail, or that you take them with a hook, and cut them, and afterwards treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And for those who avoid cutting, it is suitable to administer sutures to them in this manner: take wrapped thread and insert it into a needle and then extract the hemorrhoids to the upper parts, and make it penetrate with the needle into the root of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the thread in the lower part of the needle, and this laterally; and tighten the hemorrhoid with a strong tightening, and afterwards tie the thread and extract the needle.
And do this to all of them, and leave one of them and do not sew it, so that the excess blood flows from it.
And afterwards place on the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or in wax; and place that on the anus and command the patient to rest. And afterwards leave that until it falls; and when it has fallen, treat those with ointments or with other treatment until it is healed.
And when they are old and medicine does not work on them, then it is suitable that you scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your nail until they are made moist and the uppermost layer is removed from them, which prevents them from healing; and afterwards treat them until they are healed.
Then you remove them with more vehement scraping than the first until they bleed a lot and are excoriated; and afterwards treat them until they are healed.
Know that alamermar, that is wart, and it is nothing but round knots according to the color of the body similar to the head of a nail, and it is made in all the body and mainly in the parts below the feet and on the toes, and it causes pain when walking.
And then it is suitable that what is in the circuit of the wart be cut, and be held with tweezers or with a hook, and be eradicated from its root; and afterwards treat it.
And if you want, cauterize it according to what is preceded in its chapter.
But veruca is a small rough fistulated round prominence on the surface of the body, and many times they come on the hands of children.
And its treatment is that you stretch and cut it, or that you tighten it with thread or with hair until it falls. And if you want, cauterize it, as we have said, with fire or with sharp medicine.
But formica is a small felted or fistulated large prominence on the surface of the body going very deep, and when the cold finds it, it is felt in it similar to the bite of an ant, and it is made around the body.
And its treatment is that you take a tube of goose feather or of vulture feather, and it should be strong, and place it on the formica until the circle of the tube contains the parts of it; and afterwards revolve your hand with the tube until you cut what is in the circuit of the formica, and place it in the depth of the flesh, and that you eradicate the formica from its root.
And if you want, do this with a tube of copper or of iron according to this form:
Let the upper part of the tube be drawing to subtlety, deaf (that is, not perforated), wrapped so that on the finger the grasping of it is facilitated and its revolution.
And if you want cauterize the formica according to what is said before in the cauterization of atheyl in the chapter on cautery.
On the form of instruments used to administer enemas.
Sometimes enemas are made of silver, brass, or melted or hammered copper; and sometimes these instruments are made small and large according to those to whom they are administered, for that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small; and for those whose bottoms are weak or painful, their enemas should be small.
The form of large and small enemas:
The upper head of the cannula to which the bag is tied should be wide in this manner; and there should be a distinction where the bag is tied as you see.
And the lower extremity, which is inserted into the bottom, should be smooth (that is, not open) very slender, tending to fineness; and on one side of it should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays and a little thicker.
And the bag in which the medicines are placed should be of animal bladder or sheep skin, and its root should be a palm long.
And it should be perforated by many holes as it is rolled; and if the space between the holes is the thickness of a finger.
And then insert into those holes strong thread of raw thread which should be of ten threads, or thereabouts; and join the bag with it; and when the bag is placed in it, tighten it at the head of the enema between two distinctions with strong constriction, and then administer the enema through each hole: But the quality of administering with it is that you fill the bag with medicine, which should be heated according to the amount the patient can tolerate; and be careful that it is not too hot or too cold.
And then the patient should lie on his back, and raise his legs up and place underneath him a leather on which men have already lain or a sheet; and then anoint the extremity of the enema with oil or egg white or with mucilage of fenugreek or similar; and then insert it into the bottom with ease, and then the minister should take the bag and squeeze it with both hands and together with force until all that is in the enema is evacuated into the bowel; and then remove the enema and the patient raises his legs to the wall.
And if the medicine forces him to evacuate, let him hold it as long as he can; and if he sleeps with it for a whole night, it is more beneficial.
But if you administer an enema to him for illnesses of looseness of the belly and the evacuation hurries him, then you repeat the enema until he is healed.
And if in the bottom there are hemorrhoids or painful swellings, then let the enema be very fine and slender, of the enemas with which children are treated.
On the treatment of wounds.
I have already said in the division of the treatment of wounds what was appropriate to the book, and I say here the treatment of those by hand and with medicines according to the completion.
Therefore I say that wounds are diverse according to what the wounds are made in and according to the place on which the wounds fall.
And the causes by which wounds are often made are such as throwing of stone, or cutting with sword or knife, or striking with lance, or with sticks, or with arrow, or similar to those of many things.
But the wounds that are in the places of the body are such as a wound which falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the liver, and similar to those of the limbs.
And I am recounting the treatment of some wounds so that you may apply that reasoning and rule to other wounds.
And I will begin with simple wounds of the head, for the remembrance of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
So I say that when you encounter a simple wound on the head and there is no fracture, then consider: if it is from a stone throw or similar, and has only broken the skin and is a large wound, and you fear a hot abscess may form on that patient, then you hurry and bleed the cephalic vein immediately, and do not delay this; and extract blood from him according to the strength of his virtue if there is nothing prohibiting bloodletting, especially if the blood that has come out of the wound is little.
And let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the wounded part; and let the patient guard against repletion and wine and heavy foods.
But if something prohibits the bleeding, then let the food be reduced and do not approach meat or wine.
And place on the wound, if a hot abscess occurs, cotton soaked in rose oil alone or in wine in which it is styptic.
But if you are sure of a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is recent with its blood and the air has not changed it, the powder which I will recount shortly.
And if the air has already changed it, then place some ointments on it until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or is from a sword cut and similar, and the lips of it are not joined by small stitches, then join those with sutures according to what I will recount about their suturing.
But if the wound is already uncovered to the bone and hanging, and there is no retention of it except a small suspensory, then cut it and afterwards cure the wound with medicines and restore the flesh afterwards in place of skin, and command the patient to be fed with foods in which there is thickness: heads and cooked wheat and similar to them, until it is composed.
And if you find putrefaction in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, then you cut all that is rotten and throw it away, and afterwards cure it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flow can occur, and it is not cut off by medicines, then you inquire about the artery, and if you find it uncut, then you cut it with a spatula, or tie it; and if necessity provokes you that what we have said does not confirm, then you cauterize until the blood is cut off.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is light; so that you powder over them this powder, for it consolidates them before the air changes them.
And the manner of the powder is this: take one part incense oil, two parts dragon's blood, three parts unslaked lime; let all be very well ground and sifted, and let the wound be filled with it, and be constrained by good constriction until it adheres well to it, and be coagulated with the blood.
And afterwards tighten it above with small cloths and leave it, and do not untie it while it remains so that it is not abscessed, for the medicine is not eradicated from it until it is healed.
And sometimes lime alone does this, when you do not have incense and dragon's blood present.
And this same operation is already done in large wounds when it is convenient that it be placed on them and they are tightened, and they are recent wounds with their blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, and especially when it is in summertime, then there is no intention to the position of this powder, but then cure them with what we have said, so that you place on them some digestive ointments, or that you place on them powder of barley flour with water and honey until they throw out rottenness; and afterwards cure them with the other cure until they are healed.
But if a fracture in the bone occurs with the wound, and it is small, then you extract it with gestures.
And I will say the cure of the fractures of the head in what is to come.
Of the wounds of the neck.
But if the wound happens in the neck, then there is no difference in medication, and between the wound of the head when it is simple.
But if already the nerve of the neck is cut or an artery, then if it is a nerve, there is no remedy except to avoid treating it with that which causes strong stypticity, such as zinc and vitriol which are similar to them because they harm the nerves and contract them. And do not put on the wound anything completely cold, because the substance of the nerves is cold and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest of all the members.
And if it is that which is cured with light medicines, such as lime washed with sweet water, sometimes infused in rose oil or non-rose oil, and tutty when it is washed with sweet water and the other mineral stones according to this manner, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or bring together its lips, and afterwards cure it with pledgets until it is healed.
But if the wound has depth or rot happens in it in the lowest part, then perforate it in the most depressed place.
But if in the wound an artery is already cut and a flow of blood follows, then separate or dry it, or tie it, or cauterize it if necessity provokes you to do so.
But if it has already cut the vertebrae of the throat or all, and the veins of the neck are saved, then you join the lips of the skin with sutures over the throat pipe and do not touch it; instead, equalize it and reduce it to its natural figure, and afterwards tighten it with decent tightness, and leave it for some days; and afterwards cure it with ointments in which there is stypticity and stimulation until it is healed.
But if the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it, and then if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all those that you can of them; and that which is not prepared for you, leave it until the wound rots, and be separated and its severity be alleviated.
And if the wound is recent then sprinkle over it the powder which I have recounted to you. But if in the wound a fistula is made, then cure it with that which the remembrance will come after in its chapter.
If it is a blow from a lance or knife, and you see its depth, then consider more if from the wound comes windiness when the patient breathes; then know that the wound is mortal.
And if in it there is no depth and the wound is recent with its blood, then you put in it from the first hour powder, and do not tighten it so that the blood is not retained in its depth and that it returns to the heart and kills the patient, but put in it attractive ointment, and untie it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not present to you, then you put in the orifice of the wound old cotton so that it sucks that which comes out of the humidities; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that runs that which is gathered in it.
But if already three days or more have passed from the wound and spasm does not happen to the patient nor tremor of bad heart nor tightness of breath, and you see the other good dispositions of it, then know that the wound is safe; and then cure it with poultices and with the other cure until it is healed.
But if its healing is excused, and it is already always open, then know that a fistula has already been made; cure it then by its chapter.
And if the wound is by incision of sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then cure it with that which is preceded by suture, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has already made an impression on the bone, and pieces are already cut from it, then you clean the wound and hasten to extract those pieces, if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound rots, so that their extraction is alleviated.
And of the other wounds happening in the other members, the help in curing is the help of that which we have said.
On the wounds of the belly.
The discomfort which occurs in the belly is either great, or small, or moderate.
And a small rupture is made difficult in another way, and it follows that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not hurry to introduce them to their place immediately, because it opens and swells so that its entry becomes difficult.
And so the best rupture is moderate, for in that one the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in the two species mentioned before.
And know that suturing of the belly is done in four ways, but two sutures are common that are suitable for suturing other wounds of the body.
And two other sutures specific to communicating with other wounds, but they are more specific in suturing the belly.
And I recount to you each with exposition and declaration.
So I say that when the wound is small and something of the intestine has come out through it, and it is made difficult to reduce it, then it is in one of two ways: either by smallness of the rupture as we have said, or when swelling has come to the intestine due to the coldness of the air.
And so when it is like this, then it is necessary that you warm it so that you submerge a sponge or damp cloth in lukewarm water alone, or that you cook in water squinant, and cyperus, and spike, and you bathe with that the intestine until the swelling is resolved.
And sometimes wine does this in which there is astringency, and it is better than water alone in resolving the swelling.
And so when you see the swelling being resolved, then you moisten the intestine with water in which althaea and mallows are cooked, for by this its entry is eased with little effort.
But if its entry is excused after this treatment, then cut the rupture a little with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better, when it is appropriate than cutting is not, and there should not be occupation to dry after necessity and failure.
Of the instrument, its form follows:
One part of it curved and sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the extremity subtle, and not with the subtlety of a spatula, rather it should be a little blunt.
And so when the wound is enlarged and the intestine comes out, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form, in its proper place, if it is possible above this, for it is better.
But when the rupture is wide, and is in the lower part of the belly, then it is necessary that you make the patient lie on his back, and place his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the upper part of the belly, then you place his head and chest higher than the lower parts.
And similarly if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your intention and your consideration always on this so that the part in which the wound is is higher than the other.
And so it is necessary that you administer this in great wounds and in moderate wounds.
And in small wounds, place what is prepared for you, and afterwards make the minister be between your hands carefully, who holds the whole rupture with his hand and joins its lips, and afterwards uncover from it to the one who follows the suture something after another.
And this is the manner of common suture: one where you take the needle, or count of needle according to the quantity of the width of the wound; and after leave from the extremity of the disruption of the ring finger, and tighten the needle one, other that you do not put thread in the two extremities of the skin, with two extremities of the peritoneum which is under the skin of the inner parts, until you make it penetrate from that part; and you have already gathered two extremities of the skin and two extremities of the peritoneum, and so made four orders.
And after tighten with double thread in the circuit of the needle, and sometimes from two parts together, and after gather the two lips and the wound by decent gathering; and after leave the thickness of the finger and stick another needle in it, and after tie it with thread as you did with the first needle; and do not cease to do this if it is necessary with the needles until you have completed all the contraction of the wound.
And let the needles be medium between thickness and thinness, for very thin needles easily cut the flesh; and the thick ones are difficult to enter the skin, and therefore for this it is suitable that they be medium in thinness and thickness.
And it is not suitable that the needle be stuck in two extremities of the skin very close, so that the flesh is not easily cut and that the wound opens before its consolidation.
And they should not be prolonged from suture so that the wound is not prohibited from consolidation.
And after cut the extremities of the needles so that they do not hurt the patient towards his sleep; and you will put over the suture expanded pads from all parts, which hold the extremities of the needles; and leave those until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
And these species of suture with needles in which manner is more convenient in small wounds, for it suffices in the suture of them one needle or two or around those.
But the second suture is common: and it is that you administer with suture the four extremities, of the skin and two extremities of the peritoneum, in one time, with needle in which is thread wrapped equal in thinness and thickness.
And after when with the needle you will have penetrated these four extremities, reduce the needle from that same part from which you began, so that the retracted thread falls from the highest part to the wound, so that the suture is according to suture of cloth with which the cloths are tightened.
And put between each suture the quantity of the thickness of the little finger.
And this suture men know.
And with such suture I sewed the wound which had happened to a man in his belly who had been wounded with a knife, and the disruption of the wound was greater than a palm, and about two palms of the middle intestine had come out and the disruption was in the middle of the member; and then I reduced that after the intestine had been outside the wound for 24 hours.
And the wound was consolidated in the space of 15 days or around, and I cured that and it is healed; and after that he lived for many years, and is conversed in his dispositions.
And the other doctors had judged that he would not be healed; and by miracle it was, for I did not cure that with ointment, for it was in a place in which ointment was not found nor any medicine, but I put over the wound old cotton twice a day and assiduous ablution with honey water until it was healed.
But I will say two species of proper suture according to narration of Word.
And it is that you begin with suture of the skin, and introduce needle from the outside part to the inside part.
And so, as the needle penetrates the skin and into the same muscle according to the straightness and length of the whole body, and leaves the extremity of the peritoneum in which you have inserted the needle; and make it penetrate from the inside to the outside at the other extremity of the abdominal wall.
And when you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate again at that same extremity of the abdominal wall from the outside to the inside; and leave the extremity of the peritoneum which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate at the other extremity from the inside to the outside.
And make it penetrate with your penetration with which you make it penetrate the peritoneum at the extremity of the abdominal wall which is on the side of it until it all penetrates.
And afterwards begin from this same side and sew it with the extremity that is of the peritoneum on the other side, and extract the needle from the skin which it penetrated, and afterwards return it to that skin and sew the extremity of the peritoneum which is on the other side with this extremity of the abdominal wall; and extract it from the skin which is on the side of it.
And do this once and again, and do this once after another time until you sew all that which is outside according to that example.
And the sum of this manner of suture is that you sew with a suture of skins with which they sew skins, so that you sew the peritoneum once from the part of the extremity of the skin, and that you leave it another time until you have completed it.
But the second species of proper suture which Galen also said, and this is from his discourse and recounted by him, is that you sew it according to the similarity with which some doctors sew it, so that they aggregate every part to its comparable part convenient to it by nature; and applying the extremity of another to it and the extremity of the abdominal wall to another extremity of it, and this is done according to what I recount to you.
It is appropriate that you fix the needle in the extremity of the abdominal wall closest to you from the outside, and make it penetrate to the inside in that sole, and leave two extremities of the peritoneum; and afterwards turn the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside in two extremities of the peritoneum.
And afterwards turn each of those, and make each penetrate from the inside to the outside in two other extremities of the abdominal wall that are on the opposite side.
And this manner of suture is better than the common light suture, and is a suture of which remembrance preceded.
This is the discourse of Galen
And moreover some said, suture of the belly is rectified with two needles, that is that you insert in these to each a thread, and begin with insertion of needle from what is towards you, and make it penetrate until the other side according to suture of those who sew leathers equally.
And know that when disruption is in the middle place of the belly, then the suture of it is more difficult than of the other places of the belly.
But the judgment of medication of wound is judgment of the other wounds.
Which thing is because when you follow the recent wound with its blood before the air alters it, and reduce the intestine and sew it and fit it decently, then place incarnative powder on it.
And if the air has already altered the wound, then place on it some ointments which are present to you until they make a hard stone and the threads fall, and peritoneum and abdominal wall are consolidated; and afterwards cure it as is the cure of other wounds until it is healed.
But if the medicines are not present for you, then place immediately on it, as soon as it begins to discharge pus, old cotton, and change it twice a day, as has been taught to you, until it is healed, for you do not need other medication in many cases when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound might communicate injury to the main members, then it is appropriate that you submerge sheep's wool in oil of moderate quality, or in rose oil, and place it around the areas that are between the groins and under the armpits.
And if he feels pain or putrefaction in his bowels, for this happens many times, then give him an enema with lukewarm black astringent wine, especially if the rottenness has reached the intestine and has made a penetrating exit to its cavity.
And know that that which is of the large intestine is of easier healing than that which is in the small intestines.
And it is of difficult healing because the intestine which is called "jejunum" does not receive healing of a wound that falls in it at all; and this is because of the great multitude of veins that are in it and because of the magnitude of those that are in them, and because of the subtlety of its body, and because of its proximity to the nature of nerves.
But if what proceeds from the wound is the membrane, and you catch it fresh, reduce it according to your straightness with which you equally reduce the intestines.
But if it has passed to it space and has already become green or black, then you should tighten it with thread above the place that is blackened of it, so that blood flow comes, for in the membrane there are veins and arteries.
And after, cut what is beyond that binding, and place two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it, so that the attraction of it towards the falling of the membrane and the emission of pus from the wound may be alleviated for you.
Remembrance of the wounds when they happen in the intestine.
When disruption occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some men, because I saw one who had been wounded in his belly with a blow from a lance and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old and had become a fistula, and discharge and gas came out of it.
Then I pursued his cure although I was not confident in his healing, but I continued to treat him subtly until he was healed and the place was consolidated.
And I, after I saw the place already consolidated, feared for the patient that a bad accident might happen to him in his belly; and no bad accident happened because of this and he remained in his best dispositions eating and drinking, and afterwards he entered a bath and exercised in his sayings.
And some experienced ones have already said that when a wound happens in the intestine, and it is small, then it is appropriate that it be bound according to this manner: and it is that you take ants with big heads; and after join the two lips of the wound and place one of those ants that has its mouth open over the two lips of the wound; then when it takes hold of them and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and is not dissolved.
And after place another ant near the first, and do not cease to do this with ants one after another according to the quantity of the whole wound.
And after reduce it and sew the wound; and let those heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is healed; and no harm happens to the patient.
And it is already possible that the intestine be tied with subtle thread which is made from the intestine of an animal attached to it, after it is put in a needle; and it is that you take the end of these intestinal threads, and let it be very lean, and after tie its end with flax thread, wrapped, and after introduce that thread into needles and sew with it the intestine, and reduce it in the disruption.
And this manner of suture with ants is only according to the way of trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, for then there is no device except subtlety, and there is no healing of it at all.
On the treatment of abscesses and fistulas.
Know that every wound and abscess, when it becomes old and chronic, and turns into an ulcer, and is not healed and constantly discharges pus and is not cut out, then, in whatever part it may be, is universally called a fistula and we call it a zukem.
And a fistula, in truth, is a hard, white, felted knot which is not painful and which has a cavity like the hollow of a bird’s feather; and for this reason some call it rizatz, that is, a feather.
And in some people it is moist, discharging pus; and very easily the moisture is cut off at certain times. And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and it is scarce, and it is thick, and it is thin.
I have already shown all these causes, and their signs and their cure with medicines in the division.
And it is appropriate here that I make known to you the cure of fistula which is done by way of operation with the hand.
And know that fistula occurs in all the parts of the body; for of these are fistulas that reach to the great veins and arteries, or to the nerves, or to the peritoneum, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to one of the ribs, or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the joints composed by composition such as of the hand and of the foot; and of these are those that give to it proximity of the principal member and of similar ones.
And therefore that of these fistulas which is according to this manner is of the diseases of difficult healing, and does not receive cure, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
And if there is of the fistulas one the depth of which does not reach to these places that I have said, and you hope and trust in the cure of it, and you want to come to knowledge of it, then take a probe of copper or of iron, and if the fistula goes according to straightness, and you investigate it with it.
But if the fistula is tortuosity, then investigate it with a probe of subtle lead, for lead with the lightness of its body is lightened and curved towards the tortuosity.
And if the fistula is having many orifices, it is not possible for you that you signify upon it with a probe.
Then irrigate the orifice through its orifices, for the moisture with which you irrigate it goes towards the other orifices and flows from them.
And afterwards inquire exquisitely, according to which manner it is possible for you that you know if there you have bone or nerve, and if the cavity of the fistula is far or near, or if it is one fistula to which there are many orifices and it stands upon this all with the sum of your strength, with your interrogation, with which you interrogate the patient, and the invention of the pain towards your compression with the hand upon the place, and similar of the significations and of the causes happening to the abscess.
And when you will have stood upon all these causes with true standing, then go to the cure according to confidence: and it is that you consider then if it is an apparent fistula near or in a safe place, far from a joint, or from a nerve, or from an artery, or from a vein, or from one of the places which I have told you.
Then you dry the fistula according to what is said before of the narration of it, and remove that which is in that filtration and of corrupted flesh, and that which is born in the orifice of the flesh, or of skin and of similar things, and cure it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth, and is straight, then it is necessary that you cut it as deep as possible, and afterwards clean it of all its corrupted flesh; and then administer some wrappings with strong medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula, which you have probed with iron.
And do this with it several times until the strong medicine corrodes all that remains of the corruption in the cavity of the fistula.
And afterwards restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have described.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you have confirmed this, then you investigate it and dry it as we have described, if you do not prohibit any cause of vein or nerve or principal member as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then you scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and afterwards treat it with that which makes it flesh until it is healed.
And if it is not healthy and discharges pus as it did before, then know that you have not achieved the complete eradication of the corruption; and then you uncover it again and carefully perform the scraping and cleansing of it with your utmost strength, and afterwards restore it.
And so if it is healed, it is good; and if not, then know that this corruption is in the deep recesses of the body, which has not been reached, and then for you in that case there is no solution but to leave it.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to extract it, then you extract it with fine forceps which are suitable for this.
And if there are many bones, then carefully perform the extraction of all of them, and of those do not leave any with your strength.
But if any cause of moisture creates a problem for you, and in their incision there is no fear or error, then cut those ligaments or flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at this time, then place on the wound that which will rot that wound, and leave it until that is around those bones of flesh and ligaments, and guard the wound so that it is not consolidated, and let the section which you have cut in your operation be constricted.
Before, if you fear, place on it cotton soaked in sulfur ground with oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in one of the green ointments, because when those ligaments rot, and the bones are separated from them by removal, and their extraction is eased.
But if it is a large bone such as the bone of the leg or thigh or similar to those, and that which is corrupted of it is only its surface, then scrape it with only the last scraping until that blackness and corruption is removed, and afterwards restore the wound.
But if that which is corrupted of it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to enclose it and cut it all until the place where the corruption has reached, and then treat it until it is consolidated.
And I tell you that which happened to a man in his thigh so that you may use it as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a young man about 30 years old, who experienced pain in his thigh, and from the inner parts it moved over the matter inside the body until the matter reached the thigh, and it is the matter of an abscess with a large swelling, and it was not caused by something external.
And then the time was extended with that due to the error of the doctors until the abscess opened, and many materials flowed from it, and its cure was postponed until the leg became fistulated, and many orifices were made in it which all discharged pus and bodily fluids.
And then a multitude of doctors treated him for about two years, and there was no wise hand in the art among them, until I was called.
And I saw his leg and the materials that were flowing from those orifices in great quantity; and already the body of that man was all emaciated and his color was yellow.
And then I inserted the probe into one of those orifices and the probe reached the bone.
And afterwards I examined all the orifices and found that they reached their destination from all parts of the leg.
And then I hurried and cut over one of those orifices until I uncovered a part of the bone, and I found it corrupted, and it was already earthy and corrupted and blackened; and a part of the leg was already corrupted until it had penetrated to the marrow.
And then I sawed what was uncovered and prepared of the exposed bone.
And I thought that there was nothing in the bone but that corruption which I had cut away and sawed, and I had already uprooted it.
And afterwards I applied the restoration of the wound with consolidating medicine for a long time, and it did not heal.
And afterwards I repeated and uncovered the bone a second time over the first uncovering, and I found continuous corruption with the bone.
And I sawed what appeared to me of that corruption, and afterwards I was forced to make the cure and restoration of it, and it was not restored.
And then I uncovered it again and did not cease to cut the bone little by little, bit by bit, and forced its restoration, and it was not restored until I cut about a palm's length of it, and extracted it with its marrow, and afterwards I restored it with medicines, and it healed easily and was cured.
And repetition in its operation and cutting was not necessary except for the disposition of his weakness and for the scarcity of his tolerance and his fear of death, for he would faint at all hours due to excessive evacuation.
And thus he is healed by complete healing, and hard flesh was born in place of the bone; and his disposition in his body was made good and his strength returned; and he went about his affairs and it did not cause him any difficulty in walking or harm in any way.
But if there is a protruding bone in a place of the body already pierced, then you should cut it in this manner: take a binding and tighten it at the end of that protruding bone, and command someone to extend it upwards; and place that binding of wool thicker than the first binding; and afterwards tie it over the flesh that is below the bone, and extend its extremity so that you draw the flesh to the lower parts, and you uncover the flesh over the place which you want to saw so that the saw does not harm the flesh.
And place wood or a board below the bone decently, for when you do this the saw is not prevented from cutting the corrupted flesh.
And the sawing should be done over the corrupted place little by little, for if there is corruption in the concavity of the bone and it does not appear in its appearance to the senses, it forces another sawing of it.
If the bone is corrupted and not prominent, before one part is continuous with the other, and the corruption is in the middle or in part of it, then you uncover all the flesh from all parts; and afterwards place wood underneath, and then saw that from the first part where the corruption is until the cut is continuous with the other part.
And let the cut be according to the location of the corruption a little, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, cut that corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it is continuous with the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no reason in it except ingenuity.
And if the corruption is in the chest of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; however, it is necessary that you investigate the corruption in whatever manner it appears to you, and that you abrade it, and clean it according to each disposition which is possible for you, and with each ingenious method it is rectified for you, when vein or nerve does not pose a challenge to you.
And know that the cutters and saws to cut these bones are many according to the situation of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their subtlety and their size and their smallness, and their hardness and their rarity; therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation an instrument suitable for that operation.
And know that this operation indicates to you about the kind of instrument which you need; when you have great study and long and knowledge of the manners of this art, and testimony of manners of illnesses, for then you already have for yourself what is suitable of instruments for every illness.
And I am forming for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will place as examples with which you will proceed to your prohibition which you will experiment on others. Shape of saw:
Shape of another saw:
Shape of another large saw:
Shape of file: Let the head of this file be according to the shape of a star-shaped nail head, and its points be according to the shape of the points of alstefegi.
And it is only suitable that with it are rubbed the heads of the joints when they are corrupted, or the mouth is large and wide.
Shape of smaller razor:
Shape of wide razor:
Shape of another decently made saw: let its upper arc be made and its sharpness of iron, and its handle of wood decently made dagger. Its shape:
Shape of razor which has a concavity:
Shape of another subtle razor:
Shape of another razor with curved extremity:
Shape of small razor similar to a probe:
Shape of another smaller cutter:
Shape of another cutter; this similar to a file, and its extremity is like a saw, and it is exhibited in many places in the cutting of bones:
Shape of file which is suitable for filing of that which is perforated of bones:
And its extremity is triangular and with a sharp end.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly it is necessary that all the things that we have said of razors and cutters and saws.
On the incision of extremities and the sawing of bones.
The extremities rot either due to internal or external causes, or when you have treated that corruption with the cure of those medicines and the cure does not work, or you see the corruption spreading to the limb which you did not strike for any reason, then it is necessary that you cut that limb up to where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may escape death or malice which is a greater weakness of the limb.
And the sign of that which happens is that the limb becomes black until it seems that it was already burned, or it rots after the blackness until that rot spreads to the limb that follows it and takes over the whole body; and then hurry with the incision of that.
And similarly if the cause of the corruption is the strike of some venomous things such as sea scorpion or viper or spider and similar ones.
And if the corruption or the strike is at the extremity of the finger, then you cut the finger and do not give space to the corruption to spread to the hand.
And similarly if it reaches the hand, then you cut it from the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption until it takes over the bone of the arm.
And if it invades that, then cut the arm up to the elbow at the joint.
And if the corruption passes beyond and you see it around the elbow, then in that is the death of the patient; and administering anything else for cure is a matter of virtue.
And similarly do with the foot when corruption invades the toe, then you cut it up to one of the knuckles.
And if it takes over the instep of the foot, then you cut the whole foot. But if it rises up to the knee, then you cut the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no solution but dismissal, and leaving the patient to death.
The manner of cutting the limb or sawing it is that you tighten the binding in the lowest part where you want to cut, and tighten another binding above the place; and the minister extends a binding to the parts below, and the minister extends another binding above; and you separate the flesh which is between two bindings with a wide spatula until all the flesh is uncovered; and afterwards it is cut or sawed.
And it is necessary that a linen cloth be placed on all sides so that it does not touch the healthy place, and that no added injury and hot swelling come to the patient.
But if blood flow occurs when you work, then you cauterize the place quickly, or place on it some powders that restrict the blood; and afterwards return to your medication until it is complete.
And afterwards bind the wounded limb with a suitable binding, and treat it until it is healed.
And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, this same accident which I have told you about, which is that blackness occurred in his foot with a burning that resembled a fire burn.
And that corruption occurred first in his toe until it spread to the whole foot.
And then that man prepared himself, as he saw the treatment going to the limb with the vehemence of what he found of pain and burning of it, and he cut that foot up to the joint, and was healed.
A long time later, that same corruption occurred in the index finger of his hand.
And then he came to me, and I tried to repel that excess with what I placed on the hand of medicines, after the purification of his body; and the excess is not repelled and began to go to another finger until it began in the hand.
And he called me to cut his hand, and I did not want to do that hoping for the repulsion of that excess, and more that I feared towards the cutting of his hand death, because the strength of the patient was declining.
And after he despaired of me, he returned to his land and it came to me that that man prepared and cut his whole hand, and is healed.
And I have not brought this narration except that it be help on what falls from this disease, and that it be a sign by which it is signified and according to which it is worked.
On the cure of sinuses and the quality of clysterization with medicines.
When a swelling occurs in some fleshy members and the space of the swelling is prolonged until it makes a collection of pus, and afterwards it is broken and perforated, and the pus has come out of it, and the place remains empty as if it were a vessel, and the skin that is above it as if a thin cloth, and has not reached to the last corruption, and does not impress on the bone or on nerve or on ligament, it is called a sinus, and is not named fistula.
But however if the space is prolonged until the corruption impresses on some member, then it is called fistula and not sinus.
And the cure of it is that you cut all that skin just as it is revolved, and especially when it is thinned and is made like cloth, and you trust that it does not adhere to the place by its corruption.
But if you hope that the skin adheres and that that corruption has not achieved by last achievement, and in the skin there is thickness of face, then you cure that with clyster.
And it is that you consider the sinus, and then if it is large, and the pus that comes out is of fetid odor, then clysterize that with Egyptian medication which is of oil and vinegar and ziniar receiving equal parts, and let them be added in one vessel, and let them be cooked over the fire until the medication becomes red and reaches the thickness of honey.
And afterwards you take from it what is necessary and dissolve it with water and honey; and clysterize with that the sinus, and tighten the orifice of it, and leave the medicine in it for the quantity of two hours.
And then extract that with a probe; and do this for so many days until the sinus is cleaned and the odor is removed.
And sometimes it is cleansed with ash water, when this medicine is not available to you; and it is that you take vine ash, and put it on water; and then strain it and cleanse it with it until you are confident that the sinus is then removed.
And if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine nor the ash water, then cleanse it with water and honey and as if mixed with ground ginger, and cleanse it with wine and mixed honey, for it is the property of honey to cleanse and wash, and the wine makes the sinus adhere, and especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you do this sometimes and you are confident that the sinus is already removed, then cleanse it with that which makes flesh grow in it.
And it is that you take diaphoenicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or that you cleanse it with some other medicines and ointments that have the properties which I have already written in the treatise on ointments.
And if the orifice of the sinus is narrow in which the cannula of the enema is not received, then you widen it little by little with iron, and put in it something wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment until it is widened.
And similarly if the orifice is wide, then you bring together its lips with suture and leave of it a quantity in which the enema enters without addition.
And if the orifice of it from which the pus flows is elevated to the upper parts, then dry it in the lowest place that is in it so that the pus flows down to the bottom, for when the pus is confined in the depth of the sinus the flesh is generated in it.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus to around the lowest bone as you wish, then force yourself to prepare the member with a preparation by which the pus flows from it easily as is prepared for you and that nothing of the pus is retained in it.
But that which is over the orifice of the sinus, which you remove every time so that what is gathered in it of the pus comes out. And so that you know if what flows from it of the pus is much or little, or is digested, or is undigested.
And with this you consider the place of that sinus, if the patient feels pain in it or not, and if there is an abscess in it.
And when your medication is prolonged in such a manner, and you see the matter that is thrown on the orifice of the sinus already adhering, or is approaching adherence, then in the morning you unbind it or on the third day, and when you unbind the wound, then change the cloth for another and renew the ointment.
But if from the sinus after a long space thin virus comes out, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching, for there are some men in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is delayed, and of those there are in whom the contrary of it is done.
And if from the sinus after many days undigested pus comes out, then know that the sinus does not adhere; and if the adherence of the sinus is delayed and the cause is prolonged, then you add in drying of the medicines, and if the medicines are moist in their substance and in their virtue, they are dry like dyafinicon ointment, when there is added to it excess addition of zinc.
And the last way with which it is cured, is that you take dyafinicon ointment and it is dissolved in rose oil, and old wine equal in its substance is poured over it, and afterwards mix that with it, and use that.
And it already makes similar in that action, when there is no pus, dyafinicon ointment, honey when it is cooked until it is thickened, and use it; or that you take myrrh and aloe and incense, and grind all and pulverize over the honey when it is on the fire, and afterwards spread that on a cloth and tighten it over the sinus; and spread that with the honey which you have cooked until it is thickened, and pulverize on cloth and tighten it.
And sometimes they are administered with it long aristolochia and root of celestial lily (and it is celestial lily) and flour of vetch and centaury, and use those simples or combined, grind those and sift and pulverize over the honey which I have recounted; and use it.
And if the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this cure, then know that the corruption is in the depth of it, and already makes inquiry in the bones or in the other hard members or to the ligaments; then you cure it with fistular cure, as is said above.
On the cure of whitlow and bruised nail and incision of added finger and section.
Whitlow is an abscess which is born under the nail of the thumb of the hand or of the foot, and very easily born in the other fingers, and when it is prolonged and its cure is less prized, or it is abscessed from hot abscess, or it is corrupted, and throws pus until it corrodes the root of the nail, and very easily corrupts all of it, and very easily its corruption reaches the bone until it has a fetid odor, and the extremity of the finger is made wide, and its color is made dark.
And so when you will have that with what we have said in the division and you do not complete your cure, then it is fitting that you cut with iron all the superfluity that is remaining of the nail and afterwards cauterize the wound after that, for cautery is very helpful in this.
But if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, and the empty additions of the nail already compress the flesh to the parts within, and begin to prick it and injure it, then it is fitting that you place a subtle ray under the angle of the nail that pricks the flesh, and push it up and cut that flesh with ease, and place over that which remains of the flesh burning corrosive medicines until it is all removed; and afterwards cure that with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption already impresses on the bone, then it is fitting that you cut that bone and extract it, for at no time is it healed that the corrupted bone be in it.
And if you see the corrosion and the corruption going into the finger, then you cut it at one of the knuckles according to what is promised its remembrance, and afterwards cure that until it is healed.
But if to the nail happens percussion or attrition, and happens in it vehement pain, then it is fitting that you at the beginning bleed the patient, and afterwards dry the nail with sharp spatula with transverse section from above downwards, and guard yourself that the section does not reach to the flesh that is under the nail, for you will make happen to the patient vehement pain, and it will be cause to birth of superfluous flesh added in the place; and afterwards cure that place with that which yields pain.
But it is said together, which is born in the hands of some men, very easily it becomes all fleshy, and very easily there are bones in it, or very easily it is in the nail.
And some of them are born in the root of the joint, or their birth is in some knuckles of the fingers. But that which is born in some knuckles of the finger does not move, and this which is born in the joints very easily is moved.
And of those that are born fleshy, the cutting is easy, and it is that you cut that towards its root with a wide spatula.
But of that which is born in the root of the joint, the cure is difficult; and therefore beware of cutting it off.
But in that which is born in the finger towards the knuckles, it is fitting that you cut at the beginning its flesh with a round incision up to the bone, and afterwards saw with one of those saws suitable for this, and afterwards cure it until it is healed.
But consolidation which happens to the fingers among themselves many times either by birth of the man who is born thus, or by consolidation of a wound or by burning of fire, or by similar things, then it is fitting that you cut that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
And afterwards place between them linen cloths soaked in rose oil so that they are not easily consolidated, and separate between them, or place between them a thin lead plate until it is consolidated as it should be.
And similarly if consolidation happens in some fingers with the palm, then you dry that consolidation according to what is prepared and suitable to the shape of the member.
On the incision of varicose veins.
Varicose veins are swollen and twisted veins full of melancholic superfluities which come to many parts of the body, and most commonly occur in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers, laborers, and porters.
Thus it is appropriate that you administer a purging of the body of black bile sometimes with strong expulsion, and afterwards bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
But their cure with iron is according to two methods: one is that they be incised and that black blood be drawn out, and the other method is that the vein be elevated and extracted entirely.
The section of it is according to this method: first bathe the leg with very hot water until the thick blood is dissolved, which is the impurity of the leg, and then tighten the patient's leg from the uppermost part of the thigh to the part below the knee with a bandage, and then cut the vein in one place, or in two, or in three with a wide incision, and then elevate the black blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg up to the top, and from top to bottom, until the amount of blood you want has come out and that you see is sufficient, and which the patient's strength can tolerate.
And then bind it, and command him to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
And repeat the cure by phlebotomy when the veins are filled and this harms the patient.
But the elevation of them is according to this method: you who shave the patient's leg, if there are many hairs on it, and then put him in a bath and bathe his leg with hot water until it reddens and the veins are swollen; or let him be exercised by strong exercise, if a bath is not available to you, until the limb is heated.
And then cut the skin in line with the vein by an incision lengthwise or behind it towards the knee, or in the lowest part of it towards the heel.
And then open the skin with hooks and flay the vein from all sides until it appears to the touch, and it is towards its appearance that you see it red inclining to black.
And then as you remove it and see it from the skin, you see it white almost like a cord.
And then you put the probe under it until it is elevated and thrown out of the skin, and suspend it with a blunt hook.
And then make another incision after that incision by three fingers, and then flay the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
And then elevate it and cut it in the last incision towards the heel, and then extract it and elevate it until it has come out through the second incision, and then extract it from the incision that is above that.
And do this until you extract it from the incision that is highest or uppermost of all the incisions, until it is all out; and then cut it.
And if it does not obey you to extract and elevate, then insert a needle with strong double thread and tie it and extract it, or insert the probe under it and turn your hand in all directions until it is thrown out. And be careful that it is not cut; for if it is broken, it becomes very difficult for you to elevate it and harm has come upon the patient because of it.
And when you have thrown it all out, then place over the site of the wound wool soaked in wine and rose oil and non-rose oil, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is contracted having tortuosity to which there is convolution to the parts, and is not straight as we have said, then it is appropriate that you split it over all parts of its tortuosity and at the places of its convolution, and then suspend it with hooks until you elevate all of it.
And be careful in your incision that you do not cut the vein and that you do not wound it, for it will be difficult for you to elevate it; and maintain your prudence in this.
Form of the cutting instrument with which the vein is cut:
It does not have sharpness like the hooks nor is it of sharp extremity so that it does not wound the vein; and it is of thick flexibility, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein by its thinness; rather it has excessive thickness as we have said.
On extracting a vein from the leg.
This vein is formed in the legs in hot lands such as in Ategi in the land of the Arabs and in the hot and arid lands of India with little tenderness and where no grass or trees grow.
And it is easily formed in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its gestation is from putrefaction that comes under the skin just as serpents and worms and mites and worms are generated inside the body between the skin and the flesh.
And a sign of the onset of its coming is that this vein causes severe inflammation in the leg; and then the area becomes blistered; and then the vein begins to emerge from the site of that blister almost like the root of a plant.
And then when its extremity appears, it is fitting that you wrap over it a piece of lead weighing from one to two drachms, and tie it and leave the lead suspended from the leg.
And as many times as something of it comes out to the outer parts, wrap it in lead and tie it. And if it is much prolonged, then you cut a part of it and wrap the remainder; and do not cut it from the root until it has come out completely, because if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh and causes an abscess and rotting in the place and bad ulceration.
Therefore it is fitting that it be treated gently and be extracted little by little, until the last of it is thrown out and nothing of it remains in the body.
And from this vein has come out in some men that which is in its length of 5 palms and ten, and it has even come to me that one came out of 20 palms.
And if it is cut at the time of its medication, then introduce the probe into its hole and perforate it with a long hole with the body, until all that is in the matter is evacuated, and administer putrefaction of the place for some days with medicines; and afterwards cure it by the cure of abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, and especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and many orifices come to it, and a branch has come out of each orifice.
And then cure it as we have said in the division and with what is said above.
On cutting over worms generated under the skin and called bovine disease.
This disease is named in some land near us bovine disease because it often happens to cattle and it is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh, and it goes throughout the whole body rising and descending, and it is shown to the senses by its movement from member to member until it breaks the skin and comes out.
And its generation is by putrefaction of some humors just as worms and serpents and roundworms and mites happen in the belly.
And it is feared for its malice, because when it goes in the body and is elevated to the head, and has reached the eye, then it very easily opens into it and enters and destroys the eye, and this happens many times.
And so when you want to cure it and extract it, then it is not done except towards its movement and appearance to the senses, and then it is fitting that you tighten what is above it and what is below it with a binding and strong constriction, and afterwards cut over it and extract it.
And if it is deep in the flesh and you do not find it, then you place a cautery with fire over the place until it dies, and the main thing that is feared is its corruption with which it corrupts the place as we have said.
But if you see that it has reached the head near the eye, then tighten over the eyebrow with strong constriction, and afterwards cut over it, and extract it; and it is fitting that the patient use cleansing of his body with medicines evacuating putrid bad humors, and guard himself from foods generating putrefaction.
On the treatment of the illness called nafir.
This illness is called nafir in our land, and it is a pain which comes in some body parts, and then moves from one part to another.
And I have seen it as I will tell you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and uncovered her arm and saw a small swelling in the main vein of the arm, and after an hour, I saw that swelling move like a worm climbing up it, but more lightly than can be, as if it were quicksilver running from place to place.
And then the pain left that place and settled in the muscle, and stayed there for an hour.
And then it ran through the other body until it reached the other arm.
And then she told me that it moved all over her body as I saw; and I was very amazed at its movement and the speed from one part to another. And I had seen this before with my own eyes in this manner, however I have seen many who find pain moving from one part to another. But I did not see it with my eyes as I did in this woman.
And I do not think this is except because the woman was old, where there are dry bodies and exposed veins, and in her this moving wind appeared to the senses.
And it is necessary that this does not appear according to this backward-running in those who are delicate and with moist bodies of hidden veins.
And when you want to cure it, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to your eye as we have said, then you press on it and below it lightly and dry it until that constrained wind has come out, and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then you cure it with shaking of the body and with that which expels winds, and treat those with fetid pills and with pills of serapium and similar things.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diverse according to their types, and according to the places of the body where they fall, for their diversity is that some have large points, and small, and hollow, and solid ones; and some that have three angles, and some that have barbs; and some that have splinters.
And of the signs of the brain is when an arrow falls in it, and passes through the bone, and has come out of the membrane which is over the brain, for it causes by it violent headache, and dizziness, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasm and confusion of understanding and vomiting of bile, and very easily the speech is cut off and the voice is destroyed, and white moisture like dust comes out of the place of the wound, and something like watery flesh comes out of it.
And so if these signs appear to you, then you abstain from the cure and from the extraction of the arrow, if it is not outside.
But the signs of the arrow when it falls in the heart, are that it is near the left breast, and one feels as if it is fixed in a hard thing, and it is not an empty thing; and very soon the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood runs from the wound, and that follows coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting; and then know that death descends without any doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has wounded the lung are the exit of foamy blood from the wound, and the vessels that are near the neck are swollen, and the color of the patient is changed, and he exhales great high spirit, and demands attraction of cold air.
And if the arrow falls in the membrane which is in the chest, and the pain then is near the small ribs, and the breath is made great with vehement pain and with sigh, and not all the members of the muscles are moved.
And if the arrow falls in the stomach, then very soon some undigested food comes out of the wound.
And if the arrow falls in the belly, and is fixed in it, some crack comes out of the wound, or the skin, or bowel which is broken, and there is no hope in the cure of extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow falls in the bladder, and urine has come out, and some thing proceeds from it to the outer parts, and very soon there is pain over the patient, then know that it is mortal.
But the other members such as the face, the neck, and the throat, and the shoulders and the upper arm, and the vertebrae of the back, and the collarbone, and the thigh, and the leg and their similar members, are saved according to the major dispositions when the arrow does not find vein or artery and is not a poisonous arrow.
And I will recount to you what I have seen of the being of these arrows, so that you signify by this about your cure.
Which thing is, that in a man an arrow fell in the tear duct of his eye in the root of the nose, and I extracted it from him from the other part, below the fat of his ear, and he is healed, and no harm occurred in his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew which fell in him in the fat of his eye, below the lower eyelid, and the arrow was already hidden and nothing was achieved of it except a small extremity with which it adheres to its shaft, and it was a great arrow of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with lion iron in which there were no ears.
And the Jew is healed, and no bad accident occurred in his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man which had fallen in the throat, and it was an Arabic arrow, and it is that to which there are ears; and then I cut over it between two guides, and it was already submerged in his throat; and then I was subtle with it, and afterwards extracted it, and the Christian is healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen in his belly, and I thought that he would die from it; and then, after thirty days had passed and nothing had changed over him of his dispositions, I cut over the arrow and contrived over it, and he is healed, and no bad accident occurred to him.
And I saw more a man in whom an arrow fell in his back, and the wound is consolidated over him, and after it was seven years later, the arrow came out in the root of the thigh.
And I saw a woman to whom an arrow fell in her belly, and the wound is consolidated inside her, and nothing is changed in her dispositions at all, and the woman found no harm in any of her natural operations.
And I saw another man to whom an arrow fell in his face and the wound is consolidated and the arrow remained, not finding much pain there, and many similar to these.
And I extracted the arrow from the man of the princes of the king that had fallen in the middle place of his nose and had already declined to the right side a little, and the whole arrow was hidden.
And I was called to treat him after the arrow's fall for up to three days.
And then I found the arrow wound very narrow; and then I probed it with a subtle probe, and did not feel it; but he felt a prick below the right ear, and then I hoped that this prick was from the tip of the arrow.
And I applied a plaster to the place with a plaster in which there is attractive and digestive virtue, trusting that the place would become inflamed so that the location of the arrow would appear to me, so that I could cut above it.
And no accident occurred in the place indicating that the arrow had reached that place; and I continued with the plaster on him for many days and no accident occurred; and the wound healed meanwhile, and the patient remained without the extraction of it for the space of many days until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and reported this to me.
And then I applied a sharp corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it was opened, and with the probe I tested it, and found the subtle tip of the arrow, which adhered to the shaft.
And afterwards I enlarged the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine until the tip of the arrow appeared visibly to me, and time passed with this for the space of time up to four months.
And after the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert the forceps into it, and remove it, and it did not yield to exit, then I did not cease to refine and devise upon it with ingenious ways, until I began one day upon it with ways of devices to take it with properly made forceps, according to the form of those that will come at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it; and afterwards I restored that wound.
And some doctors judged that the cartilage of the nose is not restored, and I restored it and the wound is healed, and the patient is healed with complete health, and it did not harm him in any way.
And I recount to you the quality of extraction of some arrows so that you may set this as a rule and indication about what I have not said, for the parts of this art and its definitions are not comprehended with narration nor does the book comprehend them.
And the wise craftsman compares with little over much; and with what is present over what is absent; and finds new operation and new instrument towards the descent of strange causes of the art when they occur.
And so I say that arrows are not cast out of the members in which they are fixed except according to two ways: either by attraction of the place in which it entered; or by the contrary of the other part.
And that which is cast by the place where it entered, either is an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place, and is drawn and cast out.
And if it does not yield to exit at the time in which it falls, then it is fitting that you leave it for some days until the flesh that is around it rots, and its attraction and its egress is eased.
And similarly if it is fixed in bone and does not yield to you to exit, then leave it for some days and repeat that with attraction and motion each day, and it is already cast out.
And if it does not yield to you exit after some days, then it is fitting that you perforate in the circuit of the arrow in that bone from every part with a subtle auger until the place of the arrow is enlarged, and afterwards extract it.
But if the arrow is already hidden in the body, and is hidden from sensation, then you should probe for it with a probe, and if you feel it, then pull it out with some instruments which are suitable for its extraction.
And if you cannot reach it due to the constriction of the wound and the depth of penetration, and there is no bone or nerve or vein there, then you should cut open the wound until it is widened and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
And if it has barbs with which it is held, then you should free the flesh in which it is lodged from all sides with all the skill you can muster; and if you cannot manage the removal of the flesh, attempt to break or twist the barbs until it yields.
And when you administer the extraction of the arrow in whatever place it may be, then you should use a twisting motion of your hand with forceps on all sides until you make it yield; and be extremely careful that the arrow is not broken and that its extraction does not become difficult for you.
And if you cannot manage it at that time, then you should leave it for a few days until the parts around it begin to rot, and then try again for then it is loosened. But if you are faced with the problem of blood flow, then you should administer what we have said about treatment in its chapter.
And guard your skill from cutting a vein or nerve, or cord, and use all possible means to remove the arrow; and do this with ease and tranquility and slowness and firmness as I have described to you.
And therefore make the arrow retract so that the patient is in the same position as when the arrow fell into him, for this is more helpful. But if this is not possible for you, then you should do what is possible for you according to the circumstances.
But for arrows that are ejected from the opposite side, or from which some part already protrudes to the outside, or if the tip of the arrow causes a bump that can be felt just under the nearby skin and you see it protruding; then you should cut above it; and let the cut be according to the size that the forceps can grasp; and then pull it out, for it is made easy to remove.
But if it is retained in the bone, then you should twist the blade in the opposite direction until the arrow makes an impression in the bone, and widens itself, and then extract it.
If not, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow is still attached, then you should push it out with it.
But if the shaft has fallen off and you want to push it out, then you should insert into it, if it is solid, a hollow instrument so that its cavity enters the tail of the arrow and then push it out with it.
But if the arrow is hollow, then you push it with a strong instrument entering into it, because the arrow is lightened by it.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you hollow out all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you to do so, and afterward cure it with what is appropriate.
And if the arrow falls in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side, and is close so that you touch it with the probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it, then cut above it and be careful of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it, and afterward sew the wound if needed, and cure it until it is healed.
Form of forceps with which arrows are drawn:
Let their extremities be like a bird’s beak that are made like a saw when they grip the arrow so that they don't let it go.
And of these are made many types, large, small and medium, according to the quantity of the size of the arrow and its smallness, and the width of the wound, and the constriction of it.
like a ray so that the entry of it into the hollow arrow is lightened and it is pushed with that.
On bloodletting of the veins.
The veins for bloodletting from which it is customary to draw blood are 30, of which 16 are in the head, that is two pulsating veins which are near the ears, called alhasisain; two herbs that are in the two visible temples; and two veins that are in two tear ducts of two eyes that are called looking; and the vein prepared in the middle of the forehead, and the vein that is at the tip of the nose; and two guidegi that are on the neck; and two veins that are in the upper lip; and two veins that are in the lower lip; and — these are the veins that are called algelic —; and there are two veins that are under the tongue. But the veins that are bled in the arms are 5; for of these one is cephalic, and is towards the wild side; and the people call it "the vein of the head", and muffled, and it is the middle vein, and is composed of a branch of the basilic, and of another branch of the cephalic; and the people name it "vein of all the body", and basilic is a vein which is placed on the domestic side, and is named "citillar", and the common people name it "vein of the belly"; and funis of the arm, and it is placed on the forearm, and it is that in which is bled, and it is that which appears on the wrist by manifest appearance; and salvatella, and it is the vein that is between the ring finger and the smallest finger, and there are two branches in it.
And in the foot and the leg there are three veins; one of these is that which is below the curve of the knee on the wild side; and the second is sophena, and its place is below the leg on the domestic side; and the sciatic vein, and its place is below the leg on the wild side; and in the leg are other veins similar to these.
The benefit of the veins that are near the ears is for ancient catarrhs and migraine and sahafati and bad ancient ulcerations of the head.
And the quality of bleeding those is as I tell you: the patient's head should be shaved, and the patient's head should be rubbed at the occiput in the place of both veins with a wide cloth with good friction; afterwards, the patient should tighten their neck with a band until both appear and their places are after the ears in two depressed places of the head; and seek that with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those with your finger, mark there with ink.
Afterwards, take the knife-like lance, which is the cutting one, and then insert it under the vein in the skin until the lancet reaches the bone. And then raise your hand with the vein and the skin to the upper parts and cut the vein with an incising cut. And let the length of the incision be the quantity of two joined fingers or thereabouts; and let out as much blood as you want.
And afterwards, tighten with compresses and leave it until it is healed.
And I have already preceded in the beginning of the book the incision of those and their cauterization.
But of the two arterial veins that are at the temples, the benefit of bloodletting is for ancient migraine and sudden evil and persistent eye inflammation and flow of acute superfluities poured into the eyes.
And the quality of bleeding those is as I tell you: let the patient tighten their neck very much until the two veins appear to the touch by clear appearance and let their pulse be demonstrated under your finger; and then you mark with ink.
And afterwards, you raise the skin above the vein to the upper parts with your index finger, and insert the cutting lancet underneath, and raise the vein upwards; and cut it as you have done in the other two veins; and let the blood run according to the quantity of your need.
And afterwards, untie the patient's constriction, and place your finger over the vein for an hour, and afterwards place cotton and compresses on it and tighten it above with strong constriction, and leave it until it is healed.
And the remembrance of them has already preceded, and of those the incision, and the attraction at the beginning of the book.
And so the benefit of bloodletting from the vein of the forehead is after the bloodletting of the cephalic for ancient diseases of the face and for migraine and redness and fetid ulcerations.
And the quality of the bloodletting of it is as I tell you; that is, that the patient tightens their neck with a band until the vein appears; and afterwards take the instrument which is called a fossori of which this is its form:
Place the prominent point which is at the head of the fossori on that vein and strike it with a comb or with another thing in its manner, and let the blood run according to the quantity which you want; and afterwards untie the patient's perforation and tighten it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide lancet, however it is not suitable that the lancet be of sharp extremity as the other lancets, rather it should be of wide extremity, and bleed it according to the transverse, because the bone is near and the lancet would very easily break in it when it is thin.
But the benefit of the two veins that are at the tear ducts of both eyes is for scabies of the eyes, for redness and onion in the eyes, and for diseases of the face.
And the quality of the bloodletting is that the patient tightens their neck with a band, and afterwards bleed those, and you should be standing over their head.
And let the bloodletting be done according to the transverse to a little length with a small lancet, because in the place there is no flesh; and if the lancet is thin, its extremity is very easily broken.
And afterwards let the blood run as much as is necessary for you, and place cotton on those, and tighten those for one night, and afterwards untie those.
But the bloodletting from the vein of the nose is beneficial for acute fever and severe headache, and for diseases of the face and migraine and redness that occurs in the face, and especially when it is chronic.
And the method of bloodletting from it is that the patient tightens his neck and then you hold his nose with your left hand, and take the long, thin lancet and insert it in the middle of the tip of the nose in a straight line, for the vein does not appear to the touch there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
It is necessary that you guide your hand with the lancet little by little and make the blood flow according to your need; and afterwards bind it for a night, for it is easily restored.
But the benefit of bloodletting from the two guidegui [possibly jugular veins] is for constriction of breath and for the beginning of leprosy and for many diseases and impetigo and bad corrosive ulcerations such as herpotromeno [possibly herpes].
And the method of bloodletting from these is that the patient tightens below each one on his neck with a binding; and the practitioner stands over the head of the patient, and the patient is sitting on a chair.
And then bleed the vein lengthwise with a wide lancet little by little; and then extract blood according to a moderate quantity or according to what you see is necessary for this; and then do the same for the other vein.
And then untie the binding and tighten the two veins with moderate pressure so that the patient is not suffocated, and leave until morning for the wound is healed.
And the benefit of bloodletting from the algerich veins [possibly sublingual veins] is beneficial for small abscesses and pustules of the mouth and corruption of the gums and bad ulcerations and fissures, and for bad ulcerations that are in the nose and in its surroundings.
And the method of bloodletting from these is that you make the patient sit before you, and tighten his neck with a band, and then roll back his lips and look at two veins of which one is on the right of the lip and the second on the left; and the indication of each is by the blackness of each of both, and it is more so because in their surroundings are small black veins; and then incise each with an incising incision.
But if there is doubt under you, and you don't know which of these it is, then you intend to incise the larger of these, and the more visible of these.
And do the same for the two veins that are in the upper lips.
But of two veins that are under the tongue, the benefit is after the bloodletting of the cephalic for suffocations that are in the throat, for the disease of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth.
And the method of bloodletting these is that the patient follows between your hands before the sun, and elevate his tongue, and look under the tongue, on one side of it a vein and on the other side a vein, and the color of each is tending to blackness.
And then bleed each; and be careful that you don't extend your hand in bleeding these, for under these are arteries.
And your veins that are bled in the elbow are those in which custom runs in all men, and their bloodletting is done according to two ways, either puncturing with the myrtle-shaped or olive-shaped lancet tending to subtlety; or cutting with a knife-like lancet, and it is called alnessil, and this is its form:
let its side be as you see, and it is suitable to open the hollow full veins proceeding apparent thick, and for those that contain thick turbid blood.
And this lancet is of lesser width and of more subtle extremity, and is suitable for bloodletting of subtle veins that contain thin citrine blood.
But the benefit of bloodletting from the basilic vein which is one of three veins: for it extracts the blood from the diseases that are below the throat and neck, and from what follows the chest and the belly.
And it is advised for the phlebotomist, when performing phlebotomy on it, to watch it carefully and be very cautious with it, because below it there is an artery, and if he errs and hits it with the puncture of the lancet, he will cut that artery and cause a flow of blood, so it is better not to perform phlebotomy on it with a puncturing lancet, but rather with a cutting one like an alnessil.
And if the basilic vein does not appear clearly visible, then it is better that you leave it and move to the other one, or that you look for one of its branches; or that you perform phlebotomy at the end of the arm, because that one is visible; and cut it with an alnessil lancet as we have said.
But if you want to perform phlebotomy on the same one, then it is necessary before tightening the arm to touch the area until you recognize the location of the pulse, and then mark it with ink; and after that tie the arm and cut the vein with a concave cut using an alnessil lancet as we have said; and be careful that the puncture falls some distance from the location of the artery.
And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, a swelling in the place that you have marked with ink, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery, and therefore avoid it.
And if you see the blood flowing in the phlebotomy like the urine of a child, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is blood from the artery; and then hurry and place your finger over it for a long time; and after removing your finger, if the blood has stopped, because many times it stops, then you tighten the arm and leave it.
And guard the patient from moving it, and be very cautious with it and do not move it for some days until it is healed.
But if the blood does not stop, and you see that you do not have medicine present for this, then you cut the artery, if it appears to you; because its extremity is contracted, and the blood is stopped; or take bark of pistachio, and split it, and take one half and tighten it over the location of the vein with a descending tightness with a bandage and with compresses until the next day.
And then if the blood has stopped, it is good; and if not, then treat it with that which has been mentioned before in the section on powders that stop the flow of blood.
And the stopping of blood from it is difficult in many situations because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of tying the arm.
But for the dark vein, the phlebotomy is beneficial as it extracts blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, as we have said.
And it is necessary for the one performing phlebotomy on it to be very cautious in the phlebotomy of it, because below it there is a nerve; and if he hits it with the puncture of the lancet and finds the nerve, it will cause numbness, and its healing is difficult, and very often it is not healed completely, And this nerve many times appears to the touch; and if it is hidden to some men and is subtle and not shown, then it is necessary that you place the lancet with which you perform phlebotomy with an alnessil cut, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you split the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and is beneficial for diseases of the eyes.
And it is necessary in this specifically, if you want to perform phlebotomy by puncturing with an olive-shaped lancet or with a myrtle-shaped lancet; because it is the safest of all the veins, as there is no artery or nerve below it.
However, it is very easily infected in some men, when it is not bled in the first strike, but that infection does not harm anything.
The first of them is that you should know that bleeding is not administered except for the preservation of health and for the hope of it and caution of the occurrence of diseases, and that bleeding should be done in one of the veins that are in the elbow, that is: cephalic, fuscous and basilic; and that bleeding should be done at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter after eating, when signs of repletion appear.
And bleeding should be done on the third day or on the first after three hours have passed from the day.
But bleeding that is administered, but when it provokes convenience and necessity for this, either by night or by day, at all hours and at all times.
And it is appropriate that a child should not be bled until he is 14 years old, and a woman who is pregnant should not be bled except from the fourth month until the seventh, and the old should not be bled who have already passed 60 years.
And when someone wants to be bled in whatever manner, it is appropriate that he clean his bowels before the bleeding with a gentle enema, if there is much retained waste in them, so that the veins do not draw the superfluities in the bleeding from the bowels, which are putrid, and that they do not harm the principal members.
And patients with nausea and indigestion should not be bled, nor those recovering from illness or drunkenness until that is removed from them, nor those sick with dropsy, and moreover bleeding should be feared after colic passion and after vomiting, and after bowel movement, and after multiplication of coitus and of work and of exercise of fasting or of vigils and of any cause that dissolves the virtue, whether it be corporal or animal.
And afterwards consider in the thinning of humors before this if the blood is thick, with foods and drinks, and with medicines if this is possible for him to do.
And afterwards enter into a bath if nothing prohibits it, or be exercised by some exercise so that the blood may be thinned.
And place his bleeding in the best part of the day, that is around the hour of terce, as we have said.
And strive that his chest be guarded on that day from all evil animal accidents, such as anguish, anger, fear, and from all corporal accidents, such as excessive work and pain and coitus and similar to them.
And at his session let there be present the things in the use of which runs the custom of men with aromaticity and odor and with balsams and similar to those according to the quantity of possibility.
And let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one who is to be bled.
And afterwards let him extend his arm, and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand two or three times; and afterwards tighten the binding with a strap and wrap it twice.
And let the tightness be tempered, for when the tightness is not equal, or the tightness is with superfluity, then it prohibits the flow of blood; or it is with softening, and then it prohibits the course of blood likewise.
And after the tightening, it is appropriate that the one who is to be bled rub his hands together between them until the veins are swollen, and are declared to the feeling.
And afterwards let the phlebotomist anoint his lancet with a little old oil properly; and afterwards place his index finger of the left hand on that vein, below the place from which he wants the bleeding, so that the vein may flee a little, and the percussion may be ceased for of the veins is that which you find thus as a cord fleeing towards the bleeding, and of those it is that is full of windiness and when you place the lancet on that it is contracted towards the lancet, and the phlebotomist is deceived; and the lancet does not open the vein, and if it opens, that is narrow.
And so, for this reason it is appropriate that the phlebotomist be steady and be careful in all these things.
And after that, perform the phlebotomy, but if the vein is opened in one go, then it is good; and if not, you repeat this again a little below that place, or above it with haste, if the place is not swollen.
And if the place is swollen, or the patient is frightened, then you leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, because it will quickly attract hot swelling, nor should he enter a bath.
And afterwards repeat the phlebotomy if it is necessary.
And if the opening is small and blood flows thinly, and you fear that the amount of blood you want will not come out, then you repeat the phlebotomy in that hole in the same direction and enlarge the opening a little, and do this quickly before the place becomes swollen, because the place becomes swollen in many men from a small opening.
But if you see it already swollen, then do not repeat it there, because nothing excuses you; and put on it some part of the oil compress, because it eases the flow of blood. And it is better in this place than oil and other oils.
And similarly administer an oil compress in every phlebotomy with which you bleed the veins to stop the flow of blood, and they do this with theriac alfadoc and sagzenea when one of these is placed on the spot, because the blood is thinned and is revolved when it is thick.
And if in the place of the phlebotomy a large swelling is formed, because it often happens, and especially to one who has not been bled except that time, or in the small opening of the vein, and then you hurry, and put on the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, a little heated, and tighten it for an hour, because it is dissolved.
And it is appropriate to do this after the blood comes out of that vein completely or from another vein.
And if some blackness or greenness remains in the place for some days, it does not harm; and if you want, put on it something of aloe and myrrh dissolved, or something of the juice of wild mint or calamint or similar to it.
And often swellings and protrusions occur from phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
And so put your hand on it, and if then you find softness from your compression on it, then that protrusion is malignant and bad; and then be careful that you put on it any of what we have said, because blood will flow very quickly from the artery.
And make a plaster with something that has astringency, so that the place becomes hardened, and afterwards treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
And it is appropriate that you extract blood from every man according to the quantity of his strength and according to the color prevailing in the blood as it appears.
Because if the blood is black, then you let it come out until it is red; and similarly if you see it thick, then you let it come out until it is thinned; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is appropriate for one who is full and strong and needs blood extraction in one go, that the phlebotomy of the vein be enlarged and the phlebotomist be wide.
And in one who is weak, the opposite of that should be done, and it is appropriate that he extract that in many times, and that the hole be narrow.
And the best that is administered in phlebotomy of a vein is that the cut be transverse, not a puncture.
And this manner of phlebotomy is safe from blood flow and nerve incision, and is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy according to width and length.
And for the one who is accustomed to fainting from phlebotomy, it is appropriate that you treat him before the phlebotomy with a little bread soaked in pomegranate wine or simple oxymel heated; and extract blood from him in three or four times.
And if there is a coldness of complexion, then take before the bloodletting bread soaked in myrrh syrup or in honey syrup flavored with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger and similar, or in aromatic and very fragrant syrup.
And if fainting occurs during the bloodletting, and it is caused by too much blood loss, then it is advisable to drink meat broth and very fragrant, subtle syrup; and use aromatics with algalia, and anoint his chest with it.
And use the other things that we have mentioned in the division in the chapter on fainting due to evacuation.
And who wants to ventilate his arm and dissolve his blood a second time, it is advisable for him whose bloodletting is for much evacuation, and whose strength is weak, to evacuate the blood little by little, that is according to the quantity of strength in the continuous days.
But who wants to ventilate his arm, and remove his blood a second time, and his body is strong, then do this after 7 or 9 hours from the first bloodletting.
But who wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite of the part to which it inclines, it is advisable that it be ventilated on the second or third day.
But that body in which there is much blood already heated and is acute and causes fever to occur, it is advisable that blood be removed from it in one go and a large quantity be removed from it and the opening be widened until fainting occurs, after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting; and that you place your hand on his pulse towards the body of blood, so that death does not occur instead of fainting, for this often happens when the bloodletter is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not advisable when you want to untie the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, when the orifice of the vein is already closed and the exit of blood has become difficult, that you press on it with vehemence and bend it to be extended lightly, for this is very bad.
Rather, leave it until it is bled secondarily; or remove that with the sharpness of the lancet that is coagulated from the blood in the orifice of the vein; or place on it some theriac alfarach, or sagzenea, and compress it with light compression until the blood has come out.
And if the vein is swollen, then leave it and do not touch it until the swelling has subsided.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate the blood secondarily, and there is no excuse, then you bleed him above that place or in the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "rope of the arm" is bled in place of the dark one or the basilic, when they are not found or are hidden, for it is composed of those.
And the quality of its bloodletting is that the patient puts his hand in hot water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears clearly.
And afterwards it should be tightened above it with a binding with medium stricture; and afterwards bleed according to the small transverse, not latitudinally nor according to the length.
And let the opening be wide and let your bloodletting with which you bleed it be above the joint of the hand a little.
And if the flow of blood is prohibited, then you repeat the hand in the hot water and let the blood run in the water until you achieve your necessity.
But if you were in the summer days, then you are excused from the repetition of the hand in hot water, and the month is set the course of blood in hot water in winter time.
And the bloodletting of this vein is safer than all the other veins, for below it there is no pulsatile vein, nor nerve.
And the bloodletting of the cephalic vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
And the quality of its bloodletting is that you tighten the hand with a binding or with your hand, after you have put it in hot water, until the vein is swollen and is well demonstrated to sight; and afterwards bleed it transversely; and if you cut it completely it will not harm anything.
And be careful not to open your hand with the phlebotomy, because below it are the nerves of the fingers exposed without flesh.
And afterwards put the hand in warm water and let the blood flow into it, because if you don't put it in warm water, the blood will coagulate in the orifice of the vein, and the flow is blocked.
And when the blood is extracted according to the necessary quantity, then you put oil and salt on the vein, so that it doesn't heal too quickly; and similarly you should do this for any narrow branch.
But the benefit of phlebotomy on the left hand is that it is helpful for diseases of the spleen.
And do similarly in the phlebotomy of it as you have done in the other.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, and for retention of menses, and for diseases of the kidneys and old ulcers of the thighs and legs, and for similar diseases.
And the method of phlebotomy of it is that the patient puts his foot in warm water and rubs it until the veins appear well; and tie above the joint of the foot with a strap; and the place of the vein is the apparent heel towards the thumb, and from it are branched many branches on the face of the foot.
Therefore, perform phlebotomy on the widest branch or below the leg towards the heel towards its aggregation, because it is better and safer.
And if you perform phlebotomy on it on the face of the foot, then be careful of the nerves that are below it on the face of the foot, and place your phlebotomy with which you perform phlebotomy across, as if you wanted to cut it.
And let the phlebotomy be careful.
But if the blood flow is blocked; then you put his foot back in the warm water and let the blood run into it until it is evacuated.
And if the person performing phlebotomy errs on the first try, then repeat with the phlebotomy a little higher up, because the place is safe; and don't fear harming it, but be careful of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly do the same for the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
And for the sciatic vein, the place as we have said is towards the heel below the ankle on the outer side.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of it is for hip pain when it is due to hot blood.
And the method of phlebotomy of it is that the patient enters a bath, and hurries and tightens his thigh on the side of the hip down to above the heel above four fingers with a long thin bandage, because it doesn't appear except by this.
And so when it appears, then you perform phlebotomy on it according to each method that is possible for you and across, and it is better; or cut it by incision or section it by section, because its location is safe.
And it is very hidden in many men; and if you find it, and it doesn't appear to the touch at all, then perform phlebotomy on some branch of it, and it is the one that appears on the back of the foot towards the little finger and the ring finger.
And be careful of the nerves, and let the quantity of blood you want flow.
And afterwards untie the stricture and place cotton on the site of the phlebotomy and tighten the place, because it heals easily.
On ventilation and the qualities of using them.
Ventouses are made of horns, or brass, or glass.
And ventilation is done in two ways: one of them is with scarification and extraction of blood, and the other is ventilation without scarification.
And this ventilation without scarification is done in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And for the ventouses that are administered with scarification and extraction of blood, there are fourteen places on the body, of which one where ventouses are placed is the occiput, and it is the back part of the head; and the middle place of it on both sides of the neck together; and ventouses of the chin below the jaw lower than the mouth; and ventouses of two shoulder blades; and ventouses of the coccyx, which is above the end of the tail; and ventouses of two forearms, which are of two arms; and ventouses of two ankles; and ventouses of two thighs.
And ventilation does not extract blood except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and for this reason virtue does not fall through them, as it does through phlebotomy; nor should ventilation be done with fire or without fire in any illness caused by repletion until the whole body is evacuated.
But if necessity calls for ventilation due to illness or continuity, we administer it at any time at the beginning of the month and at the end of it, and in the middle of it and at whatever time it may be.
And so when you see any of these things, and especially if it is in the third or middle of the month, then we command ventilation to be done after two or three hours of the day have passed.
And the benefit of ventilation of the nape is that when it helps with heaviness in the head and with what is poured into the eyes; but it should be done after evacuation of the whole body.
And this ventouse is in place of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
And it is not allowed to use it on one who is of cold complexion, or in whom there is catarrh, for it gives them great harm.
And for this reason it is not suitable for the elderly to use it, and in those whose heads have cold illnesses.
But for one who continues it over time, forgetfulness is caused; and for this reason you should command the ventilator to place his hand a little with the ventouse to the lower parts, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
But ventilation of the back is in place of phlebotomy of the dark vein and the basilic vein: and for this reason it helps with asthma, and with constriction of breath and with tearing of the breathing instrument, and with cough, and with repletion.
And the ventouse should be pushed a little on the back, for if it is placed below, it generates weakness in the body and in the stomach.
And the ventilation of the temples helps with pains occurring in the head and with eye inflammation, and migraine, and suffocation, and with pains in the roots of the teeth; and it is in place of phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
It is advisable to instruct the cupper not to press his hand with scarification so as not to cut the artery and cause blood flow.
And cupping below the chin helps with throat ailments in the mouth, and with corruption of the gums, and similar diseases that are in the mouth, and stands in place of phlebotomy of the lips that are in the two lips.
But the cupping that is done on the two shoulders helps with headaches, which is caused by excess heat.
And the cupping of the two inner parts of the arms helps in place of phlebotomy of three veins, that is the basilic, median, and cephalic, because it draws blood from all those smaller veins that are in the flesh, and those small veins from the other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
And instruct the cupper not to proceed too much with scarification, because the place is devoid of flesh, and below it are nerves and arteries.
And there is a cup with which one cups over the bones and it helps with hemorrhoids of the anus and ulcerations below.
And it is advisable that you instruct the cupper to use a large cup, and that it be made of copper, because the place needs strong suction; and very light cups are easily pierced and should be scarified with scarification.
But cups on the legs reduce by manifest reduction, because they draw blood from the whole body, and help with old pains of the kidneys and of the womb, and of the bladder; and provoke menstruation, and help with boils and swellings; and stand in place of phlebotomy of two saphenous veins, and the sciatic nerve, and of two ankles.
However, they greatly weaken the whole body and cause fainting in many men.
And of the cups on the sciatic nerve, the benefit is close to the benefit of the cups on the two legs.
And the quality of the positioning of the cups is that you place the cup at the beginning empty and suck with moderate suction, and do not prolong the positioning of the cups, but place them lightly, and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the place by equal arrival. And do not cease to repeat this and continue until you see the place already reddening and swelling and the redness of the blood appears.
And then you scarify and repeat the suction little by little, and afterwards consider the disposition of the body.
For that man who is of tender flesh with rare pores, it is advisable that you scarify him once and no more, so that the place is not ulcerated.
And instruct the cupper to amplify the scarification and deepen a little, and temper the suction with ease.
And if in the blood there is thickness, then it is advisable to scarify twice, because in the first time the way of subtlety to the blood and its wateriness is opened. But in the second to the acquired scrutiny of the extraction of thick blood.
And if the blood is very feculent, then scarification should be done a third time to achieve the last.
And lastly, when we want to extract the blood little by little or a small amount, one scarification is enough for us.
And if we want extraction of much blood, we scarify with much scarification; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is advisable that we scarify with deep scarification.
And the term of scarification in which is the depth of the skin only.
And if the one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are narrow, it is advisable that the places of the cups be anointed with lenitive, aperient, resolvent ointments; if it is in summer time, such as aloe oil or violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil; and if it is in winter time, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or blood oil, and those similar to them.
And if the superfluity is thick, cold, then the oil should be amaranth, or costmary oil, or aloe oil, or dill oil, and similar to them.
But if the cupping area has wide pores of tender flesh, then it should be prohibited from oil, and it is necessary that for this the cupping sites be washed with rosewater or with cold water of nightshade, or with water of gourd, or with water of purslane, and similar to these.
And for the one whose blood has much humidity, wash their cupping sites with vinegar, or with water of myrtle and sumac and similar to those.
And for the one whose superfluities are thick, wash their cupping sites with old wine, or with water of marjoram, which is majorana, or with a decoction of dill, or of chamomile, and similar to those.
And it is necessary that the cupping be guarded before bathing; it is better that it be administered after leaving the bath for an hour or two, and it is necessary to sleep after the cupping.
What is it that one must govern the cupped or bled person before cupping.
It is necessary to consider at the beginning: then if the cupped one or the one who must be bled is choleric and wind overcomes the acute blood and inflammation, then it is necessary that they take cooling things, such as sour pomegranates, and endive with vinegar and lettuce, and secanabin, and julep, and similar to them.
And give them foods such as chickens, and meats of wild birds, and foods seasoned with verjuice, and similar to them.
And for the one whose complexion is cold, it is necessary that they drink syrup of almonds, or syrup of alsecanabin seeds, and sumac, and very fragrant wine between old and new; and that they be commanded to use little drink and food, and give them foods of chicken and hemp and fish and small birds and young pigeons.
And it is necessary that on the day of cupping and bleeding, the drink be more than the food.
And it is necessary that at certain times some men be given to drink theriac alpharac, or musk medicine, that is nutmeg, or alcelita before cupping or before bleeding or after, so that the principal members are comforted and the blood is thinned; and it is not necessary that they take this heated.
But the cups that are without scarification are cups that are placed on the liver, and on the spleen and gout, and on the navel, in the places of the knees, and the hip joint, for these members do not suffer scarification on themselves.
And it is not sought by these except the attraction of blood from a member, as we place a cup on the breast in illness of blood flux from the nostrils; and we use it to dissolve cold viscosity from the member, as we place on the belly and navel; for that rarefies the member and warms it and removes the pain because it resolves windiness.
And it has already been placed on the kidneys when obstruction or stone occurs in them, for by virtue of strong attraction it soon opens obstruction and eradicates the stone from its place.
And similarly it does when it is placed on the liver and spleen towards windiness enclosed in them.
And these cups are administered empty with suction only; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of lukewarm water in illnesses of the spleen.
And this is so that the cup may be filled and be larger, that is hot water alone or water in which herbs suitable for this have been cooked.
Form of cup administered with fire: let the width of the orifice be two fingers, according to how we have formed it; and the quantity of the depth be half a palm; and let there be on its side, in the place that is in the circuit, half of it, let the hole be small according to the quantity that enters in it a needle.
Let it be made of red or citrine copper, with thick margins, smooth, equal and polished so that it does not harm the member towards its position on it.
And there should be in the middle of it a transverse rod of copper or iron, where a candle with fire is placed.
And although this cupping glass is much larger than the one we have described; and the small one is smaller than that, according to the illnesses and the age of the one who uses it.
And the cupping glasses for children and the emaciated are different from those for young people and those with robust bodies.
And the method of placing this cupping glass with fire on the limb is to extend the wick with wood fire decently before a small wax candle, and place it on the middle of the transverse rod in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the fire is lit around the lower part so that the body of the patient is not burned.
And after it is placed on the limb of the patient, and the finger is on the hole we have mentioned, until when we hold the cupping glasses and we do not need to remove the finger and let the vapor escape through that hole, then the cupping glass will be quickly dissolved.
And then ignite the wick according to its manner, and repeat it if you need it.
But in a cupping glass that is administered in the illness of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse rod or hole, and is not administered unless it is filled with water, and is placed on the limb only.
And this is its shape: And this cupping glass, the larger it is, the better, so that it can receive a large quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not administered on many limbs except on those limbs where the placement of cupping glasses is not possible, due to their small size, such as the lip and gum and similar to them; or on a limb stripped of flesh, such as the finger and the nose and similar to them.
And the method of using them is that if you have found leeches that are in fresh waters clean of putrefaction.
And afterwards they should be left for a day and a night in fresh water until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their bellies; and afterwards the body should be evacuated at the beginning with phlebotomy and with cupping glasses; and afterwards rub the limb of the patient until it reddens; and afterwards they should be placed on it.
And when they are full and fall off.
And if suction of the place with a cupping glass is possible, it is more beneficial afterwards.
And if not, then wash the place with vinegar and afterwards with much water; and it should be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the flow of blood is prolonged after the falling of the leeches, and this is oozing, then you soak a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on top until the oozing is stopped.
And if the blood is multiplied, then sprinkle crushed vitriol on it, or galls and similar astringent substances, until the blood is stopped; or place halves of peeled beans on the place, and leave them until the beans adhere to the place, and the blood is stopped.
And it is appropriate, if necessary, to repeat the leeches, when it is possible to change them.
And if the leeches are prevented from attaching, then rub the place with fresh blood or prick a needle in the places until blood comes out; and afterwards place them, for when they feel any blood they quickly attach.
And when you want them to fall off, sprinkle a little crushed aloe on them, or salt, or ash, and they fall off immediately.
Here begins the prologue of the third part: on restoration. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine; it is about the restoration of fractures and dislocations occurring in bones.
Oh, son, know that foolish doctors and common people boast about this chapter, and those who have never looked at the books of the Ancients nor read a letter from them.
And for this reason, this manner of knowledge in our land is private; and I have not forgotten anything about it at any time; and I have not added what I learned, except through long reading of the books of the Ancients and study of their understanding, until I extracted their knowledge.
And afterwards I directed myself to experiment and study throughout my life.
And I have already described in this chapter all that my knowledge contains and on which my experiment has passed; since I had abbreviated it for you others and delivered it from the occupation of elongation; and I abbreviated it in the end of abbreviation; and I showed it in the end of declaration; and I formed in it many forms of instruments that are administered in it, as is done by addition of declaration, as I have done in two preceding chapters.
First Chapter.
Summaries and collections from the essence of bone fractures, from those whose introduction is necessary, before we begin the recollection of broken limbs and the different ones if of each one. It is appropriate then that we say in the preface of this chapter the summaries of the discourse; and the chapters to the understanding of which at the beginning the craftsman is forced and to station over the truth of those; that is you and those who are ready to know or learn this noble art from you.
And so I say that when someone suffers a fracture or dislocation or sprain or fall, then it is appropriate that you hasten at the beginning with bloodletting or to relieve him, or both together, if nothing prohibits it, such as weakness of virtue, or if the one to whom it happens is a child, or old in decrepitude, or it is a time of vehement heat, or of vehement cold.
And afterwards be content in his food with cold herbs and meats of birds and goats; and we prohibit fatty meats and filling oneself with foods and any food that fills the veins with blood, until you are assured against hot apostema, and if you do not fear effusion of matter to the limb.
And then let the patient return to his first regimen with which he usually runs.
And so when the broken bone begins to be restored, then it is appropriate that the patient be fed with nutritious foods of much and thick and heavy nourishment in which there is viscosity, such as foods made of wheat cooked with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and cow bellies, and eggs, and fresh fish, and thick wine and similar to those, and with this regimen the coagulation of the fracture is made more easily and better.
And know that broken bones when they are in men who are in the first old age and in the decrepit, it is not possible that they be continued and be consolidated according to their nature because of the drying out of their limbs.
But however, nature adds and connects over the broken bone from every part something similar to glue in which there is thickness that adheres and tightens it until they are together conglutinated and bound together, until they come to the end of strength and firmness, as it was at the beginning, until nothing prohibits it from its works.
And for this reason it is necessary that you set aside the foods of the sick, foods in which there is heaviness and viscosity and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, for a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the head bone; and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone; and similarly all the other limbs are different from each other.
And I come with remembrance of every type of fracture, explained in its distinct chapter from the others.
Many different types of fractures in themselves. And the types of bone fractures are diversified in themselves; for an arched fracture is made beyond what happens in the stars; and sometimes a fracture is made along the length of the bone: and these are fractures of splinters and chips and protrusions proceeding and not proceeding, as is done in the pen when it is prepared to write, and it is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head, and it is a small fissure fracture.
And for every type there is a proper device or treatment in restoration of them according to what will come to memory of them distinctly in their places.
Many signs of bone fracture. And by this a bone fracture is known: it is the tortuosity of it, and its prominence and appearance to the touch, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
And so when there is no apparent tortuosity in the place nor is sound made towards your touch when you touch the bone with agitation and the patient does not find great pain, then there is no fracture there.
Rather it is possible that there is tortuosity or a small fissure, then it is not appropriate that you move it with your hand and with compression of all; rather place on it the medicines of which remembrance comes after that moment which is suitable for the place; and afterwards let it be tightened by subtle tightening.
And know that when the place is arched and is not split in two or beyond what happens in splinters, when every part is removed from its companion, then it is appropriate that you begin from your hour to rectify it before a hot swelling occurs to it.
And if a hot swelling occurs to it, then leave it for some days until the swelling ceases; and afterwards straighten it according to each manner that you can with lightness and skill.
And know that its restoration and joining is easier than of the bone in which splinters occur.
And afterwards tighten it according to what will come to memory of it.
But if there are splinters in the bone, then extension of this broken limb is necessary from two parts, if it is the hand or the foot; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two ropes or with one rope and the hand.
And let your position with which you place the limb be an equal place according to its natural figure, while the parts of the broken limb are extended, then strive to make those protrusions return with skill and according to each manner that you can to their places.
And guard yourself according to your strength that pain or injury does not occur to the patient by your operation; and strive according to your power that you apply one bone with its companion according to their best forms.
And it is appropriate that in that hour you profitably touch it with your hand, and if you see anything diverse there, rectify it and straighten it according to the quantity of your virtue.
And avoid vehement extension and compression, as many foolish doctors do who many times cause hot swelling to occur by their operation, or cause contraction to occur in the limb as we have seen this by their operation many times.
And the quality of the tightening of the broken limb is that which I recount; so that you know that broken limbs are diverse in their smallness and in their greatness and in their form.
And of those that are small such as the arm and the finger and the forearm and similar to those, then it is necessary that the wrapping be of soft, thin cloth.
But those that are large such as the thigh or the leg, it is necessary that for those there be a wide and hard wrapping, because the wide binding connects the large limb and tightens it from all sides with equal tightness, so that no blemish enters it.
And after beginning, after your evacuation of equation, place a binding suitable for this, over the place of that fracture with three or four wrappings according to what the limb deserves; and tighten your hand a little with the binding.
And after go with that to the uppermost part of the fracture site, and tighten less than your tightening with which you have tightened the fracture site. And after elongate yourself with wrapping from the fracture site a little, and soften the tightness little by little, until you take a large part from the healthy site.
And after take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken place with wrapping, and after go with the wrappings to the lower part of the fracture; and let your operation in the tightening of the wrapping and in softening of it be according to what we have said in the first wrapping above.
And after place between the windings of tow lion or cloth with which the tortuosity of the fracture is evened out, if there is tortuosity in it; and if not, do not place anything in it.
And after place another bandage over it, and after even out over these wrappings stars decently made immediately, if there is no swelling or hot abscess in the place, and then place over it that which calms that abscess and removes the swelling; and leave that for some days; and then you tighten the stars over it.
And let the stars be of the half of a wide, smooth cane, and well formed wisely; or let them be of pine wood; or of palm branches; and let the width of each star be according to this form and this figure:
However, it is necessary that the splint that is placed over that fracture be a little thicker and wider than the other splints, and the length of the splint according to what is allowed to the limb in magnitude and smallness; and after tighten over the splints with another bandage according to your first tightening; and after tie above with thread decently according to what we have said about tightening, and it is that your tightening should be according to the fracture site more, and the further it is elongated from the fracture, the lesser the tightening.
And it is necessary that the threads be medium in thickness and thinness, and be of soft linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen by the operation of some fools placing their threads of twisted linen ropes, and it is a great error, when the tightening falls outside equality.
And likewise thin threads are not suitable, because you will not achieve by tightening with those what you want, and it is not appropriate that between splint and splint there be less than one finger.
And if the patient is injured in the extremities of the splints near the constriction in healthy places, then place beneath them oakum or carded wool until it does not cause him injury.
Sometimes a fracture is with a wound, and a disruption occurs in the skin, and I will come with a reminder of that in the following chapter specifically.
And know that not every broken limb is tightened with splints on the first day; which is because the limb, when it is large, should not be placed on splints except after 5 days or 7 or more, according to your certainty of the onset of hot swelling.
And this is the manner of plasters with which the Ancients restored, which are placed on fractures and dislocations and sprains.
Method of common abridged plaster for restoring fractures, suitable for many complexions and especially for women and children, for it is of that upon which neither heat nor cold prevails: and it is that you take mill powder, and it is the core of the flour that hangs towards the movement of the millstone on the walls of the mill.
And prepare it as it is, except that you sieve it with egg white, and place the preparation of it neither thick nor thin; and afterwards use it.
Another method of plaster restoring fracture and dislocation and sprain: take asafoetida, labdanum, acacia, elecampane, and migrach, which is wild pomegranate root, of all 10 drachms each; of myrrh and aloe 5 drachms each; alochil 20 drachms; let all be ground and sieved and mixed with alochil water or with egg white if the patient's complexion is heated; and afterwards use this plaster, for it is of good composition and restores broken bones easily, and is beneficial to many men.
Another method of plaster which is beneficial for fracture and sprain: take migrach and put white marshmallow 10 drachms each; of myrrh and aloe 5 drachms each; of acacia 6 drachms; of Armenian bole 20 drachms.
Let all be ground in a mortar with much crushing, and be sieved, and be prepared with water or egg white and be administered.
Method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and it soothes pain occurring in them and for fissures and fractures: let unwashed wool be taken and be submerged in vinegar and cooked oil and be placed on the spot.
But in this plaster there is no virtue of restoration, of hot swelling and it expels pains specifically.
Another method of plaster that restores broken bone: take leaves of deaf fig and leaves of wild poppy; crush all and make a plaster of them.
Method of abridged plaster administered for the restoration of bone fracture and when you want resolution of the remnant of swelling: take roots of marshmallow, of chamomile and violet flowers, of vetch flour, of all 1 part each; let all be crushed and be prepared with wine, if the limb is not heated.
But if it is heated, then prepare it with water of moist coriander or with water and use it.
Another manner of plaster stronger in resolution than this first one, when a hard abscess occurs near the restoration of the limb: take root of marshmallow and flaxseed, and pomegranate flower, and melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, of all equal parts; let all be ground and mixed with willow water or fresh water or wine, all this according to the quality of the limb and the rest of its color.
But Hippocrates did not say in his book that anything should be placed on the broken limb for its restoration except a ceruse made of wax and oil and nothing else; and he recounted that it should be between thickness and subtlety.
But in Gaul it is seen that they place on the broken limb for its restoration things in which there is drying with a little heat such as myrrh, incense and similar things to those that we have recounted.
Manner of plaster that confers to lesion and pain: take crumb, chickpeas, cut human hair or bird feather, and marshmallow, and salt, equal parts; let them be ground and sifted and mixed, and let a plaster be made.
But the quantity according to which it is convenient that the bandage remain and afterwards be untied, is that you consider if there is no pain or itching and the broken bone has not moved from its place, then you do not untie for many days. And if there occurs at the place vehement pain or itching or swelling, then you hasten or untie that at the hour, and remove the plaster from it.
And take linen cloth and soft wet sea sponge, and submerge that in lukewarm water, and with that wash the place until that itching ceases and the pain is sedated; and afterwards let the limb rest for an hour; and afterwards place on it unwashed wool submerged in vinegar and oil or rose oil, and bind it for a night until you are sure of hot abscess, and that the swelling of the limb rests, and its pain is removed.
And afterwards repeat that subtle constriction and small plaster and do not tighten it with your first constriction, and refine with that until it is healed.
And if you see that the abscess and the redness and the pain and the swelling and all the accidents are already removed completely, and you need plaster and constriction, then you repeat that as you have done at the beginning equally.
And if there does not occur to the limb any of those things that we have said, then do not untie that except after three days or four or five or seven; and sometimes all this is left for twenty days according to what appears to you by the untying of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres, and approaches the coagulation of the flesh over it.
And then increase the constriction more than in your first entire constriction, and increase in the thickening of the patient's food, according to what is preceded by the remembrance of it.
But if you see the place of the fracture already drying and thinning more than is convenient, then know that nourishment is prohibited from reaching it; and then bathe that with lukewarm water every time that you untie it; and let this be in all three days; and lighten the constriction a little, and by this operation nourishment runs to the limb, and it is healed easily.
But what the foolish restorers of the fracture of the limb do another time when it is not restored at the beginning, as is convenient, and is restored according to tortuosity, is error according to their operation, and great fear, and if it were righteous this the Ancients would have enlarged in their books and would have worked with this.
And I have not seen any of them do this, wherefore it is more reasonable that this not be done.
Chapter Two: On fracture when it occurs in the head.
There are many types of fractures, and their shapes are diverse, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are made by the blow of a sword, and the blow removes all the bone down to the membrane, which is below the bone, as an axe does in wood, and for this reason this type is called axial; or the sword cuts a part of the bone, and cuts the flesh of it but does not pass through to the back of it; and this type of fracture is called absolute elevation.
And the wound of these two fractures is either large or small, and of fracture that is crushing or bruising; and its cause is impact with a stone or falling on a stone, and similar things.
And this fracture is either penetrating that already approaches the membrane which is below the bone; or it is on the face of the bone, and the wound of these two fractures is either large or small.
And of fracture there is one that is diminished in the bone, in the fineness of a small hair, and for this reason this type is called capillary fracture.
And there is a fracture that is made either by falling or by impact of stone and similar things, which causes some layer of the bone to enter the inner parts, and a concavity is made in the place as happens to copper cauldrons when they suffer an impact and part of them is pushed inwards.
And this mainly happens in bodies with moist bones, such as the heads of infants.
And to all these types of fractures are attached fragments, that is pieces like splinters separated. And I will come with a reminder of all this in its place.
And we know all these types of fracture by detection upon them and by investigation of them with probes and removal of corrupted flesh that is over them.
And the capillary type is known by this that is uncovered over the bone, and is cleaned, and smeared over it with ink, for the fracture appears black.
But in the cure of fracture consider at the beginning the symptoms of the patient, and then if you see by the symptoms that indicate by clear indication about fear, such as vomiting of bile, and extension, and loss of understanding, and loss of voice, and fainting, and acute fever, and protrusion of the eyes and redness of them, and similar to them of the symptoms in the major dispositions, without doubt he is not healed.
And if you see non-recurring symptoms you hope for health, then you begin the cure of him.
Which thing is that if the wounded has come to you at the beginning when he is wounded and this is in the days of winter, then it is fitting that you strive in the removal of the bone before the 14th day according to every disposition.
And if it is in the days of summer, then it is fitting that you hasten to remove the bone before the 7th day, before that which is below the bone is corrupted from the membrane, and that the symptoms occur that we have recounted.
And if the fracture has already reached the membrane covering the brain, and is with minute parts and bruising, then it is fitting that you cut the comminuted and bruised part, according to what I will recount to you.
And it is that you shave the head of the wounded patient, and uncover over the bone according to custom and manner possible to you according to the shape of the wound, and that it be light on the patient.
And if it happens to you towards the detection of the bone, flux of blood or hot abscess, then you oppose it with what is fitting, and it is that you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and make the wound rest until the abscess is settled, and you are sure of the flux of blood; and afterwards begin in the circumference of the bone and in the removal of it.
And this be according to one of two manners of operation.
And one method is that you cut the bone with a narrow chisel, and this is its form: And then use another chisel, a little wider than that one; and this is its form:
And then use a chisel wider than the second one.
It's advisable that you have a number of different chisels, some of which are wider than others; and some of them are shorter than others and are very sharp at their ends, and are made of Indian or Damascus steel.
Use them with care in striking the chisel so that you don't shake the head and harm it.
If the bone is very hard, then it's advisable to drill around its circumference before you use the chisels, with drills that are called non-penetrating drills.
They are called this because they don't pass through the entire thickness of the skull bone, because the drill has a round end or edge above the sharp part, like a small circle, which prevents it from submerging and passing through the thickness of the bone.
It's advisable that you have a large number of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of each bone, so that you have one for all skull bones, the end of which should be sharp, the length according to the thickness of this skull.
And this is the form of three types of drills: The method of drilling around the broken bone is that you place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated; and then move the drill to another spot, and place it between each hole at a distance of about the thickness of a needle.
And then cut with chisels what is between each hole in the bone, and make it as thin as you can with great care, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with some other tools which you have prepared for this, such as pliers and fine forceps.
It's important that you take great care that the chisel doesn't touch any part of the dura mater.
And when you have drilled around the bone, and it is separated from the dura mater if it was attached to it, and you have extracted it, you should scrape and smooth its rough edges with another tool similar to a chisel, but it should be thinner and finer than the other chisels.
If any small pieces of bone remain and are stuck, then remove them carefully with the tools you have; and after that, treat the wound with lint and the ointments we have mentioned.
And the other method of operation is easier, less frightening, which Galen described and praised highly; and this is his description: it is necessary for you at the beginning to start uncovering the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and most visible, until when you have uncovered that part and have placed under it the end of this gentle and pleasant chisel, of which this is the form:
And it is that the lenticular part is smooth and doesn't cut anything, and the sharp part of it is on two sides extending in length, as you see; that the lenticular part should be placed against the dura mater with its sharp cutting face on the bone.
And then strike the chisel on one side with a small mallet until you cut through the entire bone easily as it is turned, and you can be sure that no accident will happen to the membrane that you might fear in any way, even if the physician was the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them; indeed, even if he were sleeping.
Then if something remains attached to the bone of the membrane in some places of the bone, cut it from it with the extremity of that lenticular incision tool, and free it from it with ease, for it is freed from it without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the membrane, and what is cut or removed from the bone is its face, and roughness and subtle fragments remain in it, then it is necessary that you scrape that roughness and eradicate those fragments with subtle razors for which you have prepared a number, of diverse quantities so that it is possible for you to administer from them in every place the most convenient of them and the most direct of them according to what your operation leads you to that broken bone and its shape.
And it is necessary that you administer in your scraping with which you scrape the bone at the beginning the widest of those razors, and afterwards use after it the most subtle of it, and do not cease doing this continuously until you come to administer the thinnest and most subtle of all those.
But in each of the other small capillary fractures and subtle fracture, it is necessary that you administer care according to what leads to its rectification.
And it is a matter that is not diminished over all those who have studied in that art. And I stood on what we have written shown in great fractures.
And if the membrane is retained when you eradicate the bone, then it is necessary that you take linen cloth according to the quantity of the wound, and submerge that in rose oil, and place that over the orifice of the wound; and afterwards take another cloth doubled or tripled and submerge it in wine and rose oil and place that over the thin cloth and do this as lightly as you can over that, that you do not burden the brain; and afterwards administer over that wide bandage, and do not tighten it except by the quantity that holds the wound only.
And leave that with this care for a day or for two until you are sure of hot apostema; and afterwards untie that and afterwards administer medicines with which there is superfluous dryness, such as flax root and vetch flour, and powder of incense and birthwort, and similar to those.
And it is that you make of these medicines powder that is pulverized over the wound, as they are dry; and universally, administer in that every medicine of property of which is that it cleanses and does not bite.
And guard yourself according to your virtue that the wound in your cure be clean; and let there not be in it filth of ointment or other; nor do not let virulence aggregate in it; for when it is gathered over the membrane of the brain, it corrupts that and rots that, and befalls the patient after that evil malignancy.
And it befalls in the brain of the head, when of it the bone is cleansed and especially when the care of it is despised, and there is blackness in the surface of it; and then consider then if there befall the patient the accidents that we have said, know that it is pernicious without any doubt.
And if blackness does not befall except from the medicine that is placed above, and it is in virtue of that medicine that it makes that blackness, then it is necessary that you take of honey one part and of rose oil three parts, and with those anoint a cloth, and afterwards place that over the brain; and afterwards cure that with the species of cure that is convenient until it be healed.
Chapter 3
On the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that only two parts of the nose are broken together at the top, or sometimes one of them, because in it there are two bones, as the lower part is cartilaginous, and is not broken and does not suffer anything but abrasion and twisting and bending.
But if one of the two parts of it is broken, then you should insert the little finger into his nose, and straighten that fracture inside with your index finger, and with the thumb outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And let this be done by you with ease, and be careful that no pain falls upon the patient through your operation.
And if the fracture is in the uppermost part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it, then it should be evened out with the end of a stick which has a small thickness.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you do the same as this.
And hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible; and if not, then after the 7th or 10th day you should rest the hot swelling.
And afterwards insert into the end of the nose a wick of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part, or put two tents, if the fracture is in two parts, and let there be in the tent a thickness of such quantity that it fills the hole of the nose.
And some of the ancient restorers said that the tents should be soaked in butter, and should be changed every day, but it is not seen by me; rather, the wick should be soaked in egg white mixed with mill dust; and afterwards leave the tent until the bone is firm and the cartilage is hardened.
And sometimes a goose feather should be inserted into the nose, instead of a tent, after it is wrapped in soft linen cloth; and this is when the fracture of the nose is more severe and the patient is not prevented from breathing.
And this thing is not necessary for you; and if you want, do this, and if you want, make tents.
And if a hot swelling occurs again, plaster the nose with a wax ointment or with cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or with diachylon.
But if no hot swelling occurs, then you should plaster it externally with sesame flour and incense powder mixed with egg white; and afterwards place soft tow on it, and do not bind the nose with anything.
But if the bones of the nose are broken with a small fracture or are crushed, then you should cut over them, and extract them with instruments suitable for them; and afterwards sew the incision, and treat it with what incarnates and consolidates, and with plasters suitable for this.
And if a wound occurs inside the nose, then you should treat it with tents and administer lead cannulas until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4
On the restoration of the jaw when it is broken.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not with a wound, then observe if the fracture is only external, and not broken in two and is curved towards the inner parts, then its recognition is easy.
And so it is suitable, if the fracture is on the right side, that you insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert the index finger of the right hand; and push with it the bulge of the fracture inwards with ease to the outer parts, with your other hand on the outer part of the bone; with that decently equalize it.
And if the fracture of the jaw is already separated in two, then it is suitable that you administer extension of two parts according to straightness until its equalization is possible.
And if tooth movement occurs to disruption, then tighten those which you hope will remain with gold or silver thread or silk; and after place wax on the broken jaw, and after place a doubled cloth over it, and place over the cloth a large, decently made splint, or a piece of sole equal to the length of the jaw; and after tie it above according to how the binding of it is prepared for you and that suits the application, until it is not destroyed.
And command the patient to use rest and tranquility, and place his food as light broths.
And if you estimate that the figure is already altered in some way, then you hurry and untie it on the third day; and after rectify what is already altered of it and plaster it with mill powder, with egg white, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the wax from it, and place light wool over the plaster.
And then as that plaster stays attached and adjusted over it, and the disposition of the bone is not altered, leave it, do not untie it until it is healed and tighten the fracture; for many times this fracture is tightened in three weeks.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have said many times in its sedation until it is healed, and that abscess is removed.
And if the fracture is with a wound, then consider if a piece of bone is separated or splintered, then you subtly remove those splinters with what is suitable for that in the removal of those from the instruments.
And if the orifice of the wound is narrow, then you amplify it with the phlebotomy according to the quantity of your necessity.
And after when you have removed those splinters, and of those nothing will be left, then you sew the orifice of the wound if it is wide; and if not, place on it one of the plasters that are suitable for that and incarnate it, until it is healed.
Chapter 5
On the restoration of the collarbone when it is broken.
Many times the collarbone is broken on the front part towards the muscle, and that fracture is made in one of three ways.
For either it is broken, or separated, or it is separated in two parts other than that splinters do not occur; and it is easy to restore it; or it is so that splinters occur in it, and it is difficult to restore it; or it is so that the fracture is with a wound.
And the operation on it, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds the upper arm and follows the broken collarbone, and the other extends the neck towards that part.
And after equalize the fracture with your fingers until its form is made as it should be, and there is neither small protrusion nor concavity in it.
And if you need more extension, then it is necessary that you place under the patient's armpit a roll of cloth or wool, and let its size be according to the quantity of your need; and extend and elevate the collarbone and tighten the roll with your hand until you align the fracture as needed.
And if you cannot pull the extremity of the collarbone to the outer parts, because it has sunk deep, then it is necessary that the patient be laid on his back, and place under his shoulder a medium-sized cushion.
And the assistant should press his shoulder downwards until the collarbone bone that is deep down is raised up, and then you rectify the fracture and align it with your fingers.
But if you feel fragments of the collarbone and they are moved, then it is necessary that you cut over it and extract those fragments with ease.
And if it is retained in the bone, then you should make an incision of it with one of the cutting tools which you have prepared for this, after you have placed under the collarbone the instrument that protects the peritoneum; and it is an instrument of wood or iron of which this is its form:
And it is similar to a spoon of which this is the concavity; and let its width be according to what you need of it, according to the size of the bone or the smallness of it.
But its length should be according to what is possible for you in the operation; that it has two extremities as you see, and one extremity should be wide and the other narrow.
And if the disruption of the wound which you have cut when you have extracted the fragment from the bone is wide, and you are sure of hot inflammation, then you join the two lips of the wound with suture.
And if the disruption is small, or you fear hot inflammation, then you fill the wound with cloths and small pads according to the size of the cut of the wound.
And if hot inflammation occurs, then soak a cloth in vinegar and rose oil and wine, and place it over that.
And all, that the splint should not be moved from above the broken bone; and for this it is necessary that you see the patient every day, that when the binding is softened or you see the splint has already been moved, then you rectify this and tighten the binding.
And afterwards place the patient's sleep on his neck, and place under his armpit towards his sleeping side at night a small cushion; so that with it his upper arm is elevated on that side, and thus the fracture of the collarbone is elevated by the elevation of the shoulder; or let his arm be tied to his neck.
And do not untie the binding unless itching or inflammation occurs in the place, until 12 days.
And afterwards renew the plaster if you have seen its face for this, and increase in the tightening and restore it and leave until the fracture of the collarbone is restored and coagulated.
And it is tightened and comforted according to the month in 28 days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6
On the restoration of a fracture of the shoulder.
The shoulder blade is rarely broken in its wide part and only its edges are broken.
And so when the wide part is broken - and it is broken in the middle of it - and it is not known except by touch, then according to the shape of the fracture, strive to prepare it and reduce it to its natural shape by any means possible to you.
And after, place on the spot powder of mill with egg white and soft tow; and after place a double cloth compress; and after place on it a wide splint of thin board according to the size of the whole shoulder blade or a little more.
But if under the splint there is a concavity in any of the places of the shoulder blade, then you level that concavity with soft tow, and after raise the splint evenly.
And after tighten above with a long bandage with decent constriction and with firmness of the splint until it is not moved from its place.
And check the binding every day; and every time it is loosened, bind it again and tighten it and adjust the splint if it has moved from its place.
And let the patient lie on his healthy side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in 20 days or in 25.
And so when this number is completed, then you undo the binding, and you should be assured that it is one of the bones whose comminution is not feared nor their dissolution.
And if a piece of bone protrudes from the place and pokes under the skin, then you cut over it, and remove it, and do according to what we have said in the fracture of the clavicle about treating a hot abscess if it occurs there.
Chapter 7
On the restoration of a fracture of the chest.
The chest is sometimes broken in its middle part and this rarely happens; but its extremities are very often cracked and comminuted.
And of the accidents when its middle is broken is that it declines to the inner parts and great pain occurs, and difficulty in breathing, and cough, and very easily vomits blood; and a cavity is declared in the broken bone and is not hidden to the touch.
And its restoration is that the patient be laid on his back, and place a pillow between his shoulders; and after press on his muscles, and join his ribs with the hands on both sides, and be subtle in its operation and in the adjustment according to every manner that is possible and that is convenient to it, until the shape of the bone returns as it should.
And after place on it a plaster and tow and place above a splint of thin board of willow or of reed and similar to them in lightness, after you wrap it in cloth; and after be subtle in binding it over the broken bone so that it is not moved; and go with the binding according to roundness to the back sometimes, and tighten it with decent stricture; and after check the binding every hour, and when it is loosened tighten it.
And if necessity provokes to unbind it due to corrosion or itching, or pain, or an abscess that occurs in the place, then you hasten and unbind it and eradicate the plaster and rectify what occurs by this with the manner of curing it; and after replace the plaster, if you see fit; and add to it stricture until it is healed.
Chapter 8
On the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Know that fracture of the ribs only occurs in thick places that follow the back; and from their extremities of the front part, contraction does not happen to them except because they are cartilaginous. And knowledge of it is not hidden from the sense towards the inquiry of it with the fingers.
And the restoration should be thus that you equalize the fracture with the fingers according to the possible manner, until it is aligned as it should be, and afterwards plaster and tighten the broken bone with a splint, if it needs that.
And if the fracture of the ribs is declining to the inner parts, then severe pain and puncture occurs to the patient, just as puncture that occurs to one who has pleurisy, and because the bone pricks the membrane; and difficulty of breathing occurs to him, and cough, and vomiting of much blood; and this is of difficult cure.
And already the Ancients have contrived in that with many contrivances.
And of them is what they say: it is fitting that you set foods for the patient that generate inflation and windiness, so that the belly may be inflated and extended, and the fracture may be impelled to the outer parts.
But we abhor this because it may not be a light cause to generate a hot abscess, if it does not occur; and if it has already occurred, then it already helps with this.
And some of them said that a cupping glass should be placed above and afterwards that it should suck with strength; and it is similar to reasoning, but nevertheless it is feared that the cupping glass attracts the superfluities to the place due to the weakness.
And some of them said: it is fitting that the place be covered with wool that has already been submerged in hot oil, and that cushions be placed between the ribs until it is filled, that the bandage be equal when you wrap it according to roundness; and afterwards the patient should be cured with treatment of pleurisy of food and medicine.
And if a vehement cause constrains the patient which is not tolerated, and the bone pricks the membrane with a harmful puncture, we fear for the patient, then it is fitting that we cut over the place, uncover the broken rib, and afterwards place over it an instrument that preserves the peritoneum, the remembrance of which is preceded, and that we cut the bone with ease, and extract it.
And afterwards that we join the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with suturing, and cure it with plasters until it is healed.
And if an abscess occurs inside, then you hasten and soak cushions in rose oil and place on the location, and that the patient be cured with that which is suitable for the inner abscess.
And he should lie supine on the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Chapter 9
On the restoration of fractures of the spine and neck.
Sometimes fractures occur in the bones of the neck, and rarely contusions occur to them, and similarly to the vertebrae of the back. And when this happens to someone and you want to know if they will heal or not, then consider, because if you see their hands already softened and numb and dead and they cannot move them or extend or tighten them and when you squeeze them with your fingers or prick them with a needle and they don't feel pain in them, then know that they will not heal, and in most cases it is fatal.
And if they move them and feel constriction with the fingers and puncture, then know that the marrow of the bone is safe and that the patient will recover with treatment.
And if something similar happens to the vertebrae of the neck and you want to know if they will heal or not, then consider their feet.
Then if you see that they are already softened, the same thing happens to them that happened to the hands, and after when he lies on his back, wind and excrement come out without his will, and sometimes he is lying on his back and wants to urinate and cannot, then know that it is fatal, and then do not trouble yourself with his treatment.
But if none of those things happen, the case is better and easier.
And his treatment is that you strive to reduce the hot swelling by placing rose oil alone on the bruised vertebra, or with enough egg yolks; place that on it several times a day until the hot swelling is reduced.
And then place one of the strengthening and stimulating plasters, and tighten it with a bandage; and command the patient to rest and be tranquil and not to sleep on the part where he finds pain until he is healed.
And if near the bruise of the bone you find splinters or something that has already separated from it, then it is fitting that you cut into the skin and remove that bone; and afterwards join the two lips of the wound, with sutures if it is large; and afterwards treat it with some incarnative ointment, until it is healed.
But if the back of the bone is broken, and it is the end of the tail, then it is fitting that you insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and that you align the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible for a second alignment; and afterwards place a plaster on it and splint, if you need those, and afterwards tighten it.
And if you feel broken splinters in it, then you cut over it, and remove that, and treat the wound with the treatment that has preceded until it is healed.
Chapter 10
On the restoration of the hip.
The bones of the hips are rarely broken, and if they break, then their fracture is nothing but a crushing in their extremities and they are cut in the length and decline towards the inner parts; and the patient experiences pain in the place and puncture, and the leg is numb when it is fractured.
And its restoration is that you extend your hand over it until it is over the fracture which is its shape.
And if the fracture is in its extremity only, then you align it according to what is prepared for you by equal alignment until it is resembled to its natural shape.
But if the fracture is in the length or has already declined to the lower parts, then you make the patient lie on his belly until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you. And when you have evened that out, place it on the plaster, and then place a splint of wood or bark on it, and tighten it with a bandage over which you don't fear puncturing the fracture or removing the splint.
And even out the concavity with what fills it until it takes the bandage evenly, and order the patient to sleep on his back or on his healthy side.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you stop extending it and restoring it until the hot abscess subsides, and place on it what calms it as previously stated; and then return to restoring it, and tighten it as appropriate.
And if in the bone there are splinters or it is comminuted, then you remove them.
Chapter 11.
On restoring the fracture of the humerus.
The humerus is what is between the elbow up to the head of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, of which one is that you take a flat wood of medium thickness according to this form:
And two bandages are tied at the two ends, and then it is suspended from an elevated place.
And the patient sits on a chair; and then throw his broken arm over the wood until it reaches its armpit in the middle of which the curve of the wood is attached.
And then suspend over it some heavy thing, or the assistant extends it to the lower parts; and then the physician evens out the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns as it should.
And the other way is that the patient lies on his back and suspends the hand from his neck with a bandage; and then order two assistants that one of them hold what is above the fracture with his hands; and the other hold the lower part of it; and each of them extend to his side.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you tighten over the fracture with a bandage and over that with another bandage, and each of the two assistants extend to their two sides.
And so if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, then it is appropriate that half of the bandage be placed over the armpit and the other below the fracture towards the elbow.
And similarly if the fracture is close to the elbow, then it is appropriate that the bandage be placed over that place and over that elbow.
Even it out with ease and without effort, and then when it will be evened out as it should be and is applied with good application, then tighten it if a hot abscess does not occur.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave the tightening until the seventh day, and place on it dirty wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the abscess subsides, and then you tighten it.
And the way to tighten it is that you place a plaster over the fracture, and then place a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster; and then bring the arm close to that humerus, and place his open hand on his shoulder.
And place the cloth and tighten over the humerus the arm so that the arm is in place of splints, unless something from the broken bone prohibits this.
And then use splints.
And it is that you place over the fracture that splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints; and place between each splint the width of a finger, and let the length of the splints be according to the break with the addition of three fingers on each side.
And then tighten over the splints with the bandage which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is that your tightening over the place of the fracture should be tighter. And the further the fracture extends, the less tight the bandage should be.
And so if you see the placement of the stars and the structure as we have said at the hour in which you restore the limb to its position, then you do.
And if you fear a hot abscess, then you leave the structure and the stars until the seventh day as we have said.
And afterwards consider the binding in all parts for three days so that itching or swelling does not occur in the place; or food is prohibited from reaching the limb due to excessive tightness; and so rectify all this as we have said.
But if you are confident that none of this will happen, then do not untie the bandage except after three days or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on his back, and his hands be on his stomach.
And place on the aid a cushion full of wool evenly, and consider at every hour of the night or day that the shape of the broken limb is not untied or dissolved, or that the binding is softened, so rectify all this with your strength.
And set the patient's food according to the order which we have put before, so that the food is subtle at the beginning until it starts to tighten; and then it is appropriate that you thicken his food.
For it is customary for his aid and his leg to be tightened for 40 days; and then it is appropriate that they be untied and a bath be administered and be medicated with ointments which rectify that.
And if the fracture is widely crushed, then you do not untie from it the binding and the splints until 50 days or until two months.
Chapter 12.
On the restoration of a broken arm.
An arm is composed of two bones which are called two focils; of which one is small, and is the one that follows the thumb, and the other is large and is the one which is placed below the little finger, on the lower part.
And very easily the major focil is broken alone, or the small one, and very easily they are broken together.
And when the small focil above is broken, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when its focil below is broken the fracture of it is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that is when two bones are broken together.
So if the bone which is broken is the small focil above, then it is convenient for the doctor, towards its restoration, to place a small extension with ease until it is evened out.
But if the large focil is what is broken, then it is appropriate that he place a more vehement extension.
And if the two focils are broken together, then it is appropriate that you place the extension much stronger.
And it is appropriate that you place the shape of the hand towards its restoration and its extension stretched out on a cushion, and let the pulse of the hand be to the parts above, higher than all the other fingers, and the little finger be lower than the other fingers, and let the patient be sitting on a square chair.
And let there be a cushion before him at his height or in front of him, so that the patient does not incur fatigue.
And afterwards the minister extends the arm from the lower part with his hand or with a binding, and another minister extends above similarly.
And afterwards the doctor evens out the bone until he reduces it according to the best shape he can.
And if in the fracture of the bone there are splinters, then strive to reduce every piece to its place with your strength.
And if there appears in it a separated splinter that pierces the skin and you have no hope in its restoration, then you cut over it and remove it according to the manner which we have said above.
But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter for this, and so take the cure from that.
And if a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then you anoint a cloth with a cerot made of rose oil and white wax, and let it be between thick and thin, and tighten the cloth over it with a subtle tightening until the abscess has subsided; and then remove the cerot and apply a plaster prepared from mill powder with egg white, and then apply splints; and let the splint which is placed over that fracture be wider and stronger.
And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in the major dispositions, whether the fracture is in one bone or in two bones together.
And then place your tightening over the site of the fracture more strongly and more vehemently, and the more the tightening will be on the parts above the fracture or on the lower parts of it, place the tightening a little softer according to what is preceded by the remembrance of it at the beginning of the chapter.
And the cloths that are wrapped over the fracture should be soft, damp cloths, and not hard or rough, and the thread with which it is tightened should be of linen properly between thin and thick, as we have recounted.
And examine the limb and the bandage after a few days. And if any cause occurs for which rectification is necessary, such as itching which occurs in the limb, then it is advisable that you bathe the limb with hot water until that itching ceases.
And leave the limb unconstricted until it rests, and then return the tightening.
And if the tightening has already softened and the bone has already moved and similar to those, then rectify all this with your skill.
And consider further if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightening, for then it is advisable that you soften it a little and leave it for a few days until nourishment flows to it, and then tighten it again.
But if none of those things we have mentioned happens to the patient, then it is not advisable that it be untied until after 20 days or thereabouts.
And afterwards let the patient's hand be suspended by its power of agitating movement, and make him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is restored in 30 days or in 32 days, or very quickly it is restored in 28 days, and all this is according to the disposition of the complexions and the dispositions of strength.
Chapter 13
On restoring fractures of the wrist and fingers.
Know that fractures of the wrist and finger joints rarely occur, and what happens to them is usually bruising.
And when a fracture or bruise happens to the hand, then it's necessary for the patient to sit square and in front of you sitting equally, and then place their hand extended on it.
And then the assistant extends the broken bones and the doctor aligns them until they are joined with good connection.
And then it's necessary to apply a plaster and tow, if there's no hot swelling; and then place a splint on top according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
But if the fracture is in the inner parts towards the palm, then make a semblance of a cloth ball, and order the patient to squeeze it with their fractured palm; afterwards it should be tightened with a long cloth.
And let the splint be of leather with cloth in which there is lightness, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and tighten it as is appropriate.
But if the fracture is in the outer parts, then it's necessary to place a splint on top and another splint on the part below in the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply the bandage, as the hand is wrapped to the wrist between the fingers with bindings.
And if a fracture happens to any of the finger joints, then if it's the thumb, let it be aligned as is appropriate and then be tightened with the palm and if you want, place a small straight splint on it so that the fracture is elevated and not moved.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the middle one, or in the index, or in the little finger, or in the ring finger, then let it be aligned and tied with the healthy finger which follows it; or let them all be tied in continuation, which is better; or place a small splint on it, as we have said for the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, and after it, the disposition of hot swelling and oppose — with your operation — with what is appropriate when any of these things happen, according to what is repeated in the account of it.
Chapter 14.
On the restoration of a fracture of the thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often broken and it is evident to the touch as it is turned to the front and upper part.
And its restoration is done in this way: the bandage is tightened above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, and the patient is laid on his stomach and face.
And then the minister extends all the bandage to his part according to the quality, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is close to the root of the thigh, then the bandage should be close to the knee on the groin side, so that the extension falls upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.
And similarly if the break is close to the knee, then the bandage should be made close to the knee, and the extension should be to the lower parts.
And then the doctor aligns the bone with both his hands until he reduces it according to its natural appearance and the bone is joined by good connection; then it is appropriate to apply a plaster and tightening, if an abscess does not occur in the limb. But if an abscess occurs in it, then you leave it for a few days until the hot abscess has subsided, and then return to your treatment.
The tightening of it should be done thus: it is appropriate that you wrap a hard bandage over the fracture, and double it two or three times, and remove excess from it; and then wrap the leg until it reaches the heel and the root of the thigh.
And insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee to the lower parts, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two sides, and then wrap over the leg and thigh what is left over from the bandage.
And then place splints on the thigh at the location of that fracture, and place one of those splints on the leg bone.
And then fill the empty spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the tightening is consolidated.
And then begin with strong tightening from the middle over the fracture site with three or four wrappings, and the further you go from the fracture site with the bandage, your tightening should be less and lighter and softer.
And then extend to two ends of the thread to the lower parts until it reaches the ankle of the foot, and tighten both ends of the splints on the other side so that the bandage is not moved from its place.
And then leave the tightening on it, where it stays thus so that no corrosion or hot abscess or swelling and similar things occur to the limb; and if any of these things occur, then hurry to loosen it, and rectify what occurs all afterwards, as we have said many times.
But if in the bone there is a piece of bone which pricks, then it is appropriate that you align it as much as possible; and if not, cut over it and remove it, and treat with that which has been previously mentioned until it is healed.
And sometimes this fracture of the thigh is tightened beyond this so that splints are added to it, as we have said in the help and in the arm.
But however in its restoration done in such a manner, lameness does not occur to the patient; and if it is restored alone, beyond that the other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that he limps from which it is always.
And know that the thigh is tightened in 40 days or a little more or a little less, and all this is according to the diversity of complexions and other dispositions.
Chapter 15.
On the restoration of the fracture of the kneecap.
Know that fracture of the kneecap rarely happens, but bruising often occurs to it.
But if a fracture occurs, then it is only a fissure or hole in its parts, and this is with or without a wound, and above all this is with feeling.
And its restoration is thus: that what is broken of its parts be aligned with the fingers until it is joined and connected as much as possible by alignment, ease, and construction.
And afterwards apply a plaster and place a round splint over it, if you need one; and tighten above with a suitable bandage.
And then consider all the conditions which we have recounted in other fractures, such as hot swelling and similar to those, so that you oppose every accident with what is suitable for it until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
On the restoration of the fracture of the leg.
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is thick, and is named the leg bone; and the other is thin, and is named the fibula.
And each of the types of fracture that happen to the two bones of the arm can happen to these, and for this reason the restoration is done just as the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is the same.
And if both bones are broken together, the leg is turned to all sides.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is turned to the front parts.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you find it below, and it is one of those things that are not hidden from you.
And then administer extension and alignment and binding of the splints accordingly equally.
But it is suitable, if the fracture of the leg is ugly having many fragments, that the extension be less and lighter, and alleviate with your skill.
And in the leg there is some operation above the arm, and it is when you align the splints and complete all your operation, then you will take pieces of pine wood which is placed under the things which are placed in shoes, and are also made of palm branches; choose from those which have little thickness, and not from the thin ones, and let their length be according to the length of the leg, from the knee to the bottom.
And then wrap cloth over each in two wrappings according to its length, and place one over the part of the leg on one side and the other on the other side, and let them be from the knee to the lowest part of the foot.
And then tie the two splints in three places at both ends and in the middle, for with this tightening the leg is prevented from bending to the right and left side, and stays in a good position.
And a wooden arm is already administered according to the length of the leg; and let the leg be placed in it so that it preserves it from movement.
And it is especially suitable that you do this in fracture, and when there is a wound with it properly.
And afterwards consider the leg each day and study it with the utmost care, and guard it from swelling and inflammation or other similar things; and when any of these things happen, then oppose it with what is suitable until it is healed.
Chapter 17
On the fracture of the heel, the bones of the foot, and the toes.
The heel doesn't fracture completely; but the bones of the foot fracture sometimes; and the toes rarely fracture, and only suffer abrasion in most cases.
And if the bones of the foot fracture and you see those bones elevated above each other, then the patient should place their foot on the ground prepared as if walking.
And then place one foot on what is elevated of those bones, and then press them, and push, and align them until they return to their places.
And then place a plaster and stop above, and place under the sole of the foot a small board which has two flat ends.
And then tighten it with the foot with proper binding, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other things that you need.
And when three or four days have passed, then you untie the binding, because you will find the bones aligned, whether they are broken or dislocated, and the operation on them is as you know.
But if any toes are broken, then restore them, and align them as I have told you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. And then place on the broken toe a splint according to the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider than it; and then under the foot this board which I have described to you, and tighten it with proper binding.
But if what is broken of the bones are two or three or more, then you place on each toe a splint of its size wrapped in light cloth, and tighten the board at the lowest part of the foot, and let it be standing on one of the ends of the board outside the sole of the foot so that it holds with good retention.
And it is convenient for you not to forget to consider all the things which I have told you in the other fractures of the accidents that we have said; and oppose yourself to every accident with what is suitable.
Chapter 18
On the fracture of the woman's vagina and of the pubic bone and of the man's penis.
When the woman's vagina is broken, then make her sit in a square chair, and then incline her to the back part a little, and let her be held from behind.
And then the midwife fills the vagina with cotton, and let it be done in her vagina as a sphere; and then the woman should be shaken, and raise her back little by little, because all of this is thrown out until it is in front of the part of the vagina as a sphere and the broken bone returns.
And then place pillows on her back, and when she wants to urinate remove the cotton with ease and then urinate, and reduce and return it according to the manner in which you placed it at the beginning, and then return to her first pillow.
And do this for seven days or thereabouts, because it is restored.
And if you want, take a sheep's bladder and tighten over its hole a reed tube; and introduce the whole bladder into her vagina, and then blow into the tube with strength until the bladder is inflated inside the vagina, because the fracture returns.
And then let it be filled with cotton and stay for some days as we have recounted, until it is healed.
And when the pubic bone of man or woman is broken, then administer in its restoration and binding what we have recounted for the hip bone.
And what is right is not hidden in these nearby fractures that rarely occur, especially to one who has some study and use and understands this book of mine well; because that fracture indicates to you in the major dispositions a straight way in its restoration and in its binding, and therefore understand well.
But in the man's penis when it is broken, take a goose's throat, and put the penis in it; and then place over it a wrapping of cloth, and let it be wrapped, and then let it be left for three days or thereabouts, and let it be healed.
Chapter 19.
On the restoration of bone fractures when there is a wound.
It is convenient for one who suffers a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large like the thigh bone or the arm bone, or similar to that, that you hurry and bleed them immediately if the conditions for bloodletting are testified to you as we have said above.
And if the wound bleeds, then it is necessary that you hurry to retain it so that you powder over it crushed zinc, if you have nothing else present.
And after begin to restore the fracture on that same day, and do not prolong it, unless an abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you leave the restoration of it until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided, and do not approach it on the third and fourth day at all, for you will cause bad accidents to happen.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin uncovered, then it is necessary that you strive to reduce it and equalize it with your hands with ease and with little extension.
But if extension is not prepared for you and the equation of it with your hands, then you reduce it with your hands with this instrument; and it is an instrument which is made of iron, the length of which is seven or eight fingers and the width of which is according to the size of the wound; and for this it is necessary for the doctor to take three or four of these according to the quantity that is needed for this in the cure in every kind of fracture.
And let it be round, and let there be little thickness in it so that it is not doubled towards the compression on it at the time of the operation.
And let it be of sharp extremity to which there is a margin at its extremities; and let the top of it tend to thickness, and from the middle of it to the parts.
And this is the form of it:
And it is called in Greek "labre volentz atelarem", that is a small spatula.
Therefore it is necessary that the sharp raised extremity of it be placed on the extremity of the prominent bone.
And push it at once until the bone returns, and is equalized with some equation.
And then strive to equalize the extremities of the fracture between them, and if the extremity of the broken one is subtle, and the instrument does not take it by good acceptance, then it is necessary that you cut the extremity of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone at all with what we have recounted, then cut it with what is convenient to it of the cutting instruments which we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever manner is possible for you.
And after, scrape what remains in the bone of roughness and small scales.
And when the bone is reduced, and after the reduction the patient finds vehement pain hurting, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and then do this for you will confer great help to the patient.
When your restoration which you do to the bone is completed, then submerge a cloth in styptic black wine, and properly if it is in summer, and do not put on the wound wax or other thing in which there is oil, so that it does not make putrefaction and corruption occur in it.
And after administer splints at the time of your completion of the restoration of the bone, and leave the wound uncovered so that you cut the hole with scissors and use wrappings according to the size of the wound.
And guard yourself with all caution that you do not tighten the wound with the fracture, for many times foolish doctors have done this, and caused death or corroding disease or suppuration, that is sanies, to happen to their patients. And if your tightening is light, soft, different from the tightening of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or is a bad wound, and you fear over it some bad accidents which we have recounted, and you find pain in the place, then it is not convenient that you put splints on it, but make for it a wrapping of hard cloths in place of splints and tighten it with those.
And when after a day or two you see the wound beginning to form pus, then remove the cloth which you had placed over it with wine, and afterwards apply poultices, ointments with which we customarily treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
And it is advisable that you unbind the bandage and examine the wound each day morning and evening until it is consolidated and firm, and it is appropriate that the limb be positioned in such a way that the pus flows from it to the lower parts with ease.
If many days pass and the wound is not consolidated nor is the pus removed from it, then know that there are small fragments there, so it is necessary to probe the wound with a probe. And of those fragments, those that are separated remove and extract, those that are not separated on their own and are pricking the limb and causing pain, force yourself to cut those out as much as possible for you.
And if the wound develops gangrene or necrosis, that is, tissue death, or another type of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary that you apply to each of these what is appropriate for its treatment, of which an account has been given in its chapter.
And in this it is appropriate that my discourse remains and you keep your mind present: when a large bone is broken, protruding over the limb such as the thighbone and the humerus and similar ones of the large limbs, and that you do not attempt to pull it or extract it because many times death occurs because of this; rather, leave it until it rots, for it will fall off by itself after 20 or 30 days; and then treat the wound if it seems right to you, and if not, leave it.
Chapter 20.
On the treatment of nodules that occur in the site of some fractures.
Many times this nodule occurs in the site of healing of a fracture, and mainly near the joints, and the shape of the limb is disfigured by it; and it easily prevents the limb from its natural operation.
Then consider if the nodule is recent and apply to it medicines that have astringent properties such as aloe, incense, myrrh, sarcocolla, acacia, and similar ones; so that you take some or all of these, and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar, and place this on the nodule in tow, and bind these over it with good pressure.
And leave the bandage so that you do not unbind it for many days; and afterwards unbind it and repeat another, until the nodule is removed; or tighten over it a lead plate decently, because lead has the property of removing all that is swollen in the limbs.
But if the nodule has already turned to stone and is tight and necessity urges to remove it quickly, then cut it at the highest part of it, and cut away the excess and protrusion, or scrape it with some razors until it is removed; and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
On the restoration of a fracture when it is restored and afterwards the limb remains thin and weak not according to its nature.
When a bone fracture is restored, and afterwards the limb remains thin and weak, then this is not done except for many reasons: of which one is the multitude of loosening of the bandage and of its binding not done as it should be; or by excess tightness of the bandages until the nourishment is prevented from flowing to the limb; or by excessive fomentation; or by excessive movement not at the right time; or by scarcity of blood in the body of the patient and by his weakness.
And the treatment for this is to give food to the patient and make his heart tender until the blood is multiplied in him; and administer baths; and introduce joy and happiness to him.
And afterwards place pitch on the limb, so that the pitch draws much nourishment to it, or continue fomentation of it with lukewarm water, until the nourishment flows and returns to its natural shape.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of broken bones when they have healed crookedly and prevent their proper function.
When it happens to a member already healed after its recovery from crookedness and protrusion of the broken bone and swelling, and because of this the shape of the member is deformed, but the member is not prevented from its natural function, then you should not accept the word of one who thinks that member is newly broken.
But there have already been many foolish doctors and healers who have done this in our land; and this operation is very blameworthy, leading to great fear, the sign of which is deadly.
But if lameness and swelling are recent, then they should be fomented with lukewarm water in which softening herbs have been cooked, such as marshmallow leaves and roots, and melilot, and similar ones; and a softening plaster should be made for it such as well-made diachylon; or mucilage of marshmallow root should be taken and mixed with chicken fat or sesame oil, and plastered with that; or fat figs should be taken and crushed with pigeon droppings, and similar ones of the medicines that are named to reduce consolidation.
And sometimes it is dissolved with constant gentle friction with moist hands, and movement of the member should be administered to every part at all hours.
But if the crookedness has already gone before and has become strong and turned to stone and the need for its treatment with iron has arisen, then the uppermost should be cut and the continuity of the bone should be dissolved, and what is superfluous of its swelling should be cut away with the bone using subtle incisions, and ease should be administered to it with care and study.
Chapter 23.
On the discourse of dislocation.
Dislocation is the exit of one of the joints from its place, whereby it is prevented from movement, and the shape of the member is deformed, and it causes great pains and injuries to come upon the patient.
So when dislocation happens to someone, then one should strive immediately to reduce it, and not delay that reduction, because if it is delayed, the place becomes swollen and very easily with this the reduction of dislocation becomes difficult.
And therefore it should not be moved or stretched at the time of swelling, because many times it causes spasm and harmful pains.
But when this happens, then you should hasten to bleed the patient, and afterwards let it be until the swelling rests; and afterwards the member should be fomented with hot water and oil, and afterwards reduced with ease.
And every member should be treated with that which remembrance will come in its place.
And I have already ordered the chapters of dislocation according to what is preceded in fracture; from the uppermost part of the body to the lowest part.
Chapter 24.
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
Both jaws are rarely dislocated; and the dislocation of both happens in one of two ways: either they are slightly moved from their places, and are a little softened; or they are dislocated by a complete dislocation, until they are softened at the joint area until saliva runs from the patient and he cannot hold it nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is impaired in his speech.
But when the dislocation is small, then in most cases it returns by itself with little effort.
But if the dislocation is complete, then it is necessary that reduction be administered gently, and not delayed at all.
And it is that the assistant should hold the patient's head, and the physician should insert the thumb of one of his hands into the root of the jaw dislocation inside his mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or he should insert both his thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of his hands should be outside with which he aligns; and he commands the patient to relax his jaws and let them go on each side; and the physician aligns the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, and especially if both jaws are dislocated together, then administer evaporation with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both is made easy and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And then when we return and they are aligned, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place cloth powders with cerate on them, and let it be made of wax and rose oil; and afterwards tie it gently with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on his back, and let his head be between two pillows, so that it does not move to the right side or to the left; and do not force him to chew anything; rather let his food be light broth, until when the pains are removed and the jaws are joined, then he may move what he wants.
And let this be administered with ease, and do not labor over the opening of the mouth towards eating and drinking and yawning, until the jaw is joined and healed.
And if the reduction of two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some time and are not converted to their places, then many times fevers and persistent headaches occur, and very soon the patient's belly is loosened, and very soon he vomits pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is perdition; and many times he to whom this happens dies in 10 days.
Chapter 25.
On the reduction of dislocation of the clavicle and the extremity of the shoulder.
The clavicle is not dislocated on the inside due to its continuity with the chest; and sometimes it is dislocated to the outside part, and this is evident to the touch.
And its restoration is that the patient should lie on his back and extend his arms. And afterwards constrict the place with your palm with strong constriction, for it will return.
And afterwards place a plaster and powders on it and tighten it.
But the extremity of that which follows the elbow and is continuous with it, is not dislocated in any day; then it is necessary that it be reduced and aligned as we have said and as is prepared for you.
And afterwards place a plaster on it, and powders, and a bandage, and command the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until he is healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the shoulder is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
On the reduction of muscle dislocation.
Know that the muscle is only dislocated in three ways, of which one is that it is dislocated from the armpit area to the lower part.
And the second is that it is dislocated to the upper part of the muscle, and this happens rarely; and it is not dislocated to the back parts because of the shoulder; and it is not dislocated to the front parts because of the nerves.
And it is mainly dislocated and comes out towards the lower parts near the armpit, and especially in those who have little flesh, it is easily dislocated; but in those who have much flesh, it comes out with difficulty.
And very easily it happens to some men by a blow or a fall, and their muscle becomes inflamed with a hot swelling, and it is thought because of this that it is already dislocated.
Then it is necessary that you examine this until you are certain of it, and then proceed with its treatment.
And the dislocation is known when it is in the lower parts near the armpit; so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle, for you find between them a manifest difference; and you find in the head of the muscle a concavity and below the armpit towards the touch of the muscle head as if an egg, and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all directions.
If it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards, and you then find a manifest touch, and it is not hidden.
And from this dislocation, an easy reduction is made when it is fresh and the patient is a child.
And its reduction is that the assistant raises his hand to the upper parts; and then place your thumbs below his armpit, and raise the joint with strength upwards to its place, and the assistant raises his hand, and extends it upwards; and then place it below for it returns easily.
But if by what we have said it does not return, and it is from the beginning when the dislocation occurred, many days, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in hot water and an embrocation be administered that softens and soothes as if roots of marshmallow, and fenugreek, and melilot are cooked in water, and be administered.
And then the patient should lie on his back and a sphere of wool should be placed below his armpit that is equal between lightness and tightness, and then the doctor should place his heel on the sphere, and raise the head of the muscle with strength, and pull the patient's hand so that it is not moved to the lower parts, and another assistant should hold the patient's head, so that it is not moved to the lower parts, for it then returns to its place.
And if you want, reduce it according to this manner: and it is that you have present a man who is taller than the patient, and he stands on the side of that side, and puts his muscle under the patient's armpit and raises his armpit to the upper parts until the patient is suspended in the air, and another assistant pulls the patient's hand from the lower parts of his belly. But if the patient is light, then it is necessary that with him another thing be suspended, so that it weighs him down, for the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is reduced also in another way: and it is that a long piece of wood is fixed in the ground the head of which is round in shape, like a mortar pestle, that is neither thick nor thin, and then it is placed under the patient; after soft cloths are placed on the head of the wood, and the patient is standing according to the length of the wood, and then his hand is extended to the lower parts of the other side; and his body is extended on the other side with strength, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
And if it is difficult to reduce it for all the reasons we have mentioned, then use this cure: take a piece of wood whose length is two arms' length, and whose width is four fingers, and whose thickness is reduced at the depth of the armpit according to this shape:
And then on the round end, let lion-colored cloth be tied so that the wood does not harm the patient.
And then let it be placed under the patient's armpit, and let the hand or arm be extended over the wood up to the lower parts, and let the wood be tied over the upper arm and the arm and the extremity of the hand.
Then let the arm be placed on a step of a ladder according to its width, and let the hand be extended to the lower parts, and let the other body be suspended on the other side, for the joint will enter soon.
And when its entry is completed in whatever way is possible for you, then it is fitting that you place under the armpit a sphere of wool of equal quantity; and then place a plaster prepared from mill dust with incense and egg white over the entire muscle, as is wrapped above, and then tighten under the armpit with a proper binding; and let the bandage be wrapped over the plaster, and let his hand be attached to his neck, and let it be left, and let his hand not be moved for 7 days.
And it is fitting that the patient's food be small, until the limb is strengthened, for it is easier for its healing.
And after the food should be given in greater quantity after 7 or 5 [days] and let it be exercised with a movement; and then if it is fixed and not softened, then it is already healed.
But if the joint is dislocated many times due to humidity that befalls it or for another reason, then it is fitting that in that case cautery be administered with three holes, as is said before in the chapter on cautery.
And if all this is done and after 7 days the bandage is untied and the joint is not fixed, and the plaster and the binding are reapplied to it several times, and it is not fixed and falls and cannot raise that arm to the upper parts, then know that its nerves, which are at the head of the muscle, are already cut or extended or softened, and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
For the dislocation of that which is made towards the chest and the breast or the back parts, the reduction is made with pushing and extension with the hands, until it returns.
And let the other binding be administered to it, and cure it until it is healed.
And if after the healing, heaviness occurs in the limb and slowness in its movement, then let the patient use baths many times until that heaviness is alleviated and it returns to its original nature.
Chapter 27.
On the treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it can be dislocated in all directions, mainly to the front and back, and its dislocation is not hidden from you because it falls under sight or touch depending on how it is dislocated, and when you compare the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it is clearly evident to you, because the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm, nor touch its muscle with it.
And it is necessary that you hurry, and reduce the dislocation immediately before a hot swelling comes to it, because if a hot swelling comes to it, its reduction is difficult, and it may not heal completely; and especially when it is in the back parts, because it is worse than all other types of dislocation, and of greater pain, and many times death descends with it.
And its restoration, when it is possible to reduce it, is that his hand should be extended with both hands, and his arm should be expanded, and the doctor's hands should be above and below the elbow, and he should push the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the base of his palm until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is in the front parts, then return it so that he doubles the hand with his hand, until he strikes the elbow with the base of his palm.
And if the dislocation does not obey the reduction, then administer vehement and very strong extension.
And it is that two assistants extend the arm, and two assistants also hold it so that it is not moved away from the extension.
And afterwards, the arm should be rotated in all directions, after a long doubled cloth is wrapped over his hand, or a bandage.
And when the doctor touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil so that these are the things which help in lubricating the joint with ease; and afterwards push the joint with vehement force until it returns.
And after its reduction, it is necessary that a plaster be placed on it in which there is astringency and drying with egg white, and it should be tightened with a descending stricture, and the arm should be suspended from the neck, and left for some days.
And afterwards it should be untied; and then if the joint is formed in its place, then you untie its bandage and leave it.
And if you see the joint not tightening well, then you repeat the plaster and the bandage, and leave it for some days until it is tightened; and afterwards untie it.
But if heaviness occurs to it after the reduction of the joint, and its disposition is in movement, then administer moistening in a bath and subtle friction, and compression, until it is relieved; or place on the joint "aleliati", that is, fat mutton thigh; and afterwards let it be bound, and leave it on the bone day and night. And afterwards remove it, and put it in a bath; and when it sweats, then you rub the joint with moderate friction, and afterwards repeat on it "aleliati", that is, mutton kidney, once, and a second time, and a third, corruption has already come upon the... entry of bath, until it is smoothed.
And if you want, place on it a moist cow's split warmed with butter and tighten over it; and do this several times, because it is moist and reduces to its disposition.
Chapter 28.
On the treatment of dislocation of the wrist, which is the joint between the arm and the hand.
The wrist is sometimes dislocated, and the reduction of its dislocation is easy, contrary to other joints, but it is necessary to act quickly in reducing it at the time it is dislocated, before the area becomes swollen or a hot abscess develops.
And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the patient's wrist on a table and the assistant extends their hand, and the physician places his hand or palm over the prominence of the joint, and pushes it until it returns to its place.
However, it should be considered if the palm is already turned to the inside of the hand, then the patient should place the back of their hand on a table for extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is towards the back of the hand, then the position of their hand should be intrinsically on the table, so that the physician's hand falls on that prominence of the joint.
And if it returns immediately, it is good; if not, then tighten it with a plaster to reduce the swelling and leave it; and do not repeat this, because otherwise, it will not be tolerated nor can you attempt the reduction after days have passed.
However, the joint remains according to its distortion; and it does not harm the patient in any way, except that the hand is softened and cannot grip anything; then know that the nerves are cut or crushed, and then there is no remedy except to tighten it with cautery near its fall, and this may confer some benefit.
Therefore, when the wrist is returned, then place on it the plaster which we have described, and let it be left and tightened for 5 days; and afterwards let it be untied and left, and let the hand be exercised.
But if its movement is impeded and some heaviness occurs in it, then soothe it with hot water and with friction sometimes, until it is relieved.
Chapter 29.
On the treatment of dislocation of the fingers.
Sometimes the fingers are dislocated in any direction.
And when any of those fingers is dislocated to the back of the palm or to its inside, then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs, until it returns.
And afterwards support the tip of the finger, and suspend it towards the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
And afterwards suspend it and extend it until it is straightened equally on that day.
And when night comes, bind it according to this description, and do not cease to untie it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night; and do this for some days until it is tightened.
And do similarly with this, if it is dislocated to the inside of the hand, and bind it to that part and do with this your first operation, until it is healed.
And similarly do with this when it is dislocated to other parts.
Chapter 30
On the treatment of dislocation of the spine vertebrae.
When a complete dislocation occurs to any of the spine or neck vertebrae, and many vertebrae are moved from their places, then there is no cure for this, as death hastens to the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's excretion comes out involuntarily, and they cannot retain it; and often some of their limbs are softened, or both legs, or both arms, or one of these; or a vertebra is moved from its place, for often it is moved and often the removal of these is done in four parts.
Therefore, this has already moved to the back parts and is called hunchback.
But its treatment is that you then consider if the hunchback occurred from childhood, for then there is no cure for it nor is there any complete healing of it.
But for that which comes from falling or from impact or similar to these, the Ancients have already described the methods of treatment with lengthy discourse, of which most return with benefit; but I have already abbreviated that of which little excuses too much of it, due to my proximity to my intended exposition, with which I have explained this and formed from diverse instruments with which they showed this and explained it.
And of these, none is cured except that which occurs in the back properly with what I recount.
And it is that the patient should be extended on their face on a level hill near a wall, and a soft instrument should be extended under them so that their chest is not injured.
And after, a straight beam should be placed, fixed in the ground at the edge of the hill around their head, and another beam around their feet at the other edge of the hill.
And the minister should hold the beam, and it should not be fixed in a pit; and another minister should hold the other in the same way.
And after, wrap a firm lion binding over the patient's head and under the armpits; and extend the end of the binding to the beam which is towards their head, and tie it to it; and after tighten the other binding over their hips, their knees, and towards their legs; and after join all the bindings and tie them to the other beam which is towards their feet.
And after, each minister should extend the binding to the part of the beam, and the two beams and the bindings should not be moved from their places in which they are fixed, but however they are not fastened as we have said.
And the doctor should place his palms on the vertebra with strength until it returns, or place a board over it, and after that add his feet on the board until it returns.
But if it does not return by this method, then take a board of which the width or length is about three arms' length, and carve in the wall which we said is near the patient a place in which the end of the board enters. And after, place half of the board on the vertebra, and the doctor should place his feet on the other end, and press well until the vertebra is constrained and returns to its place.
And if you wish, work with a lathe which is turned by hand; and it is that you fix in the ground towards the patient's head at the back of the hill two beams, the length of which should be one arm's length, and towards their head at the back of the hill likewise two beams; and let the length between each beam be one palm, and already made in each beam a hole in which the lathe runs, and each should be very firmly fixed in the ground so that it is not moved.
And let a round beam be placed in which is the lathe, and let it be revolved in the two holes of the two beams.
And at the extremity of it is a hole in which the shaft is formed, the length of which is a palm with that which is revolved; and in the two other shafts it is similar to that one.
And after, tighten the bindings that you have tightened on the chest of the patient in the hole which is towards the head of it, and the bindings that you have tightened on the thighs of it in the turn which is towards the feet of it.
And after each turn, let a minister stand who twists the turn with his hand, and the doctor aligns the spine as we have said.
And after the spine is returned, and the place is aligned, then it is appropriate that you place a drying plaster with egg white, and after that, tow; and after place over the plaster a splint of board of which the width is three fingers or thereabouts, and the length of it is a quantity that covers the place of the hump, and over the healthy part of the spine.
And after it is bound with a binding which we have mentioned, and let the patient use subtle nourishment until he is healed.
And if some protrusion remains in the place at the end of the healing, then it is appropriate that medicines are administered that soften and smooth with the administration of the board for a long time, which we have recounted; and a lead plate has already been administered in that place.
And sometimes a protrusion occurs in the back of the spine, and it is thought to be a dislocation; and it is that bone which already protrudes because it is not appropriate that a presumption be made to it with this medicine, for it will very easily cause death to you.
Chapter 31.
On the cure of a dislocated hip.
Know that the joint of the hip and the joint of the shoulder only suffer dislocation, and that which happens to the other joints of small removal and concavity does not happen to them.
And the joint of the hip is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated to the inner parts, or to the outer parts, or to the front parts, or to the back parts.
And mostly it is dislocated to the inner parts, and little to the front parts or to the back parts.
And the sign of its dislocation to the inner parts is that, when you join the healthy leg of the patient with the sick one, it is longer and the knee is more prominent than that of the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend his foot towards the groin, and the place that follows the groin is swollen with a hot swelling, because the head of the thigh has already arrived there.
And the sign of one to whom dislocation occurs to the outer parts, is that his symptoms are contrary to this symptom.
And the sign of one to whom dislocation occurs to the front parts is that he extends his leg completely, but however he does not bend it without pain that is in the knee, and if he forces himself to walk he cannot do so to the front parts; and his urine is retained and his groin is swollen, and his walking is on the heel.
And the sign of one to whom dislocation occurs to the back parts is that he does not extend the knee, nor can he bend it before he bends the groin, and his leg is shorter than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is towards that place.
But the reduction of the types of this dislocation is that you consider, then, if the dislocation is old and ancient, that it has already settled with the one having it after you administer its reduction and it remains according to its disposition, then there is no cure for it at all; and then it is not appropriate that a presumption be made in it.
But in one whose dislocation is recent, and is one of the four types of dislocation, then hurry to turn the joint and extend it to the inner parts and to the outer parts, and move it to the right and left, for it will very easily return and you will not need another cure.
But, if it does not return in this manner, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant and extend the leg of the patient from the lower part, either with his hands or with a bandage which is tied above the knee; and another assistant extends the hand of that person above so that he puts his hands below the patient's armpits; and afterwards tighten with a lion bandage above the root of the thigh, and let another third assistant hold the end of the bandage.
And let the extension be of him or of the inner part to the groin to the part of the collarbone, or from the back part to the part of the back.
And let the extension of all these be at once until the patient is raised with his body from the ground and remains suspended.
And this kind of extension is a common kind for all four.
And then if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then it is necessary for every kind what I will say about the proper cure.
In the proper reduction of it, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is to the inner parts, it is necessary that the patient be laid on his healthy side; and afterwards place the bandages on the root of the thigh in that place which is between the head of the thigh and the place that is below the groin; and afterwards extend the bandage upwards from the part of the groin to the highest part of the collarbone.
And afterwards another strong assistant should take his arms, and reduce the thick place of the sick thigh and extend to the outer parts by vehement extension, for that returns to its place.
And this kind is of easier cure with which this member is reduced than the other kinds.
But if it is excused upon you and does not obey the entry with this kind of cure at all, then it is necessary that the two feet of the patient be tied together with a strong, light bandage, over both ankles and both knees.
And let the length of each from its pair be the quantity of four fingers, and let the sick leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
And afterwards let the patient be suspended over the head of the wood, and let it be in the house; and let the length of him from the ground be the quantity of two arms.
And afterwards command a strong young man to decrease the head of the thigh, and let another young man be suspended with the patient, and the other young man decreasing the thigh with strength push, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
But in the proper reduction, when the dislocation is to the outer part, it is necessary that the patient lie on a hill as we have recounted in the one having a hump; and let the bandage be tightened over the sick leg properly and over his chest.
And afterwards two woods should be placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head; and afterwards let joined woods be placed in the middle of the hill fixed on which wet clothes are wrapped, so that the patient is not damaged because the wood is between his thighs, so that towards the extension to the lower parts it is not attracted.
And afterwards let each assistant extend to his part, and the doctor with his hand equalizes the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is to the front parts, then it is necessary that the leg be extended lightly, and it is according to this same narration on a hill; and the doctor places the palm of his right hand over the sick groin, and afterwards constrains it with the other hand, and with that constraint places that extended to the lower parts to the part of the knee.
And if the dislocation is to the back parts, then it is not necessary that the patient be extended to the lower parts, and is raised from the ground; rather it is necessary that he be placed on a hard thing, as it is necessary the same if his hip is dislocated to the outer parts, according to what we have said of his lying on two hips; and it is on his face and the bandages are extended, as we have said, not long ago.
And it is necessary that compression be administered with a board over the place where the joint protrudes.
Therefore, when the reduction is completed as it should be — and the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you, and it is that you extend the patient's two legs, and when you see them equal and the patient stretches his leg and expands it without excuse, then know that the limb has returned as it should — and then you join the two thighs and apply a plaster and tighten with a bandage so that the hip is not moved in any of the parts; and the patient should adhere to rest for three or four days.
And afterward, untie the binding and the plaster, and compare one leg with the other.
Then, if you see them equal in appearance, then know that the dislocation is already fixed, and then let the patient go.
And if you see any sign of softening, then you return and plaster it, and tighten it according to your first tightening, and leave it for three days.
And afterward untie it, and make him delay in walking on each for some days, until it is strengthened.
Chapter 32.
On the cure of dislocation of the knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways, for it is dislocated to the outer parts, and to the inner parts, and to the lower parts but to the back parts; and to the front parts it is not dislocated.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the patient to apply his leg with the thigh; then know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration of all its manners is that you make the patient sit upright, so that he extends his leg, if he can do so; adhere your back to his face, and place his foot between your feet; and afterward make his knee adhere with your palms, and hold them between your fingers over his knee with strength, and another minister extends his foot until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its reduction is that his leg adheres to the thigh with effortless lightness.
And afterward plaster it and make the leg adhere to the thigh, and afterward tie them together with a bandage for three or four days, and afterward untie them.
And the patient should not use walking for some days, until it is healed and strengthened.
But if its reduction is excused to you, then administer strong extension with bindings of which in the cure of the hip preceded narration.
Chapter 33.
On the cure of the dislocation of the ankle.
The ankle sometimes is moved by small movement, and sometimes is dislocated completely, and its dislocation is made either to the inner parts or to the outer parts.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the ankle swollen proceeding to the part to which it is dislocated.
But the cure of its removal is of easy reduction, and it is that it be extended with ease with the hands and be equalized until it returns.
But in its cure when it is completely dislocated, it is necessary that you make the patient sit upright, and a strong and valiant minister holds him from the back part of his back in the middle place of it.
And afterward you hold with your right hand the foot from the uppermost part, and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot in the place of the ankle.
And afterward pull the foot to you with your right hand, and afterward with the left for two times, and afterward extend with the left; and push the chest of the foot with the right towards the leg without effort.
And do this twice as we have counted.
And afterward push the chest of the foot to the leg the third time, and you are at the ankle.
Therefore it returns in one or two times according to this manner, and if you see the foot evened out, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it, for it will return.
But if the reduction is prohibited to you with what we have recounted, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and fasten a stake firmly in the ground, and let it fall between his thighs, and you have already wrapped a cloth over him so that it does not hurt the patient.
And after, the minister of him should hold his thighs, and after another minister should extend the foot with his hands or with a binding that ties over the neck of the foot; and after extend each minister against the extension of his partner, and the stake should be standing between the thighs of the patient retaining him, so that his body is not drawn to the lower parts towards his extension.
And after the doctor evens out the dislocation with his hands, and another minister holds the healthy thigh to the lower parts, for the dislocation returns with ease.
And therefore when the dislocation returns and the health of its reduction is declared to you, then place a plaster and tighten it with bindings strongly, and tie the foot with a binding to the leg.
And it is advisable that you fear or guard against the nerves which are behind on the heel, so that the binding on it is not violent and hurts it strongly.
And after leave that for two days or for three; and if the binding is softened, tighten it.
And after untie that on the third day or on the fourth, and prohibit the patient from walking for 40 days. But if he is forced to walk before that time, there is no assurance that the dislocation will not be dissolved and corrupted on him, and after that it will not receive healing.
And if a hot abscess happens to him, then it is advisable that you administer in its soothing that which preceded our narration, in another place of healing and of embrocation, until it is removed.
Chapter 34.
On the healing of dislocation of the toes.
It is advisable that that which is dislocated be evened out with little extension without trouble; and that which is not difficult, but is light.
But if the dislocation is in some joints of the back of the foot, then it is advisable that you make the patient sit his foot on an even place on the ground or on a table, and be standing as if he were walking.
And after you stand on foot, and place your foot on that which protrudes from the joints, and after press that with your foot with strength until it returns, and that you see that already evened out and no protrusion appears in the place.
And after place under the sole of his foot a board that takes all the foot, to which are two ends, and after tighten that with decent and firm tightening for three days; and after untie that and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is tightened and assured of return.
Chapter 35.
On the types of dislocations that are made with wounds or with fractures or with both together.
When any of these things happens, and you strive in the cure of it and in the restoration of it, many times death follows.
And for this reason it is not advisable that anyone presume to cure it, except one who is wise in the art, of long experience, merciful and compassionate, cautious, not bold nor presumptuous; and who uses in the beginning medicines that only reduce hot swellings, and leaves the patient to divine judgment, except for those for whom you hope for salvation from perdition, with alleviation of the illness, and in which appears some hope. And then strive immediately to make the reduction of it at the beginning of the matter, before a hot swelling occurs.
And then if the limb returns as we want, then administer a regimen which reduces hot swelling and cure the wound with what is suitable for it from the drying ointments.
And if dislocation is with fracture and occurs in the bone with separate fragments, then you strive for their alignment, and do in this what we have said in simple illnesses about what has preceded in their places.
And guard and avoid according to your virtue that of entering into ways of fear according to what has preceded my preaching to you; for this is better for you towards your Creator, and more permanent to your glory, and more salutary to your body truly those in your time. Here end the words of Albucasim perfectly of which God be blessed. Amen.
