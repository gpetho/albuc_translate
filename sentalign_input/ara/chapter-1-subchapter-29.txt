Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On Cauterizing Warts.
The ancients mentioned cauterizing cold warts with birthwort roots in this manner: Take one of the longest dry roots of long birthwort that you can find, about the thickness of a finger. Then dip it in oil and set it on fire.
Then cauterize once between the connection of the clavicle and the neck, and twice lightly below the jugular veins, inclined towards the area below the chin, and twice deeply above the breasts between the third and fourth ribs.
And also cauterize twice between the fifth and sixth ribs, inclined slightly towards the back, and once in the middle of the chest, and once above the stomach, and three times on the back: once between the shoulder blades and twice on the sides of the back below the cauterization that is between the shoulders.
And you should not deepen your hand with the cautery, but it should be on the surface of the skin, a superficial burn. Some of the ancients mentioned that some people used an iron cautery, similar to a probe, and they heated it and inserted it between the ribs until it reached the wart itself.
And the pus comes out as we mentioned in the case of liver tumors. This reckless cauterization is very dangerous; either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops in the area that cannot be healed.
