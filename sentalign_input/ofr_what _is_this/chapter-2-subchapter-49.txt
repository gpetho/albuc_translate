of the rupture of the artery
When the artery is ruptured, and the skin above it is closed, an abscess often forms, and the same happens with a swollen and abscessed vein; and it is recognized as being from the artery if the abscess is long and deep; and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a tightening; and when it is from the vein, redness from the outside is apparent; and it is foolish to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits, and in the groin, and in the neck, and in many other places, and is very large.
It is therefore necessary to avoid the use of iron instruments, and to also avoid the one at the top, and in the case of swelling from a ruptured artery, make an incision along the length of the skin above; then open the cut with hooks, and carefully separate the artery from the tissues until it is exposed; then insert a needle underneath it, and push it through to the other side, and tie off the artery with a double thread in two places, as I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples; then prick the place between the two ligatures with a lancet so that the blood that is there comes out, and the abscess is drained; then apply treatment that generates pus until the ligatures fall off; then treat this with a suitable ointment until it is healed; and if the abscess is due to a cut in the vein, you must hold in your hand as much of the abscess as you can along with the skin, then insert the needle under the part you are holding, and push it through, and have a double thread there, so that you pull it to the other side; then tie off the abscess, as I have told you, by tying one of the two sides with the two ends of the thread; and if you are worried that the thread might come out, insert another needle with a thread underneath the entire abscess at the incision of the first needle, and tie the threads in four places; then cut the abscess so that the excess comes out, then cut the excess flesh and leave what is tied; then place a cloth soaked in wine and oil on top, then apply treatments of tents and ointments until it is healed.
