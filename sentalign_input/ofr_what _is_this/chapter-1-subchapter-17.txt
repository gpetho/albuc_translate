on the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula as we have described in the sections on diseases, and your treatments are not effective, then you must cauterize it in this way.
Instruct the patient to place their head in your lap; and the practitioner should hold their head between their hands in such a way that they cannot move or shake their head; then place cotton moistened in egg white or purslane juice on the eye; then heat the cautery, which is like this: and is shaped at the end like the feather of a vulture, similar to how the cautery should be; if you wish, it may be pointed from one end to the other, or if you wish, it can be like a tent; however, this one that is shaped is better for your work.
Then squeeze the fistula if it is open, and draw out the pus, and dry it; and if it is closed, open it, and draw out the matter; then apply the very hot cautery, and hold your hand on the cautery on the side of the nose above the eye, so that your hand does not make a mistake; and place the cautery in the fatty tissue of the eye, and destroy it.
If you reach the bone at the beginning of the cauterization, that would be good.
If not, repeat the cauterization once more, and again if needed, and leave it for three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter, and treat it with the desiccative ointment until it is healed, and if forty days pass and it is not healed, apply a sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed; and treat it according to what is appropriate in its chapter.
And there is a method of cauterizing a fistula that some of the ancients described.
Make an incision in the fistula, and split the area; then put in the incision a thin reed whose form is as follows:
and make it the size of a lead weight of 3 [units]; and hold your hand or the reed firmly, and the patient should not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run into his eye; and it is necessary to place over the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white or water: the lead burns the fistula site, and heals it with marvelous efficacy.
And if the fistula is healed by the cauterization we have described, that is good.
If not, then it is necessary to administer medication through the syringe and return the fistula to the body of the syringe as appropriate to its proper place.
