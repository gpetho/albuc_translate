Chapter forty-one on incising the tumors that occur on the scalp.	CHAPTER FORTY-ONE. On opening superficial tumours of the scalp.	0.72009087
Small tumors appear on the scalp. And they are of the types of sal'a (wens/cysts), contained in membranes that have sacs like the crop of a chicken.	Small swellings form in the scalp, which are of the various kinds of cyst, contained within membranes which form a capsule to them like the crop of a chicken.	0.75944084
And its types are many, some of them are fatty.	There are many kinds of these.	0.5302832
And some of them contain moisture resembling pus and broth and the like. And some of them are petrified and hard.	There are fatty ones, there are those containing a liquid resembling black slime, there are those containing a liquid resembling porridge and gruel and the like, while others are stony hard.	0.7435874
And there is no danger in incising them and extracting their contents, unless an artery obstructs you when you incise it.	It is not dangerous to open and extract any of them, so long as you do not encounter an artery in excising them.	0.7892299
The procedure for incising it is to first probe it with the instrument whose image comes after this, which is called al-Midass (the probe), so that you know what it contains.	The operation for incising them begins by exploring them with the instrument called an explorer, figured lower down, so as to get to know what sort of contents they have.	0.66227514
So if what it contains is moisture, incise it lengthwise with a simple incision in this manner:	If they are the sort that contain fluid, incise them with a simple longitudinal incision, thus.	0.7413159
And begin the incision from line B to line C. Once the fluid has emptied, peel off the sac that contained that fluid and cut it all out, leaving nothing of it at all, for it often returns if anything of it remains.	Begin your incision at the letter b, to letter g; and when the humidity is emptied dissect away the capsule containing it, whole, not leaving the least remnant. For often it comes back if any has been left behind.	0.8115438
Then dip cotton in the Egyptian ointment if it is available, and if not, in salt water, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day, as it will consume what remains of the sac.	Then dip some cotton wool in Egyptian ointment if you have some; if not, in saline; and pack it in the wound and leave till next day, for that will destroy the remains of the capsule.	0.85315573
Then repeat the application of the cotton with the Egyptian ointment a second and third time, if needed, until you are certain that nothing of the sac remains.	Then repeat the cotton wool with Egyptian ointment a second time, or a third if need be, till it is certain there is nothing of the cyst left.	0.9236133
Then treat the wound with ointments until it heals.	Then treat the wound with ointments until healed.	0.9955337
And if the swelling contains a fatty mass, incise it in this manner. Make a cruciform incision and insert the hooks into the lips of the wound and peel it from every side. And exert your utmost effort in extracting the membrane that contains it.	If the tumour contains a fatty cyst, incise thus, a cruciform incision; then hook up the edges of the incision, dissect away every direction, and strive to extract the containing capsule.	0.7861334
If an artery obstructs you, do what I described to you later, and do the same for the swelling if it is hardened from the incision, and the treatment is the same as I mentioned.	If you should come across an artery, deal with it in the manner already described. Carry out the same manner of incision and treatment for a stony tumour, just as I have described.	0.7890723
The incision on the hardened swelling is easier because it has little blood and moisture, and some of these swellings that are in the head in some people may have no moisture at all, and that is because I incised a swelling in the head of an old woman, and I found the swelling like a hard, rough, white stone, I could not break it, and if someone threw it, it would injure him.	It is easier to open a hard tumour, for it has little blood and humidity; and sometimes these tumours on some people's heads have no humidity at all. I myself cut down upon a tumour in the head of an elderly woman and I found the tumour as hard as a stone, rough and white, which it was impossible to break, and which if thrown at anyone would have injured him.	0.8832298
And what was of the other swellings occurring in the head other than this, such as the swellings that appear in the heads of children and at the bases of the ears, incise them all with a simple incision and make its bottom from its lower part to facilitate the flow of the material to the bottom, then treat it with what is appropriate for it of treatment.	For all tumours arising in the head other than these, such as those which occur in children's heads and those at the root of the ear, make a simple incision. You should always begin your incision from below to allow an easy downward flow for the pus. Then treat with suitable after-treatment.	0.80135226
