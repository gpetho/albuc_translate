Praefatio.	 Praiseworthy introduction
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	 Having finished explaining this book to you, my sons, and having come to the end of it after considering its contents along with all its explanations, I have decided that I will now read aloud to you the part about surgery itself—that is, the art of performing operations or surgeries using your hands.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	 Because the art of performing operations has been covered by hand in our region and time period as well, I will now explain to you its rules regarding surgical instruments—that is, the specific tools used for performing surgeries with their own explanations.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	 However, in our current time period and given the length of medical training required for an artifex to become proficient at surgery, I must explain that the surgeon needs to study anatomy first—that is, Galen's explanation of it before studying how each member of the body functions with its own explanations.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	 And according to Hippocrates, the name is closely related to the work performed and should be more about the performance than the theory behind it.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	 Now I have already explained this book's introduction to you.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	 Since the one who did not know what I said about anatomy cannot correct himself by merely reading it without knowing it or experimenting with it, just like many others before him who were training in this field and were ignorant of its theory but had no experience to speak of.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	 It is because I saw a woman with a stiff neck as if she were a horse and it pierced arteries on her neck—causing blood to flow out of the women until death took hold of his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	 A physician amputated another, who surpassed him in extracting a stone from urine, and who had also processed it in his old age - the stone was great
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	 Therefore he turned to him (the other physician) and extracted him with the help of a bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	 Because he died on the third day
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	 And I too had already turned to him for extraction - and because of the greatness of the stones, and from the infirmity of an attendant, it seemed that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	 Another physician was at the time of a man who possessed his own land and practiced medicine - he fell upon him suddenly with a blow that fractured in his thigh near his ankle: and the attendant physician treated him unaware, tied up the fracture on top of a mule with ropes and stakes, and set about with strong iron bars to strengthen it so as not to release his breath.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	 So he let go of him according to his wish.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	 Afterwards he released him in several days and told him not to let go of the strap - and remained so until his leg was healed completely, and its weight, and led towards death.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	 I therefore turned to him - and helped him to undo the strap. And tranquility returned, and he was relieved from his pain.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	 However, corruption had already been confirmed in the leg - I could not prevent it any longer.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	 Therefore, the corruption stopped from spreading to another part of his body and died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	 And I too had a physician who cut through the cancerous abscess - an ulceration occurred after several days until his malice with its master was great.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	 Which is because when the cancer is pure from melancholy humor then it must not be treated with iron everywhere unless there is a member that can tolerate it so that all of it may be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	 And because of this, O sons of healing, it is necessary for you to know that the treatment must be done with two divisions - namely by associating the health and the division from which there was danger in many ways.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	 I have read through this entire book from beginning to end, where it contains an operation that is described with both fear and trembling
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	 For you need to read it carefully so that you understand it clearly and distinguish its parts; otherwise there will be a risk of misinterpreting the meaning or confusing yourself while reading it aloud.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	 So then, with great care and respect for the text, and assistance to the weak from both inside and outside of them, you will obtain a more effective path towards grace and good health which leads to salvation and a praiseworthy succession; and let go of terrible terrors that are difficult to endure. And may you release the burden of fear on yourself so that it falls off by itself into faith and comfort for yourselves.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	 But then remaining as a glory to you (personified) on this earth more so than before, and finally becoming higher among all things; and after that towards the extent of your own possessions.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	 Galen has already spoken about certain matters with advice.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	 Do not treat your burden as a disease, but rather call yourself the doctor of your own self.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	 And I have divided this Treatise according to three chapters
Capitulum primum.	 The first chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	 The first chapter is about caution when using fire and sharp medicines; the second one is about acute medicine of cautery with instruments up to the feet, forms as well as tools for cautery; including all that is necessary in operations.
Capitulum secundum.	 The second chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	 The second chapter is about incision and perforation; bleeding and vomiting; ulcers; extraction of arrows and others like them; all that pertains to it; the forms of instruments ordered up to their heads.
Capitulum tertium.	 The third chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	 The third chapter is about restoration and dislocation; the correction of twists and bends, and others like them; all that pertains to it; the forms of instruments ordered up to their feet, and as well as the tools themselves.
Soli Deo Gloria.	 To God be the glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	 The surgeon's book by Albucasis.
Pars I.	 Chapter One
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	 On Bleeding and Wound Dressing; about which he says what causes bleeding, when to use iron or gold
Caput I.	 The First Head
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	 And before the beginning of an operation with him, it is necessary to mention the quality of the cuts he made and how to dress wounds, showing this through his complexion.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	 Therefore I will speak about the quality of a dressing for wounds and how to dress them, because this is a complex matter with many nuances and subtleties that only someone who understands it can explain properly.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	 And having spoken of this matter many times before with the knowledge and understanding that is needed to do so, people have disagreed among themselves; however for me, I am content with only a few things from their words because of my fear of going on too long.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	 Therefore I will speak about the universal type of dressing that is used for all wounds, regardless of whether there is a wound or no wound; excepting only two types: one where the dressings are cold and without any materials to use them with, and another one where they are dry and without any materials.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	 However for the dressing in a hot or dry complexion that disagreed among themselves.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	 Some people said that this type of dressing is appropriate in such cases.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	 Others said the opposite of this and that this dressing is not suitable for burns which are a result of heat or dryness; because the nature of fire is to be hot, therefore when one's body is burned by both heat and dryness he cannot recover with cold dressings as well as dry ones but only with heated and dried.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	 And he who said the opposite of this said that by using this dressing for all cases where it was caused by heat and dryness which affect people's bodies; because when you compare a person's body to its humidity and look at its complexion as if it were fire, the result would be cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	 And I say through his words because of my own experiences in this matter.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	 "However, it is not advisable to enter into this matter unless you have already been trained and practiced the final course of surgery mentioned above, and have acquired knowledge about men's complexions, disposition towards wealth, causes of their accidents, and intervals of time.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	 "There is no fear on the part of other complexions except those with regard to coldness and humidity.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	 "All physicians have come together regarding these matters, but they did not agree on the subject of Cautery being applied to them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	 "The son of a physician understands from the secret care using Cautery with fire and its application over Cautery while burning medicine. Because fire is simple in action, whose effect only occurs to cauterize the part you want: but it does not hurt another member when it's applied together unless there's more pain.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	 "The action of physicians towards cauterizing is directed at this part which extends from the body and perhaps makes it difficult to heal wounds within that member and perhaps cuts off.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	 "Fire due to its subtlety and excellence of substance does not do this unless it's excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	 "We did not understand this through experimentation due to the length of utility and study with art, and post at the top position above the virtue of things; and for that reason, he was excused from giving a long speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	 "But if it were not for this book of mine, I would reveal to you the secret and hidden things about fire, which could remove the disposition towards coldness through speech by demonstrating with philosophy.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	 "The son of a physician understands that they disagree on the time when Cautery should be performed and suggest better times for you.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	 "And I tell you that Cautery should be performed at all times; because the injury which occurred due to time being submerged is washed away when applied with Cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	 "When cautery is used to relieve pain caused by necessary pains, with strength and in the presence of festivity; avoiding tardiness because one fears greater harm than that which comes from a delay.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	 "Do not let it enter your mind o sons of men; for unless you understand and remember that a cautery is only given by physicians and their apprentices when the pain being treated has been caused through heat: because once cautery has been used to heal, it cannot be undone always. And after having given it they should proceed and see if indeed it works as expected, otherwise do not expect too much from it.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	 "However, it is also necessary for the cautery to be used together with medicine and its strength, and that of its application; as well as the authority of the master himself: so that there may come a time when its power will be restored after some period according to the condition of the apprentice, or his location, and his own strength. And it is also possible for what has been prepared in him from excess of fluids, which have come into being within him; as well as for what came to him through them, and others like them from their cause - unless its power comes from it.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	 "The small pain of the many fluids and humors is like the cautery on teeth for relieving pain; it's possible then that he does not suffer from this same pain.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	 "However, this happens only rarely.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	 "Another speech is to be made after a cautery has been applied for the last time; this one should follow and clarify that which they intended in him: because they believe it was not a treatment that accompanied medicine nor another done afterwards by a cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	 "However it is contrary to that which they intended and the idea of a cautery being after last medicine: unless when we administer in the ways of treatment some of its own healing power; then later on, after the cautery has been given for all, there comes an end with it.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	 "The ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; they did not say this because of the equality in price or the splendor of their material; but they said it was a better place for cautery.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	 However, this is not absolutely true because I have tried it and found that it does not work on certain bodies without working on others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	 Cautery with him was better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	 However, when you apply the cauterization with fire to gold, it is not attributed to you, when applying according to quantity than iron because of the brilliance of gold; and when applied on him frostbite, if added above ignition, it will be extinguished by fire, and burned in a mat.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	 Therefore the practitioner was occupied with this for work; and because of it fit cautery with iron near to us or closer place due to rectitude towards the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	 I myself had ordered this chapter on cautery according to the chapters; and ordered them from the head up to the feet so that those who want it could get what they want out of it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	 How to cauterize the head at the coronal suture
Caput II.	 The second chapter is about cauterizing the head from the coronal suture downward.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	 This cautery affects the control of moisture and coldness above the brain; which two are the causes, and the flow of humor from head to parts of eyes and ears, and sleep, and pain in teeth, and in throat: and universally all kinds of weakness caused by coldness, such as paralysis, sodae, epilepsy, apoplexy, and others similar.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	 The mode of cauterization is such that you should first apply it with an effective solution to the head for three nights or four depending on how much strength and youthfulness and his custom requires.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	 "Then apply a bandage around his head with a turban.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	 Then place him on your lap while you support his body between your hands in the same manner as before when he placed his hand over his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	 "Then place his head on top of one arm with its elbow supported by the other.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	 "As a result of this he will be able to use both hands for signing gestures.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	 Then apply the olive oil cautery which has that shape.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	 "Then place him on a marked spot with his right hand free to descend and be gently pulled up by your hand.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	 "Then lift or lower the body according to need while grasping the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	 "If you now wish him to remove his head from the elbow or to lower it onto your forearm.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	 "Otherwise use a stick for support or another implement as needed until the bones are loosened.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 "Then apply something from a vessel and wash him with water; after that drink his own vomit to avoid the risk of poisoning or death.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	 "Then place a bandage soaked in olive oil over him and remove it from above when the charcoal is consumed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	 "In that case use unguent with four philters to heal him.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	 They say it is better and more effective for the pus to escape if there's a larger opening because pus needs space.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	 "Some said that cautery should be applied to the skin up to the nose and it held in place with a cautery until the flesh was seared.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	 "After this application you will treat him as before.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	 "Others say that it is necessary to cauterize with a caustic substance until the impression of the wound is made in his nose and then he falls or dies as if by a knife: or use an instrument shaped like an alphabet that women carry, which they apply to the affected part, so that the blood escapes from this place in great quantities.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	 In order for it to be cured, until it is consolidated
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	 I do not recognize the two species of Cautery except among certain people according to their fear
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	 It is better for me with this [Cautery] when they are healthy.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	 The head becomes weak due to the continuous solution of its natural state. Similarly, we have tested it on other members and especially when the head is naturally weak; therefore, Cautery species are more effective for healing and better than others, and they should be used with caution in order to operate with them in a healthy condition.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	 Cautery of the head is done for pain throughout the whole head
Caput III.	 Head IV.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	 When a chronic pain throughout the entire head occurs and it is prolonged by an illness, and you use remedies with care for them [the sick], as well as for your wife or other relatives [who are ill].
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	 And especially if Cautery has already been done with one Cautery species that we have mentioned and nothing else is applied to it at this time, consider
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	 If the head is naturally strong and not weak, but it has become cold due to external factors; then Cautery with another Cautery species should be done for it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	 After Cautery has been done on every hair of the head's Cautery species, it should not penetrate through the skin and expose the quantity as we have mentioned
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	 Cautery should be done on one Cautery species at the place that is called "yours" and it is a location where you put your hand in this case; keep your mouth closed (not to expose it).
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	 The sick person became ill due to this chronic pain and different from the Cautery of all heads' pains.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	 And I say that Cautery should be done at this place and it is a Cautery species that should Cautery the hair of the head's Cautery and Cautery lightly its location on the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	 This is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	 Cautery may be used for headaches both with or without medication.
Caput IIII.	 Section 2
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	 When the head hurts on one side, or extends to the eye and is relieved with medicines moistening it, and further care is administered, as I described in the divisions of medicine, without adding that which was done completely: then cautery is applied according to two ways: either with an acute burning medicine, or with a hot iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	 Cautery with an acute burning medicine is as follows: apply one tooth to each side of it, and ignite both sides by fire, and remove the extremities from its two ends.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	 Then bind the place where the pain is with a ligature on one side only until it makes into that place under the knife, so that the nose may be cut there.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Therefore bind him there under the knife until it is hidden: then tie a knot on top of him with a good cord and let go after twelve hours or three days depending on how much he needs, and take out that which was left over from two or three days. Afterwards, put on top of him a piece submerged in butter until the place becomes pus-like: afterwards care for it with unguent to heal completely.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	 And if you want this done using some burning medicines as I described them in the twelfth book about medicine for doctors.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	 Cautery on him with an iron is according to that method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	 The cautery, whose shape this is
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	 It is called Claudian because its form of the head is like that of a claw, where there is some quality and importance.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	 Then put him over the place and hold your hand tightly: quickly take iron from one side with haste until you have removed as much as is in the skin according to its thickness as I described earlier.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 "Take your hand and place it gently upon the artery below which is lower; if there is any flow of blood.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Afterwards, apply the same hand to salt water and place it on the spot where you have applied it before; let it remain there for three days. Then apply your hand with butter again; after that, treat it with unguent until it is completely healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	 And if the eye, burn this artery gently and carefully using the second fire of Cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	 If an incision is made into that artery within this eye, do not use a different kind of cautery.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	 By the use of Cautery on the other side
Caput V.	 The head V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	 When you are treating the eye and have done what we described in the preceding care (and that which we mentioned regarding incisions), and not performed healing: And see if there is no relief due to it; because as a result of Cautery with medicine, or with fire, then let him use Cautery's cautery until all pain signs over the place are gone, whose length is equal to the middle finger, or rather that one. Then remove your hand gently, and keep it until you cut the artery close to the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	 However, it is necessary for you to place the hand on the side of the jaw which moves towards chewing so that its length does not extend too far away and may not cause a spasm; or if both move equally, then it must be as before.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	 This is on the safety and caution regarding the artery that was cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	 For to him it is fear and especially if he did not know what was done there and was not diligent or knowledgeable; and let the operation be given with him first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	 And I will describe how blood flow occurs from the artery according to its own mode and at that place of this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 If you see from Cautery that it is not enough to him for this, and if you see the body soft for Cautery on the middle of the head as we described, let healing occur until he is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	 "If one has a Cauterion (a type of probe used for cautery) and is administering it to extract an artery with two hooks.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	 The cauterization here mentioned is better than the previous kind, as more effective.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	 By means of cautery for the pain treatment.
Caput VI.	 Head sixth
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	 When there is pain due to frost and it stops with cold solution, the rest of the treatment as mentioned earlier, no more pain remains, then a fire Cauterion must be applied: this is called Point whose shape is like that one.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	 Afterwards the point being applied to it after its fire is extinguished all around the ear's whole circumference like before: or at both sides if simultaneously there is pain on both sides.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	 Afterwards you apply the Cauterion deeper at the root of the ear after using the wax: and there are ten points for cautery on all around the ear, almost as many.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	 Afterwards healing takes place until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	 By means of cautery for torture.
Caput VII.	 Head seventh
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	 Torture which is treated with cautery, unless it happens due to the types mentioned earlier from phlegm, as per what we said in the divisions of sweat.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	 With withdrawn cautery, which was caused by a spasm and shivering in the nerve?
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	 When you cure this kind of torture by the ear lobe, and gurgling in the throat, and if your treatment does not succeed: then it is necessary to apply Cauterion with three hooks at once: one at the root of the ear, another just below that, thirdly at the junction of two lobes.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	 Then apply your Cauterion from the opposite side weakly
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	 If no relief is obtained unless it appears healthy
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	 The form of Cautery is as follows: Cauterio should be applied to the upper part of the ear's extreme, under the earlobe, and another one at the time of the ear lobes.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	 Lay your hand gently upon it until it is burned away entirely
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	 This is the shape of cautery and its species derived from an instrument with a raised edge. However, it is not as subtle as you might expect; therefore, there should be excessive caution when applying the cautery to avoid burns on sensitive areas.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	 Afterwards, apply a cold compress over it until it has cooled off.

When Apoplexy is about to occur and the cure is applied with what we have spoken of, your treatment shall not come into play; furthermore, if he does not have a fever, then you must cauterize his head at four points on top of it, in the middle of the head as well, just like what was said before, and in the eye socket where necessary.

In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 When performing cautery with fire: prepare the instruments beforehand in order to remove his hairs if they protrude from them; otherwise they will be prolonged and equalized.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	 If the hairs are protruding on his own part of the body: then hold his eyes tightly with a wet cloth so they won't move until they fall off.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	 Afterwards the head is placed into your hand; then you apply a mixture of wax and pitch to the palpebrae of his eyes according to their shape; and it is done as per the figure of leaves, being the beginning that signifies near the hairs.

Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Afterwards you perform cautery using fire for this purpose.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	 "Then cauterize over the figure that you have just made a small number of burns on many parts, until the surface of the skin has been completely burned, like the appearance of a leaf that is dead.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	 "Your medical work's sign is this: if you have already closed the eyelids with a finger, and hairs are plucked from around the eyehole.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Therefore use your hand at that time: throw it away for three days.

Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 "Then take care of it with oil until it is cured.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	 "If any hair remains after the time of anointing and softening the eyelid, then repeat cautery on that place as you did before.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	 "If hairs are found below the eyelid, then cauterize that one as well until it gets to its own place and becomes equal so that no hairs will get in the eye.

Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	 "Then take from soap and water knowledge, and from chalk not touched by any other weight of a single ounce or almost that one: then do with it in the same way as before but gently, until it is not violated.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	 "Then from the palm take what you have formed like leaf shape as before and put it over the eyelid of one or two.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	 "And then throw under the eye a knife soaked in albumin, and your head will become inflamed in its place.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	 "Then put over it an index finger on medicine and press it hard.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	 "And you will have pressed it as many times as the medical treatment is painful, because its bite was like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	 "Having cut off that which he himself inflicted injury unto, then does he release the medicine and embraces it with his own hand.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	 "When therefore cessation of the bite occurs, then remove the medicine and wipe away the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	 "And consider then, if you wish to wash the eye with a cloth as it is washed upon combustion or cutting; well done: and if not, then apply from the medicine above the place where she did not act, but do not smear, until finally, your operation is complete, and your eyes contract.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	 "Then put over this cotton with butter, until the skin burnings are removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	 "And then take care of him with a lotion or another, until he is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	 "You must also pay attention to the last guardian, so that nothing may fall from the medicine into your eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	 "But if the eye becomes swollen after days and you struggle for something to fall into your eye from the hair, then repeat the medicine over that place where she was soothing of the eye itself as in the beginning.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 "And take care of him until he is healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	 "And here are the shapes of death's leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	 "You know that the eyes of men vary greatly in size and shape.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	 Therefore you should consider it this way: And do not hide the path of rectitude for him who is intent on these arts.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	 "On how to cauterize a fistula weeping (teary) eye.
Caput XIX.	 "Chapter nineteen.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	 "When you cure a fistula as we explained previously and do not apply your care differently; then it is necessary that you cauterize her in this manner.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	 "Communicate to the weak so that he may place his head upon your arm and hold it by its hair, just as you would hold him, so that it does not move nor strike with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 "Then, you insert a needle with ink or mucilage into his eye, or put it onto the eyelid of that person; then burn an instrument shaped like this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	 "Place the cautery on a curved surface like that of an arrowhead or the upper part of one's hand; if it penetrates further and enters another extremity as well.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	 However, this cautery is better for your work (i.e., surgery).
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	 "Then take the fistula and extract it along with its sheath, or else open that one up as well; if not opened, then make an incision in it and extract from there.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	 "Then put the cautery on top of that, let it be ignited with fire.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	 "Hold on to your hand closer to the cautery at its eye level so that it doesn't get burned; and place it onto the eyelid of the patient or wipe it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	 "If you reach the cauterization tool up to his mouth, it will be good (i.e., successful).
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 "If not, repeat the cautery once or twice until you get that.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	 "Then put it with butter and smear it on with oil to heal him.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	 "If they haven't healed him within thirty days and he doesn't get better; then put something sharp, corrosive medicine on top of it to burn the mouth.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	 "There is another way for cautery on a fistula that some people mentioned first.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	 "Take aim at the opening of the fistula and find it; then put on a thin, narrow slit like that of a snail.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	 "And if you find it in the same amount as a drachma of liquid gold and keep your hand with good grasp on the snail-like slit, so that he doesn't get burned all over or fall into the eyes.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	 "It is necessary that you put above the eye an infusion of alum mixed with water, or else.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	 Lead may be used to cleanse a fistula and heal it marvelously.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	 If the fistula is healed as described by Cautio and Curatio (Cauteries), then this is beneficial.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	 And if not, then it must be administered into the nose and reduced to follow through the nasal passage as far as is possible within its own place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	 Cautery for wounds of the lips.
Caput XX.	 The 20th part
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	 Many injuries occur on the lips or what are called pimples, and especially among children's lips.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	 Since you are to cure the wounds as described by Cautio and Curatio (Cauteries), then use a small ember to cauterize them in this manner.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	 And with the subtlety of your application.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	 Then place it ablaze on these wounds until you have seared through to their depths.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	 After which has been seared with the fire, cure that wound.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	 Cautery for wounds of the mouth.
Caput XXI.	 The 21st part.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	 When a blister appears at the root of the gums or on the palate or in the roots of teeth, then it produces pus and becomes inflamed: afterwards it heals, runs, and forms a fistula; after that cure is applied to it, without conferring treatment upon it elsewhere, it must be seared by a small ember placed into the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	 After that you place it the small ember into the fistula, holding your hand tight and keeping close to its body until it reaches the very bottom of this, or do as many times as necessary using two hands.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	 After which has been seared with the fire, cure that wound as described in the manner of curing until completion
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	 And if it is healed and cured, then this is beneficial.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	 "If not, you must then cut open and remove the corrupt part of your nose.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	 For cauterizing the nostrils, and smoothing over the teeth
Caput XXII.	 Head 22
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 When the nostrils are smoothed out due to moisture and teeth removed with care along with cures that apply with medicines, do not forget: at this point you should place your head on a pillow in your own bed.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	 After the cautery is applied as described above (i.e., a stick was inserted into the nostril and lit on fire), you should then apply it to your tooth: put the heated cautery in, moving slowly so that the flame does not spread; meanwhile keep your hand close by until you feel the heat from the fire spreading up to the roots of the teeth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	 Then take hold with your other hand; thereafter apply the heated cautery repeatedly as before.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	 After this, you should loosen the patient's mouth and hold it open for a moment; then spit out what is in there.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	 The nostril remains stiff from drying out, so it should be smoothed over again and the moisture that has been corrupted dried up.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	 For cauterizing the teeth.
Caput XXIII.	 Head 23
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	 When the tooth pain is due to coldness or frostbite within it, or from frostbite on its surface and not cured with medicines: then apply the cautery in two ways: either a cautery with butter, or fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	 The cautery should be applied with butter to smear it onto the tooth surface and rub until frostbite is removed from the ear or nostril.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	 Afterwards take hold of it (the cautery) and press it against the tip of the tooth.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	 Afterwards smear the cautery with butter and apply it to the sore tooth, keeping hold of it until frostbite is removed from both sides; thereafter repeatedly apply it as before while avoiding heat reaching up to the roots of the teeth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	 "If you want to plunge the tongue into butter, or put it into cold butter and place it over a tooth that is hurting; then place hot iron on top of this so that heat may be applied deeply to the teeth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	 "However, when cautery is done with fire for removing air from a vein or for cutting off a vein.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	 "And it should be inside his body to prevent the heat of the iron from reaching into his mouth through the nostrils.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	 "Then cautery is done with a heated cautery; and place it on that tooth. And hold your hand tight until the cautery is finished.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	 "Do this at once or later with time; for if there's pain [it will] be removed right away or the next day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	 "And it's necessary to press on that cautery until his mouth is healed by the warmth of the tongue; and hold him tight for an hour.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	 "And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	 "Cauterize with whatever extremity you have, according to what's possible; and this is the shape of a vein or artery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	 "In the manner of cautery for veins in strophules.
Caput XXIIII.	 "Chapter 24.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	 "When the strophules are filled with phlegm and by cold humidity; and they don't obey digestion because of stiffness through muscles; then you cautery them on that day or in the next; whose shape is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	 "Having two open extremities to guide away the smoke from one extremity; and place hot iron on top of him right away. And if it doesn't work [on] that hand, then you repeat this until a deep burn occurs in both hands.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	 "If the cautery is too hot; then place the cautery according to the amount of pain in both hands.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	 "Then remove it from [the heat] for three days; and place over it cold butter until the pain is gone that was caused by fire.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	 "In order to cleanse [i.e., clean] the tooth with a scraper, ensure that the scraper is in its proper place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	 To cauterize (burn and stop bleeding) using a forceps, you must first restrain or clamp off the blood flow to prevent it from escaping while you perform the procedure.
Caput XXV.	 The 25th head
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	 When the patient sneezes into a tube going to their lungs and especially when that happens during cold weather, then it is necessary for the nurse first to clear the sputum with saline solution before performing any other treatment.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	 After cleaning the tooth with a scraper and ensuring it is in its proper place, cauterize (burn) the affected area of the throat, making sure to avoid burning or injuring nearby tissues unless absolutely necessary for the procedure.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	 After cleaning the tooth and ensuring it is properly positioned, you may proceed to cauterize (burn) with a second forceps at the junction of the collar bone towards the end, in order to apply a tourniquet if necessary after this procedure.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 After you have done everything before, ensure that it has been successfully completed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	 To cauterize (burn and stop bleeding) into the bronchi of the lungs or trachea, make sure to do so as well.
Caput XXVI.	 The 26th head
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	 When a patient has coughing and cold air affects the lungs but does not have fever or phlegm, and an ancient constriction is present (i.e., they are experiencing bronchitis), then you must cauterize them using two forceps above the Adam's apple in the throat's depressed areas, gently.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	 And to cauterize another one at the middle of the chest between two breast bones, make sure that you use a tourniquet as well after this procedure is complete.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	 If your piercing is done using a forceps that has already been used for another procedure called "Piercing," whose form precedes the piercing of the ear's pain, then there are 30 points before it and up to almost as many after it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 After you have done everything before, ensure that it has been successfully completed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	 And the tourniquet is having three coils at this point.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	 Cauterization after excision of a vein
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	 Cautery technique for the humerus dislocation
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 27
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	 When the head of the attendant is dislocated due to humidity and does not come back to its place during the period when it should have returned, then there must be a sudden movement for reducing the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	 After that he is carried on his back or over both sides.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	 Then you apply a tourniquet with your left hand inside the tourniquet, and if the dislocation occurs towards it.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	 With two cautery irons.
Cuius forma est haec.	 What is its shape?
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	 Then you cauterize the tourniquet until it penetrates all the way to one of the sides and does not have four irons with him.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	 And when sometimes three irons are used for cautery, then there will be six irons and they should be arranged according to the subtlety of the force applied.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	 This is the shape for those with three irons.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	 And sometimes an addition is made over this way one, then there are eight irons.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	 Then sprinkle some salt on top of the tourniquet with a sponge.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	 Then gently stretch the patient to keep them from moving at any time until they are comfortable.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	 If a dislocation occurs towards the top and it is rare to find this position, then cautery should be applied over the upper arm with an iron or many irons inserted through it.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	 The tourniquet is tightened and moisture is removed from it; and so the patient recovers.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	 Cautery technique for stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	 When cold and excessive humidity occur in the stomach until it is removed from its own skin; many catapults are added to it, along with other remedies for curing it; do not give up: then you carry him on his back, stretch out his arms and hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	 "Then cautery is performed with three different tweezers, the middle one being inserted into the ear canal up to its fingertips and the two others are used on either side of it for forming a triangular figure.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	 "And while they are trying to grip each other's fingers together when performing the cautery.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	 "The depth of the cautery is proportional to the third one in terms of its size.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	 "And the shape of the triangular figure formed is without any addition; and if one cautery performs it deeply within the middle part, this form follows; and a cautery whose depth equals that of the first one will have its shape as a circle according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	 "A cautery is performed with a point on the other's finger; and it is so that there is a mark above the stomach as far as the amount of encaustry. And if he performs it deeply within this form: after which, with an another cautery point, do the cautery itself, and then cure him with curing, until he recovers.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	 "In a way of performing cautery, one should be cold.
Caput XXIX.	 "Chapter XXIX.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	 "When it happens to the Epate with pain, coldness and humidity or a large amount of fatiness until its excess has exited through natural exit; then he cures the sick one by our method, and does not exceed this. Then let him be supported on his own back so that there is an interval between every cautery according to their size; and according to the length from the rectum of the body, and do not grasp too much with a cautery.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	 "And let his quantity which is being fed from the thickness of skin be proportional to the middle amount and not more; and let him stand on both feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	 "If he is not standing then a supplicant who has already stretched out his limbs and hands should be used.
Haec est forma cauterii.	 This is the shape of cautery
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	 Indeed it may be possible for you to use this cautery when performing surgery with caution and skill, for if your dexterity and prudence are present in the art of medicine
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	 Guard yourself so that you do not harm the skin or any other part of your body with this cautery, as its thinness makes it easy to burn through all flesh from top to bottom, causing severe burns and even death unless used carefully: for the skin there is great sensitivity, therefore know this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	 Cautery's method
Caput XXX.	 The head.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	 If the cautery is applied to the head or clothing of Ephasthenes and causes a severe pain without heat, it may be that there was some sort of damage in his skin before applying the cautery; if on the other hand, the cautery's pain comes from within the clothing itself.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	 Therefore let him take the patient to bed with her own pillow.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 Then apply a figure of the cautery, covered in wax, and wait for the heat from it to be absorbed into the flesh through radiation.
Et haec est forma eius.	 This is its shape
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	 Once the cautery is applied with him and burns all flesh until it dies, his pain will cease once his whole body has recovered; then he will be cured by treatment of wounds as required.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	 It is not necessary to use this form of cautery unless his study and expertise in the art of medicine is prolonged; or if it is the hand that has been accustomed for some time to those troubles with its own experimentations, then he should be allowed to practice surgery.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	 I prefer to let her go away from me.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	 Cautery's method in Plethon
Caput XXXI.	 The head.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	 The ancients used the cautery with the roots of Aristolochia for Plethon to freeze him by placing them in a cold manner on his head.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	 "And you shall receive from the roots of the common arum a long one, one that comes from it, and let its length be as great as your finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	 Then immerse her into oil; light her with fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	 Then cauterize one of the vessels between the neck and the head with a heated iron tool, and two others close beside each other on both sides to seal off the area below the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	 And two others as well in the vessel between the fifth and sixth ribs towards the back; another one into the middle of the chest, and another one above to the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	 And three others towards the back; one into the vessel between two spoons, and two others on both sides of the chest downwards, towards another that is between two spoons.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	 And it's not necessary for you to squeeze your hand with the iron as if it were a press; just let there be an odor from its touch.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	 Some others said that there are people who use the iron tool as a press; they burn and put it into the vessel between the sides until it is full to the top of each side, then the oil runs out, just like we described for the oil lamps of Epatis.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	 However with this perforation there is a risk that either the sick person will die quickly or it may cause an injury to the wound which was not treated properly.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	 The method of cauterizing the head of Splenius, which is the last.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	 When you are curing a cold with the method we described from the treatment of fever and chills, and your care is not complete, then cautery should be performed according to three methods which all are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	 One is to perform three cauteries or four straight ones along the length of the spleen according to the figure of the irons used by Epatis, which comes first in their order.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	 And let the quantity of every cautery be as great as your finger or less than that.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	 "Let the mode of cutting be as equal as that of shaving.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	 Do not compress your hand with the knife; and let it remain raised above its back when healing is complete.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	 The other mode for cauterization is as follows: If one holding a cautery has two handles, we mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the arm; and pull out the wound towards the spleen, where the finger had been injured to the left side; and let you let go it according to its length so that both cauteries fall down according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	 Then insert two ignited handles into the wound until one of them penetrates to the other side; then remove the cautery and there will be four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	 If you are cauterizing with a different kind of cautery, holding three handles.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	 After the removal of this cautery emit a large number of cauteries during several days; for it is more effective than any remaining from previous care.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	 The mode of cauterization in Hydropis.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	 Cautery does not fall in Hydropis, unless it is one's own.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	 When you cure Hydropis with the mode of care we mentioned for division and without correction, then it should be that cauteries are placed on the navel fourfold; one above the belly, another over the epa, another over the spleen, two post the back between the shoulders, one into the chest, another into the stomach. And let the depth of the cautery be closely related to the depth of the wound.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	 Then remove an open cautery so that it emits pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	 And after the cautery do not treat an injured one with that same care; it should be done so that two intentions are gathered to him: and he will recover with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	 The form of the cautery with which it is cauterized in the belly should be sharp; and according to what precedes its shape for him. And that one with whom it was cauterized on his back should have a large size, according to what preceded its shape for him.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	 Cauterizing the Feet and Fingers
Caput XXXIIII.	 Head
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	 When the head is immersed in heated water and soaked with red wine vinegar, a cautery should be applied to the soles of the feet, between the ear and nose; use your thumb as a cautery, but do not pull it out until you have tested its effect on both hands: after that test its action again by withdrawing one hand from contact.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	 The vinegar will soften the cautery in accordance with this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	 After this, apply two cauteries to each foot and use both thumbs for that purpose; fix a cautery between the knee and the calf, going around it halfway up the leg; above all apply two cauteries in one line on either side of the thigh: remove the open cautery without delay, so that something from water may be applied or tested by it. After that, cure him with what we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	 Cauterizing the Feet Solution
Caput XXXV.	 Head
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	 When the solution is taken from cold and dampness, until the retentive and digestive powers are weakened and exhausted; which are in stomach and intestines: cure him with the method of curing, but do not heal or restore health to him; test his toleration by a generous cautery that excites the powers, then apply the cautery large on his belly according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, four cauteries in the subtle circumflexes with a small, sharp one: and also use two cauteries above the ears and above the eyebrows with a big one.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	 If you find excessive dampness and weakness in him, then apply a cautery to his cheek as well; also use two smaller ones above the belly near its top part.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	 The cure is efficient, without any error.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	 Cauterizing the Haemorrhoids
Caput XXXVI.	 The sixty-sixth head
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	 When hemorrhoids occur on an old head (caput), or one, and they arise from excessive heat, coldness, humidity, or corruption of moisture; then they should be treated as described in the previous section, with cautery. Cauterize three times at the inferior angle below the breastbone, using a small flame, like two fingers; and cauterize under the belly button just with two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if you think that his stomach is cold and he cannot eat or swallow, then cauterize him with a large flame above the stomach; as before mentioned. Cauterize over his anus also, and one over his spleen, using a small flame for each, after which, release the cautery immediately: thereafter provide treatment, until he recovers
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	 The method of cauterizing after making an incision in hemorrhoids
Caput XXXVII.	 The seventy-second head
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 When you have made a cut to the head (caput), then apply fire to the cautery
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	 Then introduce the ignited cautery into the cut itself; and finally your hand, until the blood flows out through a new opening; either one time, or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	 If there are many hemorrhoids then cauterize each one with the method that we described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	 Then provide treatment to them as previously mentioned, until they heal.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 If you cauterize him with a large flame over the anus, it is more likely that the last will be through urination.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	 The method of cauterizing Fistula in the Anore
Caput XXXVIII.	 The eighty-eighth head
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	 When the section and operation that we described were not enough to heal him at his own place, then he should be cauterized with fire.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	 Because the fistula occurred and became old, there was bleeding from it, and humidity corrupted it.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	 Dignifiedly, what needs to be done is that you attempt gently.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	 Next, determine the depth of penetration required for it.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	 Afterwards, apply a cautery similar to that used in surgery.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	 Afterwards, introduce yourself into the fistula and measure the depth at which you entered it.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And then repeat with another cautery until all the corrupted bodies are cleared away; once, twice or three times, depending on how deep you entered.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	 And hold you back from the sharp edge of the knife if there is one; or lead a fistula into contact with a female body part, then into contact with an intestinal body part - at this point, hold you back in these places all around.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	 Do not do that unless the fistula is located on a body part that can be penetrated; and think carefully because it cannot penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	 Afterwards, heal the area as much as possible.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	 If the place is sealed off and materials are removed from it; then remember that this has taken a long time to heal - at this point you know that he is now completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And if materials are not removed from it; at this point you know that he is penetrating either into a corrupted part of his mouth or nearly so - the memory will return to its own place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	 In order for cautery
Caput XXXIX.	 The 39th head
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 When it happens to Renes that pain is caused by frost or great cold and the cause thereof was due to a sick coius; at this point one must cauterize him above the heads of the Renes, with a cautery over all the Renes itself, over each Rene with a similar cautery, whose memory remains.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	 And perhaps we should cauterize him again at his own request.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	 What follows three lines
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	 Therefore, the remainder of this writing is complete.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	 In order for cautery
Caput XL.	 "Head (skull)
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	 When an injury occurs in the bladder area, there is a softening of the scrotum and its moisture, until it does not retain urine; then cauterize it near the top part of the penis (right side) with fire, or if unable to do so using two cauteries on either side.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	 Mode for Cauterizing the Scrotum
Caput XLI.	 "Head (skull)" of the 41st
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	 When an injury occurs to the bladder area and moisture is prohibited due to this, and the semen of his penis are corrupted, and delayed ejaculation occurs; it should be cauterized with two fire irons near its belly button, as mentioned in the manner for cauterizing the vesica, but near the lower back, or by using two cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	 Mode for Cauterizing the Anches (testicles)
Caput XLII.	 "Head" of the 42nd
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	 When the moisture of the mucosa of the Anchae occurs and causes death to him at his place; its sign is that it is stretched over one another when they are pressed together: and the site of dislocations is where there was a fire in this case.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	 Therefore it is recommended that he cauterize the infirm man over the mucosa of the Anchae with a similar circle; after which you should put its sign together with wax near the center of the circle, as mentioned earlier.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	 The mode for Cauterizing the Stomach
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	 If you do not have this cautery present at the time of injury, then cauterize it with three fire irons and a very large one; make its depth proportional to the extent of wounds on his body as a whole.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 After that cure him until he is healed
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	 Cautery for sciatica
Caput XLIII.	 Skull 33
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	 When the pain occurs due to a cold in the head and there are causes of its chilliness and humidity; then care is needed for this.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	 Therefore, cautery him/it
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	 The mode of cautery is according to two ways: either with medicines or fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	 Cautery with fire is done in many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	 One method is to cauterize the three cuts on the skull above the eye in this manner.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	 And let them have a good or bad depth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	 And there is space which is between every cautery and its size in digits; also cautery with oil.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	 When a cautery occurs in the middle over the head of him/her.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	 There are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	 If you cautery with a circle whose shape is that of the displacement of the cuts above, one method would be to have it enclose all the anchors together.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	 And remove the sharpness from all the skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	 This is how to cautery for sciatica when the pain occurs at the anchor and does not extend until it reaches the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	 If the pain extends until the hip and leg then you cautery on top of the hip above where he/she sat; also a fourth cautery on top of the thigh with four fingers, that way it is done
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	 The depth of cautery depends upon the sharpness of the skin cuts.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	 If the pain extends until nearly to the fingers of both feet then you should cautery at that place where he sat with a cautery point or three points; if four is needed then you do it with four or more.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	 "If a pain occurs beneath the knee joint and extends upwards towards the thigh, then cauterize it with one cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	 For all your cauterizations: so that you do not use a single cautery at the end to burn through veins or arteries and treat any bad swelling or constriction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	 I have heard of one and many others who cauterized above the knee joint and at the end of their cautery it swelled up and a tumor came from the foot to the whole body was perforated, and death followed shortly after.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	 If there is pain in both parts at once, then cauterize each according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	 Some wise men said that the method of this cautery was for burning hooks.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	 Make it similar to a hook with the middle of its palm width; and in its own hole place this third one according to the length of its fingers, or smaller if needed; insert it into that hole next to the second one.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	 And have space between every hook according to the number of fingers; let each one open on both sides as if it is a finger; and make them stronger with a steel hand on top.
Et haec est forma eius.	 This is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	 It is then burned by fire until it is red and emits flashes; afterwards it was placed on top of a hook that had been made weak to support the healthy limb.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	 Therefore, cauterize him with three round hooks into one cut at once.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Afterwards remove it for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	 After this, smear the wound with butter and remove it after several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Afterwards care for him with ointment until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	 Albucasis finished; thus are the sons of hookers used for this type of cautery out of fear and because very few were expected to come upon him.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	 Certainly is from good cuts for him who suffered and found a place with him.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	 Cauterizing tools when used with medical utensils are beneficial for cutting through an armor and reaching the heart's door, either by air or fire (smoke from burning), length of walls is required (for piercing). Two nodes in height are needed for this action, two knots as well.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	 And the space between the two amounts of body digits is opened, and it should be below and above as well (the action continues). And they should bind themselves according to this shape.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	 Then place the cauterizing tool on the anchor of the arrowhead, then gently bring it across a long straight line (the path).
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	 And grasp your hand firmly onto the anchor of the arrowhead very much.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	 Then find between two circles from a heated water which is heated with fire and holds the quantity of hours and times: and allows for the infirm's taking away his bite and his burning himself as it does with fire until the biting stops.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 Then take your hand with the instrument and remove hot water from its whole around completely with sweet water: then put it aside for two days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	 And put on top of that butter until the soot removal is done: then put it aside for days and continue from its flow.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	 This is the ultimate in burning (lit: "last" or "final").
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 And then cure it with ointments until it heals
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	 If the pain extends to the knee or leg, then fix him into it what you bound with water according to that which you did on the anchor equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	 And this is a method of hot water: and I have written about it in the medical treatise for the correction (lit: "rectification" or "correction").
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	 Take away the alkali and burned parts of both arms one at a time; then put it into two new bowls whose lower part is perforated with one hole (lit: "hole") according to how much you are going to feed him your radius, and place another bowl under the other arm as well. And pour over the alkali and ashes from hot water that submerges each of them separately by hand; after which you compress it tightly with both hands, then put aside the bowls until the sharp water from below descends into the other bowl.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	 Then collect this water entirely and pour it over another bone; then rinse
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	 That is to say, the heat of cautery (or searing hot water) applied at that time would be useful or beneficial for administering medicine and in the process of closing up wounds/membranes.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	 Because it accomplishes operations with fire itself
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	 And for medicines there are, with which large cauteries can be used and as mentioned before when using them in combination with wine or vinegar along with the salt, so that both may be mixed equally.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	 And Galenos indeed reported, from whose treatment certain men have obtained relief for the pain of anchalasia and sciatica; he praised him highly because of this.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	 He said so because he did not need another treatment and had become healthy from a single application of the ointment, until it was necessary to bring him back as long as that ointment itself had been applied within.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	 And it is so that the ointment of seerag may be taken as a remedy; and if this does not work with a remedy, then dry treatment must be applied instead; and it should be rubbed in quantity for three hours or until three times the amount that sedates when exposed to fire.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	 Then pour him into the ointment.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	 And then he becomes very sick and is brought to a bed or couch.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	 The pain had passed away, and he recovered.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	 And remember that one must not use fire with these medicines unless after the body has been washed or cleansed.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	 And Dioscurides said that the goat's head when it was burned with one sciatica brought relief; and it became a remedy of this kind.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	 Wool is applied to him and the ancient oil is poured over a deep place between his fingers and toes; it is very close to fire and can easily catch fire.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	 Take a thorn from a goat and heat it over fire until it becomes charcoal
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	 Put the heated thorn on a bed (lanum means 'bed' in Latin), then remove it, so that it goes out
Deinde itera illud.	 Repeat this process
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	 Don't stop until the sense (of pain) has reached its peak and settled into a bed of peace, at which point it will subside (from pain).
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	 And this mode is called cautery, or the Vaccine Way
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	 Pain from Dorsy.
Caput XLIIII.	 The skull has 44 segments
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	 When pain is caused by multiple causes or accidently, due to blows or from pushing out fluid and air, or through the means of evacuation, it occurs with the same effect as when there's a cold infusion into the body; but cautery itself does not occur unless only in this way, which happens after a cold infusion.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	 Therefore after evacuating with foetal pills and they are the same way to do so on Dorsy when pain is present, three lines in length following the breadth of the alleviation thereof, after signs have been done by a caustic all around the fifth line of cautery or more than one second according to their amount which was given from the allowance of the infirmity virtue of theirs. And let cauterization be made with cauterie points.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	 If you're using three cauteries or four with a middle one, then in this way (form).
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	 The mode of cautery to be done when the bleeding stops.
Caput XLV.	 The skull has 45 segments
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	 Many times do this trick fail with infants.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	 The sign of the bleeding is on infants; when it happens above them by a constriction while being carried away and moving; and finally in them at the last spine of Dorsy and their nodes, which have already begun to rise up over the remaining spines.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	 Now that you know this, and want to do it yourself: at that point cautery is done with a circle around in the same way as before.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	 "All veins should be cauterized equally and if you are cauterizing the vein of the hand then two lines or three.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	 After curing it [the patient], until he is cured with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	 And avoid administering the cautery to a trembling vein that may cause a spasm of the nerves.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	 Cauterize with caution and join the veins while dealing with Podagra.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter 66
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	 When the pains from cold and dampness occur to any part of the body causing it, when they strike the feet by custom is called Podagra.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	 With this cure for cold and damp causes of Podagra with care in the application so that they are no longer felt.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	 And it is, to cauterize him after the evacuation of veins on both feet with many cauteries and sit on the foot cautery.
Cuius haec est forma.	 Which is this form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	 And if you are unable to make the points on your face then do with the cautery as the dots.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	 If the pains rise up until the knees or the other veins and it has happened many times then cauterize him on all three of the legs with that cautery or four across all parts using this same cautery of Claudius.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 If you need more than one cautery then do so.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	 And not to plunge your hand with the cautery as much as skin is thin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	 If they rise up until the knees and the back then administer what we have said by the cautery on his head.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	 If they are only felt in your hands then you make points on both sides of the veins as two lines do if they come back to two lines again.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	 If there is remaining from the pains in your digits then make points on both sides of them over all the fingers and above the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	 If pain rises up after three days and goes to the shoulders, then cauterize both of them from every part
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	 And do not apply any medicine or remedy if you are in good health or have taken a doctor's prescription
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	 If the body is well and it is appropriate to follow a treatment program, then purge the phlegm with the help of God using the cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	 In order for cauterization to work on cuts
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter 70.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	 When a rupture occurs in the genitals and descends into the intestines or towards the scrotum, it is near to completion: then you must stop feeding your patient for one day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	 And if by chance the stone has descended within itself (i.e., is in an internal location), it should be loosened with gentle measures.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	 After that, put it on your chest and urge him to hold onto his desire until he has passed or the stone appears in the intestines.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	 After that, reduce it with your fingers and apply the cautery over the nostrils using a sign similar to the one used for opening the ears. The sign should be placed so its extremity is towards the top of the body (i.e., towards the head).
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	 After that, apply a hot iron cautery which has this shape until it comes out and burns through to the brain (i.e., towards the front of the head).
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	 After that, reduce the intestines or scrotum towards your feet.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	 After that, put your hand on the place and do not let the intestines go out: you have already opened between the fingers of the patient, and placed a pulse beneath him, while another is above his fingers who holds the other hand.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	 After that, apply the cautery over this sign with your right hand in its proper position (i.e., straight up).
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	 And hold onto him until he is accompanied by other signs or liquids which do not come from the cautery itself (i.e., they are unrelated).
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	 "When you observe the exit of the intestine during a cautery procedure, do not touch it; instead, let someone else perform this task on the weak or dying, so as to avoid great harm.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	 "You should know that when you cannot cooperate with a cautery procedure, do not perform your own operation.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	 "The cautery for infants should be as delicate as possible, according to the size of their bodies.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	 "Then care with other ointments until it is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	 "The weak or dying person should lie on their back for forty days, so that the ulcer will heal.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	 "You should provide food to him in proportion to the duration of his care, so that he will not vomit during meals or after eating.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	 "Then wait forty days before administering a ligature to him; and he should be held for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	 "The time of work will decrease, and the fullness of food and drink, as well as the ease of urination and defecation will increase.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	 "When this treatment is given, so too healing by complete cleansing occurs.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	 "I will discuss the cure for ruptures when I insert it into its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	 "However, when ruptures occur in the rest of the body and are just beginning to be visible, do not add more; then burn the ruptures with a wide ligature as before according to their size; thus that which is burned from now on will be like an additional part for him.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	 "Then care of this type [for ruptures] with what we said earlier: do not add to it.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	 "Some people suggested that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular ligature, in this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	 "After signing it [the rupture] with the wax, a line is placed that stretches from the upper side of the rupture to the lower side.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	 "Then place your hand between the ligature and the wound.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	 The first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	 For cauterizing due to a wound or shock.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter 80
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	 When it happens to some members due to injury or shock, and persists for a long time causing pain, then medical treatment must be sought; at that point an incision should be made with a sharp instrument
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	 The cautery should be applied to all members in proportion to its power and suitability, and weakness, disability, strength, flexion of the torso, and pain caused by it
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	 If healing occurs through the first cauterization is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	 If not, then try another one on top of it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	 Since the custom is to change from member to member according to their pain.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Therefore, let them be treated with the cautery until they are cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	 For cauterizing in Leprosy
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter 89
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	 Leprosy sometimes requires maximum effort for cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	 Especially the type of Leprosy that occurs due to the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy; take into account when cautering it.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	 If Leprosy is incurable and you treated it with him without success, as we mentioned before in the division; then do not descend or remain unchanged: but times upon the infirmity that comprehends the corruption of his entire complexion, then cauterize him on top of five cauteries: one to the middle of the head near by noting, and second below over his forehead at the end of hairs, and two above with two horns, and one behind with a horn on the ear.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	 And with your hand more strongly when using the cautery until it makes a small impression on the ear; and the membranes are torn from it; so that breathing becomes easier for great exhalations from it; and also cauterize it through its nose as well, according to what has preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	 In that Lepra has already spread over a limb and is now clearly visible; it should be cautorized using these cautories which we mentioned for the head, and to cautorize both ends of the nose as well as two cautories above the collar bone at both sides, six above the dorsal vertebrae, one above the tailbone itself, on each side over the hip joints, two over the elbows, two over the chest area of the person, and to cautorize him over all connections with the help of your hands and feet.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	 And cautorize those nerves above the heel so that you do not crush them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	 When a cautory is to be applied over the mouth of the nose or the stomach, and another one over the ear.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	 You know that if there is a greater amount of cautery applied, then it will be more intense and more effective.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	 You know that the patient did not feel any pain from the cautery as healthy people do; therefore, his body was already numb due to previous injuries or ailments.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	 It is necessary that the cautery be done in a way that it has power and control over the members and joints according to what came before from the sight of tools.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 After application of the cautery with flour and honey paste until it is healed
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	 The way to perform cauterization.
Caput L.	 Lepra
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	 If a limb is stunned and cannot be treated with medicines or oils, then cautorize the member as needed to increase its effectiveness according to how strong it was before.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	 Your cautery should not penetrate too deeply into the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 After applying the cautery with ointment until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	 "When cautery was applied to a certain paralysis that affected the hand and foot, it resulted in numbness of both members; upon which point the paralysis would cease.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	 "It is not to be considered beyond what one understands from an examination of the members and their exits (nerves).
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	 "Concerning the cautery used by Albucasis.
Caput LI.	 The first letter of "Libri" (books).
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	 "When Albucasis operates and finds nothing of importance in his examination of the cautery: then he makes a deeper incision with a sharp tool as needed, until the numbness is removed and the color returns.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	 "Afterwards he cures him with flour and herbs, and lathers him with oil and rose water; and washes his face with the columbine flower and hyacinth's blood: in one part is a mixture of all these ingredients; they are applied to the cloth, and held down until he is cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	 "Concerning the cautery used for cancer.
Caput LII.	 The second letter of "Libri" (books).
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	 "When the cancer is new or first appearing and you have touched it; then he cautorizes him with a circular cautery within his circle as before.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	 "The wise men said that cautery should be applied last of all to the middle part.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	 "But it is not clear to me; for I fear that it will fester, and I have already seen this sometimes.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	 "It is better then that the cautery be applied within its circle as before; or with many tools (cauteries).
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	 "Concerning the cautery used by Albucasis.
Caput LIII.	 The 33rd letter of "Libri" (books).
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	 "When someone has adubelates and is delayed by their maturation or over-abundance of semen; or from old age when they are weakened in blood supply; or from time to wait until the maturation process is complete, then cautorizes him within his circle with many points of a cautery.
Deinde dimitte eam.	 And he dismisses her.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	 She will celebrate with maturity.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	 If the perforation is made skillfully and carefully, then a cautery iron of this form is applied to close it.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	 And he places her [the patient] between the hands of Aebulatus; then let him penetrate with a knife until it reaches to the cautery iron which is its form.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	 After that, take care of him so as to be cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	 Cauterize using a corrosive substance instead.
Caput LIIII.	 Caput (head).
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	 The corrosion is not only the corruption of a member that moves, but also he was corrupted; just as fire burns wood without fail.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	 Therefore, if you want to use a corrosive substance on the place that allows the cautery with fire, then apply many irons of different sizes and shapes at once, in proportion to where the corrosion is occurring.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	 After that, cauterize him from all sides until you remove the entire corruption without leaving any trace of it.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	 After that, dismiss him three days and place a substance of sulfur mixed with oil on the cautery points so as to remove all ashes entirely without leaving any trace or corruption.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	 And take care of him using various ointments.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	 If that is the case after three days he becomes born with a healthy birth and no corruption exists, it's good news.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	 And if not so; then apply another cautery on the place from which the corruption still remains.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	 The corrosion is treated sometimes with a sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	 This will result in a spot of cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	 But if the cautery is done with fire; and I myself said that it should be done with a sharp medicine, then you must take her there when she becomes ready for it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	 Cauterize using Claws and Pricks (scab blisters).
Caput LV.	 "head L
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	 An abscess formed on the foot's lower parts; it is large, and has a thick discharge that wets the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	 A cautery was applied to them [the abscess], according to two methods: with fire and also with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	 When it was done with fire, the cautery was applied to a depth of about as deep as the thumb nail; and then there is an edge that is very thin.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	 Then let the flame be placed on top of the cloth.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	 Then let the hand be brought around with the cautery towards the depth of the cloth; and after three days it will reach to the bottom of the cloth, until a discharge begins from its top.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	 Then let [the cautery] be wrapped around with many strings and placed upon him at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	 That will remove it from its source (or roots).
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then let a cure be applied to the affected place with unguent and oil; until [the patient is] cured or healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	 If they are not cured and many abscesses occur on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet; then apply cautery with hot water to them; or you can use a needle or pen's tip; and let that be placed upon the cloth as well.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	 Then let the small amount of hot water be applied to it; hold your hand firmly tight and bring your arm around with a compression of your hand, so that the edge of the needle will reach deep into the cloth towards its root; and expect it to begin dripping cold water from its top towards the bottom and the roots. And you should watch closely for how long until an hour has passed before any pain or discomfort comes due to the application of hot water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	 Then let it be removed because the cloth is destroyed along with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	 Do this to them all one at a time, until you have applied it on everyone who was affected by them.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	 Afterwards, when they have been removed, it generates flesh from the fat.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	 Cauterization in trembling
Caput LVI.	 Sixth cranial nerve (oculomotor).
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	 If a tremor occurs due to cold, or fourth fever, or any other cause: then it must be cauterized with four cauteries, or five above the ribs, and across every rib, and on his chest, and above his stomach.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	 The tremor ceases when cauterized with oil of vitriol, and health is restored due to the cold's chilliness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	 Cauterization by Albtahir.
Caput LVII.	 Seventh cranial nerve (trochlear).
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	 When Albtahir's food is expelled from the body, that is, when pus forms on the surfaces of the flesh due to corruption of materials.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	 Therefore first, when appearing, they should be cautorized over every head with a subtle cautery using the end of a steel wire, which is heated on fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	 Or with the root of the long-stemmed Aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	 Or with a small cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	 And when they are being cautorized at the beginning of their expulsion, according to this manner; and no more is added; and fat is removed from them, making them healthy; and they heal through that.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	 Nevertheless it is necessary after the evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	 Cauterization from flowing blood out of arteries to veins.
Caput LVIII.	 Eighth cranial nerve (oculomotor).
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	 Many times due to the flow of blood from the artery that was cut on the vein, causing external damage; or by cutting a vein through an incision in the member, and similar things happen to him, making it very difficult for him to be separated from them.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	 Therefore when that occurs to him, immediately with your hand put it over the opening of the artery and put your finger on top; and pull him very hard until his blood is underneath your finger, so that nothing escapes from him.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	 In order to cauterize a vein with olive oil and a large number of them at once; after applying it, the vein should be burned through
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 After taking one, or a few, or many veins (as required), and placing the ligature over that place where the artery was divided; after you have withdrawn your finger, hold tightly on to the ligature until blood stops flowing.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	 If you expel the ligature along with your finger from the artery's opening; after removing it, take another one and apply it more quickly to those veins that have already been heated up (preheated).
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Do not cease doing this with one ligature after another until blood stops flowing.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	 And also ensure that you do not crush the small veins nearby and put it over a damaged artery.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	 And you know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to tear it apart; especially if there is a major artery involved unless with four or more methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	 Or using a ligature, as we have said before.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	 Or by extraction, when it is not extracted (removed).
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	 When it's extracted, its extremities are crushed and blood stops flowing.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	 Or with a strong ligature (cord).
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	 And if placed on it medicines of property are applied to stop the blood flow; and tied with a gentle constriction of the veins (ligature).
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	 Who administers excision with a ligature and constriction using a cloth or other method; and the same for them, except rare cases.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	 If you are not present to him at the time; then start with placing your finger over the opening of that vein as we have described before and constriction around it until the blood has stopped flowing above the knee and over the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	 And your finger should not be removed super it with a cold water application to the cold forever until frozen and swollen and torn apart.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	 "In the meantime, take note of what is appropriate either from the surgeon's skill or medical science.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	 On incision, perforation and phlebotomy on veins (of the same kind).
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	 I am the tenth in my chapter of a hundred, every eagerness with both the cautery and medicine, and their occasions, causes of theirs, and their instruments, and forms of the cauteries.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	 And I placed them from the wrist to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	 And I proceeded by this chapter, so that he could be relieved of his search.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	 And before I begin that, please note the sons of Adam, what is from terror in this chapter it is from the first chapter on cautery.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	 And therefore it is necessary to be cautious when performing the operation here, because many times during this chapter the evacuation with blood comes up, and so life perishes from the opening of one vein or incision above the thumb, or the exit wound, or care for veins, or extraction of arrows, or incision over stone, and others: from which all tremble, fear falls into many deaths.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	 And I remind you so that it does not fall upon you what is the hatred, because sometimes they come to you by this art of men with the modes of weakness.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	 From these is he who is angry with his own eagerness and the death of him follows: because of his eagerness that which entered from his weakness and its length made him miserable.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	 And when the fear which means death comes out,
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	 and he who gives his own sting to you and said with him hoping for health, the eagerness of his is deadly.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	 Therefore do not let him who came upon you from those whose mode is like that agree to you.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	 "Let your caution be greater than your desire and folly.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	 "Except for something proven by knowledge in that which brought about a praiseworthy result.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	 "In treating all the sick of yours and yours, prognosis and indication are necessary for that which is better for your health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	 "This thing will be a great help to you in acquiring fame and glory as well as reputation and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	 "God or His sons have inspired you with their intelligence and did not give you direction and inspiration because that was already in your hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	 "I also ordered this chapter by distinguishing it from the chapters of caution until its end at your feet so that you may be relieved of what you sought and know for which purpose.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	 "About the treatment of water accumulated in chapters of boys.
Caput I.	 "Chapter 1.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	 "It is known that this disease often occurs in boys at birth either when the midwife pulls a boy's head free from his mother's womb without proper care.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	 "And it also occurs by an obscure cause that is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	 "I also did not see this affliction as severe in others as it was in boys, and death often resulted from that. Therefore I thought it necessary to remove the operation of that part.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	 "I also saw from a boy whose head was bound with water and the head became magnificent every day until it could not lie flat on itself because of the size of its head; and moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	 "This also is moisture either under the chin or on top of the nose.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	 "In that there is moisture between the chin and mouth, the operation must be done to find a wound on the head, so that it makes a split longitudinally across the middle of the head; and its length should be as two knots.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	 This is a delicate form
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	 If the humidity is greater, and therefore the seal becomes larger, then make two incisions in order to reach this shape
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	 And if the humidity is under bone and its seal, which you wish to open up completely all over, then water will be depressed when you press it with your hand towards the inside, and this cannot be hidden from you: so that three incisions should be made in the middle of the head, as I said earlier.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	 After making an incision, remove all the humidity.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	 Then tie up the incisions with cloth and wool
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	 And then wrap it tightly from above with wine, oil, and olive oil until tomorrow morning.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	 Then apply a bandage and take care of the wounds with strips and ointment.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	 And do not tie up your head evenly.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	 And keep it moist with dry food until the member is recovered and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	 Another method of incision is to determine where the seal becomes large, and then collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	 Because sometimes there may be a greater injury on one side or another, so that when there is an incision you should consider if it occurs to the left or right.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	 Then ascend with the incision where you see the seal and collection of water, until that is done according to what you can do.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	 And observe not to cut the artery and cause the flow of blood, causing death for the limb with removal of humidity.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	 Of incision in arteries that are behind the ears.
Caput II.	 Head Two
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	 When wounds occur on the eyes or face and become healed, then further care is not given to it, except for one last incision at that point, of the two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	 Then you must make an incision in order for the limb to be raised up when needed.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	 Afterwards tie a bandage tightly on place with strips and then show the arteries.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	 While supporting his head with one hand and holding a towel in another
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	 After he has supported himself as described above, let him come over here.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 The two places are the ones that are below the ears of both people and they do not commonly happen unless some men have them.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	 Then he signs with a cistus over each and strikes both of them with a spatula, causing one to fall into the mouth as far as its height extends upwards from the head; then let this be done along the length of the forehead.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	 And if there is a vein, he enters with a spatula under it and strikes at its top with an incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	 The length of the incision should be like two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	 When an incision is made on one, a blood flow escapes from it, which splashes into frequent streams inside.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	 If the artery is not visible to him, then he should measure off three fingers' widths of space from the ear.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	 Then he signs with a cistus and finds himself up until his mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	 That which it is necessary to extract from the blood should be done in one inch or more out of him and less than that.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	 Do all this according to the amount which appears to you from the veins of his body, being attentive at the same time to the fullness and looseness of his arteries as well.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	 After he has supported himself as described above, let him come over here.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	 If anything is left from the cistus in his mouth after he has found it, then he strikes that and does not let it drop on a cold one; then you should support his head with linen strips.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 After he signs as described above, care for him with unguent until he becomes better.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	 Of the extraction of the arteries that are inside the temples
Caput III.	 Head Three
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	 When a man has a hemorrhage on the old side of his head or an acute catarrh from acrid and sour fluids due to coldness in the ears, or he is suffering from a hangover with nausea; and also similar cases: then it should be treated as we have taught you before, and not put that there. Then our master taught us how to do the extraction of arteries from the temples and cauterization on the same principle.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	 To make an incision into the ears, there is a method by which to remove the hairs that are within the borders of it, and then direct this towards the visible artery at its place
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	 When you receive from your own pulse, it is rare to be hidden unless only a few people or extreme cold
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	 If that happens (it's rare), then he ties up his head with a cloth and then quickly covers the place with it.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	 Or if there is warmth in the place, then an immediate appearance of a visible thing would appear to you.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	 Then take quickly what I made before
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	 And then you will remove the wound with it in a gentle way and direct towards the artery at its place.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	 Then pull gently towards it and remove it from above and then remove the piece of cloth that is below it from every part of it.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	 If the artery is thin, then gently take it with a hook to it.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Then remove the part that you cut from its length as they are extended and contracted, so that no blood would flow out.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	 If not an incision is made or if not a removal of it occurs, then there will be no ascent of the red liquid (blood).
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	 Then remove with water from blood to VI and III.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If the artery is thick, then it should be taken out at two places with a double cord or cord of bone and either from both sides towards its own decomposition before fixing in wounds or there will be blood flow out.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	 Then remove the excess that is between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	 Do this at that moment or after a certain time (?).
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	 And if it is necessary to burn the wound with a cautery until it reaches the mouth while holding back the cautery and then the extremities of it are taken out so that it will stay in its own work place.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	 "The best work is not that which has no feverish weakness in its body, nor one with a heated complexion.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	 Because the cautery is applied to those who are running towards dry heat or dryness
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	 Therefore it's best for them
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	 After removal of arteries, let there be applied a clot made from old blood and placed upon it with gentle care the products (ointments) mentioned above.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	 And after application of a dry solution made from herbs and ointments until it is born [i.e., the meat has been cured], then with liquids (scalpels) until it becomes healthy.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If in the meantime the flow of blood from an artery has been blocked by a cautery or the like, then quickly approach and remove him with the cautery, or until you have opened the vein (with a knife) and removed the blood with your hand [to prevent loss].
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	 If there is nothing of that sort present to you at this moment, then place a finger over the locus and wait until the blood becomes frozen.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	 And cover it with ice-cold water until the heat subsides, then bandage it according to what is needed [i.e., as directed by a doctor].
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	 And from that which is best and easiest to remove an artery with (the use of) this cautery having two irons; the heat of both irons being similar, they are able to apply it easily and quickly [i.e., with little effort].
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	 However, their heat is much less than that of two irons.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	 Because if they are acute (hot), the same as two irons, let them apply alternately with ice; and not cut meat while applying.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	 As a result of that there is much less fat on them and they hold the heat of fire; and the flesh is removed either with ice or by force (cutting); as for this reason it is best in all matters, most efficient, and most easy [i.e., to perform surgery].
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	 And let there be a space between the two irons of the same size as the thickness of your fingers; after that you apply both irons with wax and each one ignites, until they reach the mouth and are applied to the flesh in two places [i.e., on either side]. So it is stretched out what lies between his extremities.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	 The wound should not be treated with this method/means
Et haec est forma cauterii.	 This is a form of cautery (burning).
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	 For the treatment of tears and burns on the eyes.
Caput IIII.	 The head is now treated with cautery (burning).
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	 When tears are very wet and they are over the top of the skull; and nothing of a medical treatment should be applied to them with medicines; you have become red, you feel it on your forehead like a burn from the eyebrows; and his eyes are made moist, so that the hair has already been burnt by this corrosive solution. And then the eyelashes of him were treated in such a way as prescribed for removing eyebrow hairs, they called what was done to them "curation" (removal).
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	 It is so that you shave the hair on his forehead that are very thick
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	 After the forehead is shaved (remove eyebrows), make three incisions equidistant from each other along the length of the face; and the length of one such incision may be about two fingers wide, and one between the nostrils in the middle of the forehead, and another on both sides at a distance farther than the motion of tears. And for the cutting of the arteries that are on both sides: and with your extended hand from the front to back and the side to side as much as three times the length of three fingers combined; or you can take sponges or many wet cloths, while you prevent excessive loss of blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	 After that, insert a small hook into the other two needles and their end is like this (shape).
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	 Until the incision that is on the other side of time and with it you cover all the skin that is between the two incisions up to this point (shape).
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	 And then do this, as well until the middle incision
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	 And then take out this small hook and put it into the first incision again (another needle) from a slack part of that one but not from another part.
Et haec est forma eius.	 This is his shape/form
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	 He cuts off the artery with its own force and severs it at once together with veins; he then loosens his mouth-level vein, and pulls him forwards, until he reaches halfway to that which is visible of his belly: when this happens, he must cut through to the bone, removing everything below from head to eyes.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	 Afterwards make an incision at half the distance towards another groove/cut
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	 After he has pulled him forward with his own strength to halfway through that which is visible of his belly, he loosens up the vein from his mouth level and pulls him further forwards until he reaches half-way towards another groove/cut
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	 Afterwards, with the assistance of a hollow tube (pulliolus) made from a gourd and/or reed, he pours in all cuts up until now, and on top of them, oil or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 He loosens it so that the incision does not get cold/chilly.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	 On the third day he loosens up the ligature and administers a hot infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	 Afterwards, he treats it with the ointment of the Basilisk (a type of lizard), and all the other things that are being treated: until it is well/cured.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	 He treats the eyes with tears, and the nose with catarrh from within the head.
Caput V.	 Head V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	 When one of the acute catarrh falls upon him (the patient), he is swollen and inflamed in all his parts; his eyes are drawn out with great tension, and it has become visible that they are now weakened: and he has ulcers on his eyelids, and the hairs fall off from them, and there is a very sharp pain in his head too, unbearable, so that he cannot endure/bear this any longer.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	 The treatment for this situation is as follows.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	 He loosens his throat/choke him so that he may vomit forth the phlegm/catarrh.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	 Afterwards, make an incision in the middle of his face or above it further upwards by distance/length, and make a start at once from the left side towards the right side with the cut made on the left; then make him swallow your hand until you reach to his mouth: when this is done, you will remove all blood along with sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	 "Cut between the two lips and apply ointment made from linen if it is a fresh tear.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 After that tie off with cotton wool, then drink the mixture of wine and oil to prevent your mouth from getting cold.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	 And when it is time for eating, you must know that your mouth will soon be cold; at this point you should spit out the food so that saliva can cover it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	 After that care for it with the following regimen so that it makes flesh grow; as if you were eating two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophon: prepare an ointment from these ingredients, and administer this to promote the growth of flesh on these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	 "Care for him when he falls into the sea.
Caput VI.	 The sixth head
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	 Every time someone falls into the sea, there are four species involved: rocks of various kinds like iron and stone; or it could be from plants such as iron, wine, and grain; or any other type of liquid.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	 When someone falls into the sea from a rock, or any other kind of stone that is not added to it so that it grows on top, remove that particular rock and distill something from olive oil instead.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	 After that administer the extraction to him and apply it with a bandage around his mouth so he can swallow anything from food or cloth, after tying off his head by using hair or wool and extending upwards towards the top of his head.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	 "For many reasons this kind of care is needed.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	 If not, then administer the extraction with Signatura (a medical term) using a device of that kind; its shape is like this one.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	 So if you use Signatura instead, it's good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	 And if not that, then administer the extraction with a blind-folded device made of fine threads.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	 If not through this method (using the blindfolded device), then make a sheath out of air and insert its end into the ear canal with much force; and apply what is in the sheath around it gently with olive oil so that there should only be one path, from which you extract forcefully using your own strong pull.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	 We have to agree with him about what we will discuss
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	 If you don't agree with him this way: take it from the bowl or spoon, prepared as follows, so that what is taken can be seen clearly: then place it at the end of your thumb after you hold on to it firmly and securely with both hands while turning upwards towards her gently but carefully.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	 If we cannot agree on what to discuss then proceed with the following steps: first make sure it is hot and soft before you take hold of it; if not, try again after a short pause.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	 And the method for making an incision is to cut through the veins first and then extract the blood according to its measure of virtue and strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	 Then firmly grasp the limb of him that you are to treat and turn it towards yourself above; then gently find a proper place in the root of his ear near his fat part; after this sit the incision as a crescent moon shape; and when he is ready, remove him with the thing which can be done by means.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 After that you have gently opened up your incision while holding onto it, then care for yourself until it is healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	 If a swelling occurs on the ear from one of the veins which are increasing and becoming inflamed then you should give him an administration for its removal.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	 If this is not agreeable to you at the end of it then take hold of it gently and subtly according to this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	 And you administer it with him the cutting out of this part from the veins which fall in the ear and do not make that happen when you think that one of these ear veins is already swollen; after this place it on a plate many times: then remove them gently, or subtly through the use of fingers, or by sucking up, just as we said.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	 If water runs into the ear then you must let the person who is sick cough with it first and foremost; after that have filled their own ear with some old fat and hold on to them firmly while standing over them so they are above the ear which has the water in it.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	 If I am correct, it is good
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	 If not (i.e., if I am wrong), take many stones, according to the length of your fingers, thin and light, and ignite them with a fire from above so that they may strike him on his head; also throw one over his foot from there, and hit him in the head with another stone near at hand,
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	 Then it would not be done until all the water had been consumed by stones and stones.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	 And I am correct (i.e., I have consumed the water), take one from a pyre and another from a jug; and insert both extremities into his head; and light both with fire until all of them are burnt up.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	 Then take another and repeat this many times until all the water is consumed; and remove her (i.e., extract them) with a cannula according to what was taken from the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	 In removing animals inserted into her, if it is light of body, as a puppy; and him (i.e., to that one) care for him like I said in the cutting up.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	 However if it is heavy body which appear to sense; then administer the removal of him with a gesture, and hands; and his remains are easier for all who hold them (i.e., take them) from the head.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	 In removing the products of generation into her head when you care for him as I said in the cutting up and in the distillation treatment; and not to concern yourself with the care; then it is necessary that you strike his head on the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	 If therefore something appears there from the products of generation, then take away (i.e., remove) that with a gesture or hands.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	 If however nothing appears there (i.e., if the products of generation do not appear), then take a cannula whose form is narrow below, and wide above; and insert a small extremity into his head according to what he can tolerate from that (i.e., according to how much weakness he has); afterwards suck with these strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	 "Let every (man) go forth.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	 If they do not obey you at the time of departure, then surround them with a cord and lead them out as I have shown on stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	 Which, if they do not go out with him as we have shown: then administer the distilled extracts that are already familiar to those who are experienced in treating wounds; and apply this to the passage of the distillate.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	 And your breath is released through you as oil is poured out and medicines are applied around with this instrument whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	 Like the pipe from lead, or from air, narrower at its lower end where there are the pulmonary holes and wider above it.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	 Therefore let him pushing which is on the tube of the cannula be done from the air by less force.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	 Take the tube from him with a gentle hand; and when you come to that part of his clothing which is next, apply it gently too as I have described for oil; then pour out the oil or take something else suitable, such as he has already mixed into them in the cannula: and this must be applied on top. After that release the tube with a hand compressed in a tempered way so that its force may drive the oil through the cannula to him who needs it; feel him gently when you come near there, and apply it warm at one end of his body; do not let any cold medicine enter into this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	 The care of hair injuries
Caput VII.	 Head VII
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	 When some infants from mothers are separated, the ears may be torn.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	 And it also happened to some men of old that the hair was plucked out from their ear by force or flesh.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	 And this plucking sometimes happens deep into the ear canal but does not come out; and sometimes it is done to only a small part of the outside ear hole and comes out as well.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	 Therefore those that happen deep into the ear canal but cannot be seen are difficult to treat because of their many positions.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	 In that area where the bleeding occurs one must put on a tourniquet at once and press it firmly into the sun; next, make an incision there; then if you see a visible vein, open it with a delicate yet sharp instrument, whose form is such that it follows what was described above. The extremity of this part should have some slackness to its extent, while another part shall be acute: and remaining parts must gently move in opposite directions so as not to harm the tourniquet
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	 If therefore bleeding has occurred through an ear canal; then tie it with a delicate instrument and make an incision into the ear as quickly as possible.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	 If bleeding has occurred deep within the ear; then take a delicate instrument and gently heat it with fire until you have cauterized it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	 If you encounter bleeding with that which has become weakened through repeated blows to the ear; tie off its opening quickly and cauterize it so as not to damage the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	 Then put on the ear an ointment according to its size and extent of the holes; use it for some days until you are secure from weakening.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	 Or take an ointment, and pour it into a hot bath; rub away the old one with its mixture of vinegar and honey, and then use this new one
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	 If you see the ear is detached; then take off the ointment and let it remain with another one that has been mixed with olive oil from an earlier application so as to be used for healing.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	 If a blood flow occurs; then immerse the sponge or towels into cold water and put it over the ear canal; continue using the remaining cure that was used to remove the bleeding from the previous treatment of distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	 Of the cure for eye-lids.
Caput VIII.	 The eighth head.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	 These are the eyelid eyelids when they are moist and dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	 "Therefore let you hold them with the fingers (of both hands), or with one hand and strike them with the nails of your other hand.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	 Then place it on the swelling, saying:
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	 If any blood flows from them, then burn them with a fine curved needle
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	 And after the cut is made, it will be better to burn them.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	 For many times they return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	 And if we burn them with fire, the roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	 The care of cataracts in the eyes.
Caput IX.	 The ninth part
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	 Many times an injury occurs in the eyes that is similar to what Crandinus does with his great strength and toughness; hence it is called granum (a kind of cataract). The aggregation of large moisture above and below the eyelid is also called a granum.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	 Therefore there is an operation to be done when you see one of these cataracts starting on the eyelid and spreading to both sides; it will be easy for them to remove all parts of it.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	 Find then a hole with a width that is large enough
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	 Then shave off all the parts around it until it is gone.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	 Then suspend them with one hand and remove them separately.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	 If the incision is not made by you or someone else, then it will be harmful to that person only after they have penetrated with an incision more deeply.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the hole is large, then gather up all of it using sutures; and care for them until they are healed.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	 And if the hole is small, you will not suffer any harm from that.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	 But when it is restored and healed,
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	 If the granum is located on the inside of your ear and the surface of its inner side, then you should remove it from both sides of that incision with one hand; but after removing the incision itself, be sure to remove all parts of it completely.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	 When an eyelid is stretched due to cutting it does not cause harm
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	 After the incision of a blue eye with salt water, and take care when putting in place to prevent injury.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	 The treatment of eyelids
Caput X.	 It's unclear what this is referring to without more context.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	 The treatment of eyes (Axirnath) when they are being pulled up towards the forehead by the eyelashes during sleep or in a fit: and this can happen to children who are slapped with their eyelids shut by a hard object on waking, and thus cannot open their eyes to the sun; therefore, because the tears flow into those eyes constantly due to the swelling of the lids, which often make them moist. And the prominence of Axirnath appears in an eye when one approaches it with one's fingers, and one feels Axirnath between those eyes
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 The method for treating this is to place the patient's head on your lap (in a sitting position).
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	 Then take the bandage and prepare it on his head as if wrapping around him completely from all sides according to the extent of swelling that affects Axirnath.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	 Then put it on top of her and press with both hands all around so that Axirnath is centered within the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	 Then find a middle between the wetness and the tears with a break due to latitudinal slippage that does not result in larger breaks than those from phlebotomy in the deep (venous punctures).
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	 It may be that you will have to find a complete break so that the tears of Axirnath from multiple sources can accumulate on the white lining of the rupture, as Axirnath tends to come out through small breaks due to the form of the tear's edges being white.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	 So take it out with a bandage that you applied to the outside of your hands and hold tightly as needed on both sides until the tears disperse; then, do not apply anything into the wound so that no more tears run down onto his eye and remove him from there.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	 If you cannot see Axirnath at the beginning of the wound incision, then make it as small and as simple as possible while it is still being made; after that, cut into Axirnath
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	 After making a small incision like we have taught you to do.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	 After that pour vinegar and water over the wound, then place them on top of it, and bind it up with bandages.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	 And there are those who have brought salt to the wound and place it in a damp state within the incision so that what remained from before may be softened by the moisture.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it is healed
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	 If you make a mistake while making the incision and bandage it with dry bandages to prevent infection; then take care of it until it is healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	 Regarding the application of Ataxmir for treating eye problems: when the eyelid becomes more relaxed and soft from using Ataxmir, it will be as it should be; that is, smooth like a normal eyelid, not dry or irritated
Caput XI.	 The end.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	 When eyelashes on the eyelids become longer than normal and grow beyond their course under natural hairs, they then cause discomfort to the eye; they can make it tearful, dry out its lubrication, whiteness of the eyes, until it leads to the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	 Ataxmir is indeed used for treating four ways in the eyes.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	 Or by burning with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	 Or by using a strong medicine that has been mentioned elsewhere on this page about cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	 Or by making an incision and bandage.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	 By using a tube or cannula, as I said earlier.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 It is advisable to put your head on the table of the surgeon, where it will be held by the surgeon.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	 After that, you close the eyelid with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	 So if it is done correctly, this is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	 If not, insert a thread from the lower part of the eyelid and pull it through with the needle on top, then bind it up near the eyebrows; that is, near the upper edge of the eyelid where eyelashes grow out of, and draw the thread to the other side with your hand along with the bandage.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	 "Furthermore, find that eyelid is covered with hairs and swollen by dropsy near to tears up to tears, but not below.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	 "Next remove the eyelid's thread and place a small pad of cotton or cloth beneath it; then apply a mixture of soot (encaustrum) to the upper lid in the shape of a mourning veil.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	 "However, it is necessary that this image be proportionate to the size and thickness of eyelids; because it varies among humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	 "In such cases, apply only enough to cover the eyelid, as its size is reduced by dropsy.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	 "Finally, find that eyelid is swollen by dropsy near to tears up to tears, and it has one cut through the natural hairs of upper lid (to prevent infection), as its size is similar to a large radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	 "Finally, remove the thread from the other eyelid's corner.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	 "Then remove this whole structure.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	 "Finally, apply a bandage with two lips and the thread of fine wool; then remove blood, make it to adhere where there is excess from the hairs on top of both eyebrows, or not, don't do anything.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	 "Finally, remove sutures and thread for three days at least; then care for this.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	 "If you wish to do so, remove the ulcer without sutures and care for it with its own removal and constriction.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	 "The eyelid is enlarged by ulcers in both of them; but a future improvement may come from this.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	 "These are the methods used for treating Ataxmir by those before us.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	 "However, there is great eagerness to improve it; and this can be done with good surgery without fear of danger.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	 "Another method for treating Ataxmir is as follows; and it is that a mourning veil be applied to the upper lid in the shape of an image on the eyelids like we have shown.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	 After having separated the vessels, either separately or together, according to this shape which follows, I shall cut away what is excessive with smooth, curved knives, according to this same pattern, cutting equally
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	 If you are unable to hold one vessel separately but it is equal to that, then take another thread in the place where there was one, and insert it into the middle of the figure; afterwards insert another thread closer to the lachrymal (teary) vein more than, and another closer to it less. And arrange your fingers so as to cut equally.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	 After having separated the vessel with equal treatment of both hands, I will make an incision above what is marked down by my right hand, just as we did before.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Afterwards, tie the two lips with a thread, and carefully sew it up until it is done.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	 If you happen to encounter any difficulties while making the incision or tie, use this thread gently and carefully as if it were honey.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	 And sometimes when encountering an eyelid and eyelashes too, we will turn its hair inward.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	 Therefore, let us proceed to the suturing as before mentioned, except that sewing both is more difficult and requires greater artifice.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	 Of the treatment of the eye with a stick
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	 And it is that you gently separate the eyelid and cut away what remains according to what was said before.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	 Afterwards with art make two threads or two slender hairs of the same length as the eyelid's height and width shorter than it; and you have already made an incision at both ends where your fingers are held apart equally.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	 Afterwards, tie both firmly to the excess of the eyelid and release them after a certain time; this is how you will complete the suturing.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	 The strict cut must come to an end quickly, and the incision must be degraded over time until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	 If it takes time, then immediately cut through with scissors
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then, once healed
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	 Once dried and firm, the eyelid opens up; hair does not itch.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	 These are the forms of two canals on the face that follow this shape and measurement, length and width
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	 The itching of eyelids with sight
Caput XII.	 Head 12.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	 There is an operation here to gently insert a thread from the soft part of your hand through this slit for suturing, do not be rough.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	 Then gather both ends of his thread and knot them in a simple knot; let one end of the thread be short.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	 Then put another thread through it from below in a quick knot and tie both ends to each other's ends tightly, firmly.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	 Then place your own head gently into your hand and perform the operation; for this is a subtile or minute operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	 Then insert the thread into the root of your eyelid and make it penetrate more deeply into the eyelid until you have extracted a natural hair from there.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	 Then draw out the thread until it is above the slit; then insert into the slit of the other end a hair or two hairs or three hairs, but not more hairs.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	 Then take hold with your hand and draw it out until the natural hair comes through along with the thread from the slit of the eyelid.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	 If the thread is drawn out but no hair comes through along with it from the slit of the eyelid; then draw the thread down to the lower end where you placed the knot in its beginning and until you come out of the upper opening, tie both ends together firmly on the eye socket. And after three days or so let a hair grow out there by itself and fall upon his face.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	 If the hair is short then tie another long one onto it from the natural hairs and draw it out with him; or let it be tied down until after a time passes by itself and then extract it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	 On how to heal an ulcer that is located above the eyelid
Caput XIII.	 Chapter Thirteen
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	 When an ulcer appears in the eye, it is called lypophora.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 It can be either a natural occurrence or an accidental injury to the eyelid.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	 If it is accidental, then it could be caused by a blow, cut, burn, or similar injuries.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	 The method of treatment is as follows: to find the cause (e.g., a cut), and then separate his upper eyelid from that part of it which was injured; next you should put some liniment or ointment on the wound itself, so that if there's any eye inside it, you can save its sight by carefully removing all the membranes from around the eye.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	 You should not do any more treatment on his other parts that are affected and restricted by the injury, for if you make this mistake, it will worsen what was already injured; instead of using a soothing substance to calm down those parts which are being irritated, like soothing liniment: and smear with water until you have soaked all the membrane from around the eye.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	 Your treasury of remedies is that they are used carefully and intelligently so as not to become consolidated, according to how it was done at first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	 This treatment we mentioned earlier is only a remedy to heal the ulcer, and not anything that would undo the shape of the place where it was located after all.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	 How to heal an ulcer below the eyelid that is a swelling or contraction of the upper part towards one's right and left side.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter Fourteen.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	 This is an ulcer that appears below the eyelid, which they call lypophora.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	 It can be either a natural occurrence or an accidental injury to the eyelid.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	 If it is accidental, then it could be caused by a cut, burn, or similar injuries.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	 The method of treatment is as follows: to cut through the double fold (filum), and then pull it out from the skin, and make sure it goes up towards the inner corner of the left eye; and then go back down to the outer corner of the right eye, until you have pulled the double fold all the way.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	 In order to remove flesh from above downwardly with an incision and strike it with a blunt instrument on one side
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	 If the figure of the second eyelid is as required, this is good
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	 If not the figure of the second eyelid is as required, take a piece and place it in an incision, and remove it with that eyelid; and find two incisions on one side inside the eyelid, and are the extremities of the two incisions from two angles of the incision, until they coincide and there must be made out of them angle; when they gather up there is to make out of them figure, and there is Greek letter praise.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	 Afterward remove the flesh by amount, which is the length of his eyelid lower than that one follows; from it follows the eyelid
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	 Afterwards collect the separate parts: tie her with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	 Afterward take care of them as we have said, by means of medicines and oils until they become well.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	 And if the eyelids of Alxatrati are injured with an incision and stitching or cauterization; it is necessary that you find a flat incision under the eyelashes, also according to what has come before it.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	 Afterward separate between two lips with oil, as we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	 And finally of the care of Alxatrati when it is above or below, as it should follow from the operation according to what was prepared by shape of Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	 This is the multiplicity of shapes: and a wise craftsman prepares the mind with whatever way it can be; until he redirects figure to a natural form or close by her, and him same infirm, according to what was arranged for him from the operation and instruments in many positions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	 With joining eyelids or cornea.
Caput XV.	 The fifteenth chapter.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	 Whenever this consolidation occurs among many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye and prohibits him from his own operations naturally.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	 "It is allowed that you move the end of the forearm beneath the eyelid and lift it up; or extend it with a hook; thereafter cut off its attachment with fine tools in order not to cause pain by incising the palm with such instruments, so as to be bent downwards; after which the eye will be healed securely without causing any discomfort, when released according to its natural form.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	 "At that time, pour into the eye a saline solution; or distill it from fresh water, so as to dissolve its contents by means of water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	 "Afterwards separate the eyelid from the eye by means of a small line; and put over it an infused thread with white wool; after three days use it along with bandages.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	 "From cutting the forearm and the arm above the elbow [to] the tears of sorrow.
Caput XVI.	 "Head Six
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	 "It is known that the forearm has two methods.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	 "One method is smooth; and the other is like a sickle, sharp-pointed, and fine.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	 "The other method is not smooth; it's like the blade of a frozen white water; when it strikes on iron, or grasps it with a hook, it can cut through and does not remain stuck within.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	 "Both of them do not start until they have met with tears that are greater; and after a while (the time varies) when they meet the eye, they close it off from seeing or moving.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 "The mode of operation in cutting this is to put your head into its embrace [i.e., strangle you].
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	 "Afterwards open his eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	 "Then grip the forearm using a hook of double teeth, and extend it upwards [to strangle him].
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	 "Then take the hook from the horse's hair and bristles; bind it with a cord; or fasten it in any other way: make it strong enough so that its double points bend [the forearm] upwards, and tie them at the middle of the forearm to prevent slipping away and to enter into him by means of an acute point. And when you have entered, bind him tight with the string from the horse's hair; extend his arm up towards above; and cut off any hairs that follow after the pupil, unless you grasp it [the arm] until its very end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	 In such cases, cut off the excess of the lacrimal ridge with a fine needle and spit out the natural meat of the eye, so that it does not run down from the incision like tears in the course of its habitual activity
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	 And sometimes with a thorn or with a thread as we have said before.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	 After that it is scraped off using the fine needle mentioned above, this is its shape.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	 And let it not break through to the skin around the eye and tear out the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 After making the incision: In the eye apply a small amount of something salty or from a bandage soaked with it and let it come out by itself until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	 Then take care of that which is necessary to be healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	 If the thorn is not pointed and cannot be put into it without causing damage to the eye or by tearing out its flesh, then you should apply various medicines with the help of a needle as described before for healing such kinds of wounds.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	 If you are to make an incision in it then open the eye with a fine needle and take out what is pointed and thin, mild and of low sharpness according to its shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	 And wipe off the thorn after the incision using a fine needle.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	 If you find that the thorn is being removed and it has been cut or pierced into the eye but for this reason of its own shape then let it go out by itself from your eyes in a small amount of salty liquid, wet bandage soaked with it or salt, until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 Then repeat the operation above until he is removed completely.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	 Unless there are cold objects inside your eye then you should let that go and take care of the eyelid until it is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the operation above until he is removed completely.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	 However, if the flesh of the eye is being harmed and the damage is significant, you should suspend it with a thorn or thread and make an incision on that part of him; and do not make incisions after this to prevent the course of tears from continuing.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	 After washing with tear-off liquid, it is necessary for him who wants to succeed
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	 By making an incision through the sphincter muscle and placing the flesh into the eye.
Caput XVII.	 The seventeenth part of the body.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	 It is necessary when some human flesh has been mixed or placed into the eye, so that it can be opened and moved towards the pupil of the eye, or pressed against it, or even drawn over the eyelids themselves, and in any case it will turn away from the external part of the eyelid.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And this operation is also necessary so that a sick person can place their own head into your arms.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	 After washing with tear-off liquid, you should open their eyes and hold the entire flesh together with the fingers while gently guiding it towards that; or hold onto it with one finger, or by grasping it.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	 First make an incision into their body and then completely bring all of them together using the tool you have.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	 After this, you should not insert it into the operation unless absolutely necessary; or make a separate incision at your end to bring them together with hooks, which we will apply in that incision above their eyes: or hold onto them with several fingers while they are being brought together by those hooks, so that after all these operations are complete and completed, his head should be removed.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	 After you have made your incision and removed the entire flesh from their body, then wash off the tear-off liquid as soon as possible; or dissolve it into a warm broth with corrosive medicines to soften its hardness; and place that over their eye so that any frost can be prevented by rubbing on it.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	 If anything remains from their flesh and you have a warm blood to hand, then let it go; and rub onto the eye with the warmth of another's hands so that any frost can be prevented by rubbing on it.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	 After this has been done for them, you should continue to perform your work until they are finished.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	 And do the same thing with any flesh that falls into the eye by this method.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	 Although it is necessary to restore the sight of someone whose eye has become weak from natural causes or accident, by means of iron; and you should not insert your hand into any of their operations, until this thing which is causing the problem with them has been removed
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	 Removal of a cataract
Caput XVIII.	 Head 18
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	 The new growths that occur on the eye prevent the patient from performing their own operation; and they weaken the eye as time goes by.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	 It is therefore necessary for you first to check if the cataract in that eye is strong and there are no other causes of weakness apart from it; then remove the cataract itself.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And after this, so as to help them most effectively, you should place your head on your shoulder.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	 Then hold on to the new growths with one or two fingers according to your judgment; and make sure that both fingers are soft enough so they can fit into the body of each patient separately, or if there are two patients have them both in their bodies at once, depending on how you choose.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	 Then remove the new growths gently and carefully with very soft fingers; after which you should wait until they are removed from their eyes, at that time your finger tips will be worn down.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	 And if you perform the surgery during daylight, and hold on firmly to your own hand while performing it; so that you do not strike only them but nothing else.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	 Then after the eye is dilated and ready for your work or growth to be removed; you will bring out that one or both growths with your own force, so they are destroyed by its sharpness.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	 If you are unable to remove the entire growth at that moment; then use a separate instrument to hold on to only that part of the eye which causes pain in it; and wait for days until the pain has subsided completely, after which you will try once again according to this manner until it is cured.
Et haec est forma forficis.	 This is the shape of scissors.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	 Reduction from the nose
Caput XIX.	 The head has 19 bones.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	 A barber who treats with a razor must use it gently to avoid injury, or if an acute remedy is prescribed, the narration should follow that procedure.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	 If it does not heal itself immediately (i.e., the barbering did not help), then there is no remedy left; unless one finds a remedy outside his body, and purges all the moisture that is in him until he opens his mouth.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	 As soon as it was opened, one could see within the corruption or blackness (i.e., the infected area), then he treated him with an instrument of that shape.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	 The barber is called a doctor of the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	 Let him shave the head with a razor such that it is round and smooth as flint, or with a more pointed one for a more precise shave; then place him over the corrupted bone of his forehead.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	 Then take him between your fingers and press gently with the other hand until you know that the corruption is no longer there; then put it down on an area of its own.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	 After that, restore the place by rubbing it with stippled sticks (i.e., pumice stone).
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	 If the place is restored and there arises flesh within it, and a discharge from the disease course away; then after forty days it remains, does not grow again, nor falls off on its own, neither does any bad thing happen to him by chance; then you know that he has already been healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	 If not, there is no remedy left within it unless one reduces the razor to the nose hole; as such a shape requires.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	 If you want to shave him with a blade and find that the second bone is not visible due to his hair; or if he is treated with an acute remedy; or when you know the mouth has been opened; then take the comb of this shape and apply it firmly, its end tapering as shown, to his forehead.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	 In turn place that over his head; and it should run towards tears; and stretch out your hand from your shoulder as much as possible
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	 Then remove your hand from the eyebrow; and let it penetrate into his eye; and feel that with this (hand) he caused him to escape from there when holding his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	 So then restore the place while the physicians are attending; just as they have shown you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	 With that being born is the flesh, and becomes fixed place; then material which had been towards the external, it returns to the nose; therefore this latter one above him who was ill.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	 Of reducing importance of the eye
Caput XX.	 Head xx
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	 When the eye comes out with its entire extent and does not fall into a socket or tear, neither decrease nor diminution; then it is necessary that one should alone attend upon him who was ill; afterwards draw off his blood; later place them in the ear without incision but with a tube.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	 Afterwards place over the eye ointment which is made from acacia and aloe and oil of myrrh and carmine.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	 Afterwards stretch out the eye above on top of the socket with many a filament.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	 And the mode of the filaments is this way; that you take the long hairs and make many from them on top of four; thereafter place one atop another in their quantity as it pertains to the eye; afterwards stretch out over them with a hard cloth, and bind tightly.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	 And repeat this action using only a tube.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	 Afterwards draw off the tubes and release the eye tightly every day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	 If however the second filament becomes slackened then it is necessary to stretch out much; afterwards draw off the second filament at day and night as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	 If however you see that the eye is well covered then this is a good thing; and if not, then repeat stretching out of filaments as we have said until he becomes healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	 On opening
Caput XXI.	 On opening the skull.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	 When the disruption of the skull occurs within the vein's tunic, afterwards it emerges and proceeds outward to the eyeballs as a mass of blood does, and it becomes shaped like that of a man due to this; so you should strike at its base from below to above
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	 Afterwards pierce another with two veins next to the eye and lead her into it; and release the first one according to your own arrangement.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	 Afterwards you strike the two veins' place and tie her around with it; and tighten her much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	 Afterwards you draw out of him and place a ligature around his eye; then release him until the vein is entwined with it.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Afterwards treat the eye as such that it be cured from its wound.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	 And when you tie a linen ring around all of it (the vein) with cordage until the eye's height is greatly increased.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	 Afterwards you draw it forth gently with a slippery substance so that moisture may enter the eye; then you move it down and bring water to it quickly; afterwards tie him up until he is cured.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	 On treatment of the eyes
Caput XXII.	 On opening the skull.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	 The treatment which is called Alcmonatic, unless it be healed, gathers together into the eye like water descending, and itself is not.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	 The mode of operation with this is that you make a bed for the sick person above or below, as it suits him
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	 Afterwards take his head in your two hands from the two sides and move it until you bring him to the lower part of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	 Afterwards it lies there and does not fall down; its light is extinguished; the sick person sees as he saw before: if it did not go downwards, you know that water has gone.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	 "If one does not prepare a descent of veins with that which we have said, then let him proceed to sit on your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	 Next take the delicate sponge and find it above the skin's surface at a place where you have joined its end to the tunic of the cornea on top of the eyebrows, until it reaches the veins.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then proceed to pour the warm water into the eye where you have previously applied it with honey or wine: first apply it separately and then mix together with the rest of the treatment until healing occurs.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	 For the cure of the water that has descended into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	 Head 23
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	 We have previously mentioned the species of water for cutting and perforation; now take it in accordance with health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then it is necessary for you to proceed so that the sick person sits on your hands squared and opposite the sun, near the top; secure his eye with your right hand if the left eye has water, or with your left hand if the right eye does: then draw him gently towards his face, release heave-ho, repeat this until both eyes are healed.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Afterwards take with your right hand the balm if it is on the left eye, or with your left hand if it is on the right; gently draw towards his face and release.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	 Afterwards place the thumb on the top of the head through the length of your arm; gently draw it towards you with care and respect until it penetrates into the tear duct; and then you will realize that the balm has already reached its purpose in healing.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	 And it is necessary that the measure of the path of the balm reach deeply; and the distance from pupil to end of the black part of the eye up to its border is measured, which is the edge of the eyelid.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	 For both then apply it to the pupil itself on account of clearing the tunic of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	 Afterwards place the balm up until the place where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	 Therefore place it beneath another piece
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	 If it descends from water immediately, then that part of the body receives a swift blow and is struck down by its own hand immediately thereafter, and blood is seen to come out of his eye
Deinde quiescas paululum.	 Therefore, let the arrow rest
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	 If it descends from water, then let that second piece be set aside, except for what might come forth with a thrust.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	 When it comes to pass and does not rise up: then remove that piece along with its companion quickly and you will make haste with your own hand.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	 Therefore dissolve it in water, so as to extract a clear stone from within; then remove its eye after it has been extracted.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	 Therefore place the entire shield upon the eye, or tie a loop of fresh oil around it; and put honey on its edge as well; then bind with it a band for the eye to be restored.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	 And we, who are of our times, place upon him a fillet of thin linen with honey on it.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	 If the arrow is not removed from your eye because of its sharpness, although it has come forth by a human hand, whose eye is harsh and hard; then let you take this thing called Alerid, which has that form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	 Therefore bind it with the same knot as tightly as you can, and do not use your hand to thrust it out; only let it be so that you make a way leading to its place cleverly.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	 Therefore insert the arrow according to what we said earlier.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	 And at the completion of your work there will be an infirm bed placed with care in that dark house where he lies lying on his back; and it is forbidden to move by all ways, and not so either: and place for him food as nature has made necessary for him: and let his head remain fixed straight neither right nor left.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	 And have the bandage placed according to your own disposition, from one day until another.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	 Therefore place it in that dark house and make him see the face of a man.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	 "Then cut back the tendon up to seven days.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	 "Do not let it be done during the period of care or immediately after incision; but it is necessary that another person do this as soon as possible so that water can rise quickly through a wound made by the cut.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	 "If the wound becomes cold, then it is necessary that another person open one eye before seven days and correct this with him who holds the knife until he finishes; at that point cut off his head and lay it on top of his mouth so that the eyes are lowered as much as possible under a dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	 "Then go to the home gradually and become accustomed to your cases.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	 "You know that a student should not be excused from practicing for a certain amount of time; then he may dare to perform the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	 "And indeed from someone among those who are of Albucasis it was said that the deed had been done by cutting a hole to let water through.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	 "Indeed I did not find someone from your own land who had done that; nor could I find it in any of the ancient books and it is possible to make this new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	 "These are the species shapes from the magda so that he may stay on top of them who has forgotten about them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	 "Be they from the true air and with this same subtleness of triangles as sides and sharp extremity.
Formae magda.	 "The shape of the magda.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	 "Of the care for the newborn child's nose.
Caput XXIIII.	 "The head is twenty-four.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	 "When there are many diverse things added to the nose of a child born; and from this is something that resembles the legs of many scorpions and from this arises a cancerous vein which is made up of flesh colors and from this arises one that is soft but not made of flesh.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	 "In those therefore which are soft and not deceitful nor cancerous it is necessary that you make them rest in the hand of one against whom you have placed it alone; and open their nostrils to him; then strike off once into these meats, and then draw them out towards the outside; and cut what you comprehended from them with a delicate sharp blow at part.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	 "If anything remains after its removal whose severance is impossible, then with the help of a subtle instrument that facilitates this may not be removed.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	 "If blood is dominated by you or a cold arrow hits your eye, then apply what's necessary to the arrowhead: either from malicious arrows, cauterize him with fire, until the blood comes out, and all the meat will be removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	 "Then apply vinegar or water (or wine) after making an incision.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	 "If the nose is opened and proceeds to the palate from it until a state of health has been reached.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	 "If humidity does not penetrate as it should, then you know that the meat was cooked at a higher temperature than usual.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	 "Then you must put a thread in the nose with some quantity of knots to hold it fast and tie all the other knots tightly together so that there is only one knot left loose: or you can loosen the thread as much as possible until you have reached this same result from before, and then remove your breath.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	 "Many boys do it similarly at home or school: and for them there is ease gained.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	 "Then tie one end of the thread to the nose so that it protrudes over the nose and leaves another end still in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	 "After this, attach a piece of meat with all its knots tied securely.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	 "Do it until you know that the meats are now ready to eat.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	 "After this, remove the thread and put on your nose what you have rubbed with Egyptian unguent: do it for three days or longer until the unguent has completely coated anything remaining from the meat.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 "Finally, tie off the final part of your thread to a nail at the end of three days or more until you are done.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	 If a patient dies because of neglect in care then she/he should be used (treated).
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	 The head should be washed with olive oil and other medicines introduced into the nose; this must be done gently using a small tube in order to resemble an opening such as that of a snail, open it like this (demonstrating): then exhale forcefully through the mouth.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	 And if one's nose is blocked, use a small tube just like a straw
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	 The tube should be used for washing the head when it is full; remove your hand from its opening and pull back with a force as you exhale through that olive oil or whatever else is inside, using your other hand to support her/him while holding on to this opening, then exhale forcefully out of them.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	 This is the form of the tube.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	 Of the cure for a runny nose
Caput XXV.	 Chapter 25
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	 Many a runny nose arises from the extreme heat of the nose and improves with time until its appearance is greatly improved.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	 And therefore it should be done that he may recover from this as much as possible at the beginning of its appearance and completely remove it all.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	 Then apply a bandage over the area or use something else to treat what is there (i.e., medicine)
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	 If it is delayed in opening him up, until he improves greatly; then consider if there are stones or other objects present and avoid touching them with the iron as that would be cancerous.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	 Indeed many a man was struck by lightning striking his nose and then fell from above with great harm to him who had held him.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	 And if the nose is gently touched and not stained with color then you use it to open him up completely until he is treated (in other words, as much as possible) and without fear or hesitation strike at it and treat its location that causes harm and pain until he is healed.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	 Of the repair of the nose, lips, and ears.
Caput XXVI.	 Twenty-six head
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 When the solution to continuity of cartilage is interrupted on the scalp only in some people
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when the continuity of cartilage is interrupted in someone else's scalp as well, you should observe whether there is a wound with its own blood and then apply pressure to control bleeding while stitching it up, after which care for him until he recovers.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	 If the continuity of cartilage is already separated and one healthy portion has been formed, then it's necessary to cover all parts with its own apparent blood until bleeding stops.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then apply pressure to both lips and sew it up while also applying a strip of its own blood from the dragon's veins on top. After this, remove excess blood and trim away any fraying with scissors so that there is no space between; then cover all parts except for one part that has been bound together by other strips; lastly, release him after two or three days if he does not recover himself within these limits.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	 After all this, you give him a different medicine and release him until the stitches come undone on their own.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with an ointment so that he recovers.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	 The method of stitching is either to join the continuity of the cartilage or by using a needle as I showed you for sewing through the flesh; whichever way you choose.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	 From the loosening of hairs.
Caput XXVII.	 Twenty-seven head
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	 Many people have hard lumps on the inside of their scalp as well as some smaller and larger ones.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	 Therefore it is necessary to cover all of the lumps on his scalp with a bandage and bind him up tightly using twine so that no hair can escape from any part of them; afterwards cut away everything except for one lump if he does not recover within these limits.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 After the wound has been sewn up, put a bandage in place and bind it tightly to prevent bleeding until it stops on its own.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	 After this he is treated with vinegar so that the stickiness is dissolved and the wound continues to heal until it stops on its own.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	 From the cutting of the upper lip over the gums
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	 There arises a swelling over the gums when meat is added to it, which they call abuluss
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	 It is therefore expedient to hold it with a knife or tongs, to pull it out when burned by fire, to strike off its head at the place where you find its root, and then let blood flow forth freely, either to make it run away, or to cut it into pieces, as you please.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	 Then place a stone upon the ground and cut off its head quickly with the sword or other sharp tool.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	 If it returns after being cooked, as often happens, then strike off its head the second time and burn or scald it; but this does not happen afterwards.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	 About the reason of teeth with iron
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter 29
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	 When the teeth are set in the upper and lower surfaces of the gums from their inner to outer parts by their roots, and when they come away or fall out through the gums as thorns or when they are extracted with a tool between the gums, then these will be lost, and so the teeth will fall out because of this corruption towards the gums.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	 It is therefore expedient to hold them in your hands securely and fasten its head into your mouth, so that you can bite it and the root of it also: until you have torn off their roots as thistles or thorns from the ground similarly; until nothing more comes out of these after this fashion.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	 If therefore the corruption of these had already happened at first, this is well; and if not, then do another attempt with them on a different day later
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	 You know that the reason for removing teeth varies according to different shapes and figures of many kinds; depending on how you prepare your operation; it is one thing when tearing out a tooth from its lower part, quite another when it is torn between the teeth, in accordance with different forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	 These are the forms of razors that you will find in me.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	 On the extraction of toothache
Caput XXX.	 The head
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	 The purpose is to treat the pain with all your ingenuity and get rid of it completely.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	 It is not the case that someone relieves him when he has been eradicated; because it's a sublime substance: until there is no excuse for eradication of it, then you need to do it when you realize it is weak and get rid of it completely, so that it may be certified in front of you.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	 Many times the weak person becomes pain because there is a substance that is in his tooth and gets rid of it; then the pain does not come back until he has been eradicated completely by the weak person.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	 We have already understood this from the operation of phlebotomists.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	 After that it is certified by you to the weak toothache person, then it is necessary for sacrifices with spatumili around the teeth so that there will be some virtues, until a cure is given from all parts; and then move him with your digits or with sharp tips first gently, until he is pushed out.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	 After that you put the powerful sharp fingers in a good way into his head between your thighs and let him go down as far as possible; and then gently pull out the tooth by its root according to its direction so it won't break off.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If this does not work then take something from their instruments and introduce it underneath him with all ease, and move its movement gently as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	 If the tooth has been perforated or burned then you should try to cover it with a cloth and gently pull it out using your fingers which are smooth at the tips so that it won't break off during a contraction of your hand when it is grasped by forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	 And you should strive to make incisions around the teeth and cut out all parts as much as possible.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	 And preserve your strength so that it won't break off and the part of it will remain, and the pain which is greater than any other harm to him at first shall be removed from her evil mischief.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	 "And do not cause that which ignorant phlebotomists perform during their own feebleness and audacity over the removal of it.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	 Many phlebotomists perform excessive bleeding on the bodies of very sick people whose veins are hardest to reach and their roots remain in place, or some of them pluck it out with the help of a mandibles - as we have tested many times that is how they do it.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	 After removal of it and then alcohol (ethanol) or vinegar are applied to coagulate the blood.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	 If excessive bleeding occurs after removal of it then apply something from the vessel and seal it with a hot iron or else cauterize it as soon as possible if not applying anything.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	 The small arteries will be squeezed when brought into contact with the teeth, and they are of great importance because their removal may lead to excessive bleeding from the larger vessels; therefore it is important that these smaller arteries remain intact as much as possible before sealing them, or else cauterize them immediately if not applying anything.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	 And sometimes the extremities are like a cork that is tightly closed by force of constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	 On the removal of teeth and the extraction of fractured mandibular bones.
Caput XXXI.	 The 31st head
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	 If a tooth is broken during removal of teeth and it remains in place then apply butter once or twice days to soften the spot, thereafter cut through with scissors or pliers; the extremities will be squeezed out by the cork that is tightly closed by force.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	 This form is for squeezing/cauterizing.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	 The extremities are made to be squeezed like a thumbtack or pliers.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	 If you are not able to remove it with those pliers then apply pressure on the root and cut off the entire meat or use a tool like Palanca's [which appears to be a type of scalpel]
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	 The left side of both upper limbs should be equal in size and strength, with no excess on one side that might cause an imbalance or injury
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	 If the left arm is considered to be better than the right one in terms of strength and size, that should be beneficial; however, if not, it will lead to problems as other instruments would need to be used instead with different forms.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	 The triangular form on the left side of both upper limbs has some excess or extra size.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	 The smaller triangle shape is seen on the left side of both upper limbs.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	 It will be necessary to use this instrument with two arms, which has this form.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	 And along with other instruments and tools that preceded it based on the reason of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	 The necessary tool with this instrument that matches a large hook of its form which is triangular on both upper limbs and causing some extra size to prevent any injury; it should not be consumed
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	 It is known that tools of teeth are many; and similarly other tools will not be taken into account as the craftsman wise has found an appropriate tool himself based on what was done to him and his skills
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	 Because of the differences in species among those instruments that came before it, the craftsperson took note of them so he could choose the right one for his needs.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	 If the mouth is broken off by the jaw or any other bones of the face, or if it gets decayed: then seek to remove that from its place with what suited him out of the tools and hooks which I described for extracting the root, and use your hands, whose form this one has.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	 There may be some small extra size in it so that it can be drawn tight or held securely with it the mouth; and not burst nor collapse until it is restored to its place using medicines which are appropriate for this.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If there is some decay or rust on the bone then remove that from its place with its own decay and care until it is cured.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	 From the top of teeth to other instruments.
Caput XXXII.	 The twelfth head
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	 When the teeth project beyond their normal course downward (as seen through a mirror), food gets caught by this form; especially when it happens to women and infants, namely the former.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore you should take note of that fact
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 If a tooth is born after another tooth and does not fit or can be secured with it, then the opening for that tooth should be made; if an extra tooth is attached to another one, then it should be cut off together with the other using this instrument whose form we have mentioned before.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	 It's like a knife, but sharp on both sides and at its end.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	 And you should make an incision to release it from days of many teeth, especially because of the hardness of the teeth and so that another tooth does not come out through the teeth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	 If a tooth is protruding beyond its cavity (as seen through a mirror), then you should cut it off using this instrument whose form we have mentioned before.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	 It is all cut off by that instrument; the lesser holes of its hand are widened gently and easily (using this instrument), so as to release it from many days with ease without getting injured or falling down: thereafter you loosen it slightly, in fine cutting away a piece together with certain rasors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	 If the tooth is fractured and the opening is narrowed, you should also cut off the tongue in order to release it as well; thereafter it should be softened with the help of this instrument so that its bitterness is lessened: then it must not be left to grow back or be bitter, lest a piece of it gets separated.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	 Of cutting off teeth when falling from an eagle's beak.
Caput XXXIII.	 The thirteenth head
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	 When the teeth before it had been struck by an impact and shaken because of that blow and could not be pulled back from what was eaten so as to not fall down; you cured them with stipped remedies (perhaps with a hot iron) but did not care for their cure: then a piece of wire is put in, so they can be drawn out through the eagle's beak.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	 A thread is a medium through which passes subtlety and force according to its quantity, passing between teeth
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	 The form of the thread is as follows: when you grasp it between two healthy teeths, then you pass it through a second time into another tooth; thereafter you draw out with both hands from one tooth to the next until reaching the other's tooth or returning back to your own.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	 After passing through the middle tooth you continue with a further pass of the thread until you come to the part where you first took hold; thereafter you draw out your hand holding it firmly but carefully using subtlety and wisdom so that the constriction at the roots of the teeth does not slip off.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	 Afterwards you remove the extra thread ends and gather them together; thereafter with a twist you bring each end around to cross over between the healthy tooth and the moving tooth so that the tongue does not slip off, then after this is done release the pressure gradually until finally released.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	 If it breaks or gets caught you should tie a new thread on and hold onto this one as tightly as before for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	 And here is the shape of teeth: and the form of the two healthy teeths, and the two moving teeth.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	 Sometimes when one tooth falls out or two fall together at the same time and in their places they cling to us like a raven and remain there until an expert carpenter is present.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	 Sometimes when a tooth is pulled out by the roots there occurs just as with the shape of teeths and it is placed in its place where the pain begins and held tightly so that we may remain until finished.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	 Of the cutting ligament below the tongue and prohibits this one.
Caput XXXIIII.	 The 44th chapter
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	 When the cutting ligament below the tongue is either natural, with which man is born or accidental, and has already been consolidated (i.e., a cut that has healed over).
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	 The operation is performed so that you open the mouth of him with your hand at his head and draw out his tongue; thereafter cut through the soft ligament according to its length until it can be drawn out by the strength of your tongue.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	 When there is a knot or twist within the bone and flesh, it can be released by cutting through the tendon which binds them together; then you should cut through the joint in question along its length until you reach the knot or twist, after which you will find it with your fingers and extract it.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And if there is a tear within the deep flesh, cut through the artery at that point, and block off the flow of blood.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	 Then, apply a hot or cold compress to the wound.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	 Then place something soft and thin under your tongue that will keep you from getting sick all night; so you won't catch a cold again the next day.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	 If there is blood flow at the wound site, then apply pressure with a cloth above it.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If you bleed from the wound, then apply a heated wire to it as quickly as possible; after that, treat it with remaining care until it's healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	 To remove a knot or twist in your throat:
Caput XXXV.	 The 35th chapter.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	 When the tongue is swollen and restricted by the action of its own natural operations; or even more powerfully, when it swells up to such an extent that it makes breathing difficult.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	 The operation on you is done so that your mouth may open easily before the sun; and consider the swelling of the tongue.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	 If therefore you see that color is blotted or darkened so as to be unpleasant and cause discomfort; then do not touch it because it's a tumor.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	 If there is an abscess that has become white from the moisture it contains, then you should cut through it to release its contents and free it completely from all around it.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	 If you bleed from the wound during your own procedure, then apply pressure above it; wait until the bleeding stops; and afterwards proceed with the rest of the treatment to remove him along with his complement
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then apply it with vinegar and salt; continue treating with what's left until you heal it.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	 Of the two types of amputations
Caput XXXVI.	 Concerning the severed head
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	 When a severed head occurs between the tongue and pharynx, that is, the thyroid glands, which are similar to blood vessels, when they occur they die; and two names for them are given: the first one is to be treated with what we previously mentioned in our description of healing wounds, but not to heal, then consider this.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	 Therefore if the amputation has occurred and is already bad smelling with pus accumulating a few senses; do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	 And if the stump is red and its root is large; do not touch it either with iron or any other object of that sort, lest you cause a bloody flow, and then the limb dies.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	 Therefore at this point if you accidentally cut through it, or if it cuts itself off;
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	 And if the stump is white and round with a thin root; then it should be burned to death.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 And the operation itself is that you consider before your operation if it occurs to cut off the amputated limb quietly and completely or with a small amount of force; then do this: sit back in front of the sun and have its head placed inside yours; open up his mouth and receive him into your arms, and press upon his lower lip beneath an instrument whose shape is like this.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	 It should be done with silver or air as light as the breath of life.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	 After you have taken the tongue with your lips, show him to be amputated and falls upon his face into yours; then take one hand and hold it within the arm pit, and draw her out as much as you can beyond what you grasp from the garment.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	 Then cut off with that instrument whose shape follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	 And if the bleeding comes from the wounds of his ears; then treat them with iron, either by removing blood or by cautery.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	 But if that is not present now, then cut it off using a blunt object whose shape follows.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	 "Cut away from one side; not cut away from the other side.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	 After cutting through to the bone in one place, make a second cut on the opposite side of the same incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	 Afterwards after making an incision, he should gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If bleeding occurs when cutting into a vessel, he should gargle with water in which the inner bark of trees has been removed (such as tree bark or willow leaves), and other such things that would stop the flow; then after care for him to prevent further loss of blood until the flow is stopped.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	 And sometimes there are blisters formed on one side of the tongue, but not both sides.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	 Cut then that on which I said to cut evenly through both tonsils.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	 And I myself once attended to a woman who had been born between the two tonsils, causing a fistula through her throat; she was able to breathe very poorly and had already closed up the fistula: but also she did not allow food or drink anymore, until finally she died within one day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	 And only the fistula rose up to such a height that it extended over both nostrils as well: until then there were openings for two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	 Therefore I fixed him with one of them stopped.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	 Afterwards, I pulled him out, and the part that was taken from him is very large.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	 Afterwards, I cut off what came out through my nostrils.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	 Afterwards I made that into him which had come out from the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	 Afterwards I opened his mouth and pressed on the tongue of him; afterwards fixed one of them into him, and cut off from him a part of him, and he did not run out except for very little blood: so it was after that her throat was healed, and she quickly began to drink water again, and then received food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	 Therefore I did not cease to cut into him the tonsils for a long time; and each time that he had recovered from one of them, it would happen again after another until at last this happened.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	 I cauterized a glottis (larynx) between teeth
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	 Then having done that, immediately after walking around to the left part and not knowing what God did with her thereafter.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	 I cut through the glottis (larynx)
Caput XXXVII.	 The 37th head
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	 When the catarrh (phlegm) descends to the glottis and becomes blocked, then it is named perpendicular; but if on the lower part it is round, then it is called uvula.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	 When treating it as we mentioned earlier on division and not curing it; you see that the glottis is warm and soft from this, then you must strike at it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	 And what is gathered round and not its length, it is bloody or coloured black or dark; but it does not feel the touch of a hand, then you must strike at his incision.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	 In this there lies a fear to the weak.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	 You should then, when you see it according to what I said earlier from the white and its length that you would make him sit before the sun; and speak with his mouth accompanied by an instrument whose story preceded this one: then strike at once below into the water and drag her downward, and strike her also with one of two instruments which I mentioned in the division of the two amigdala.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	 And it is necessary that you do not cut from it unless something is added upon a natural termination without any addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	 If you strike at it more, then speech and voice will come forth.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	 After the cut, use what we mentioned earlier on division of two amigdala; and cure her until she is cured.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	 If the weak one withdraws from the cut, then it is necessary that you put your mind into his cauterizing without fear or trembling.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 And the mode of cautery in this lies not unless with sharp water; and it is necessary that you put your head into your hands (into a basin).
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	 And with his instrument as we have mentioned
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	 And with his instrument as we have mentioned, he takes from water what I gave you for cauterizing in the chapter on cautery and binds it without burning out completely and without puncturing or pricking, nor too thick nor too thin, but that its fit may be placed here by this instrument's shape.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	 The end of his instrument is where the medicine is inserted as it were into the middle ear.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	 And he puts the instrument with medicine upon this very same place and is held by it from falling off to one side so that it runs out of his mouth through its intrinsic medicine lest it does not go down into his throat anything and may it be satisfied.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	 And hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	 And you from above that measure of the hour of meeting and until you have taken it in hand and satisfied its satiation with the medicine's biting.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	 And if you should take it by the other hand and bring him over to his right side with medicine while holding onto its head by its tail until he holds on to it above that place.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	 Do this many times until the consequence of what you do in cautery be fulfilled.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	 Then release it: she shall then cease and fall after three days or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	 If you should want the medicine more than once, then one of it every time and after cautery from around with its head into butter and moistens with him that is within his circle by medicine's and binds with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	 And he cured from outside with a bandage and inside with gargling until he was healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	 Therefore, the way of treatment is better for incision and longer in fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	 And sometimes he treats also with that which is more subtle than cautery and incision; for it cures when done with suffocation according to this manner.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	 Sume calamentum, and hyssopum, and origanum, and rutam, and sseah, and chamomillam, and abrotanum, and similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant. Et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter. Et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	 Be filled with oil or air: and let the extremity be filled up, where is granatum, into the mouth of a sick person until he ascends to drink from above through a cannula until he drinks much water
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	 Then repeat this many times as long as needed.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	 And you, do not make this treatment start with the entrance of the apostles.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	 Indeed, if added to apostles: and you should not do that unless you are at a suitable temperature of the apostles' coldness.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	 If you do not have this instrument present to you then take a cannula and fill it in the extremity of him with a mixture of cold water so that his mouth cannot burn from drinking, because the cortex will prohibit drinking hot liquid, and this is through good treatment as long as he remains healthy.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	 Of removal of hairs and bones from hunger
Caput XXXVIII.	 The head 48th
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	 Many times the mouth will become dry or bones fish or another thing.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	 It is necessary therefore that you take what from them it shows above where the man falls, after having spoken to him through the instrument at the sun and is declared to be in his mouth.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	 And what does not appear to you and are hidden in the mouth it is necessary that you do a meal for the sick person before he digests with the belly in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	 Then perhaps there will come attached things through meals.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	 Either the sick person will not drink enough water one day or root of lettuce, or will swallow bread soaked in milk and eat it; or will take sponges from seawater with a light touch; and tie him up with a rope, then drink him.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	 After cutting through the place where the ribs are, and either the nose or the ear is taken out, then it's pulled back (back into its original position).
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	 If not after that as we mentioned, you take an instrument from the second bone according to this shape
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	 It's larger than the radius and its extremity has a lot of strength compared to what it inserted into its own throat with ease; hence he himself had his head lifted up above
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	 And it holds onto the tip of its tongue so that he does not fall back when pulled by force; and it pushes with him or the spine or inserts itself into his mouth using his own hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	 Indeed it is better when the sick person inserts something that has knowledge of its place to be attached; and he pushes downwards or draws with his own hand using an instrument above him until it reaches there in accordance with the amount prepared for him so that it can reach back where it was taken from.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	 On removing of the blood sucker.
Caput XXXIX.	 Head 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	 When the blood sucker is being treated with it what I mentioned in division from the care of medicines and not given, then look into its throat before the sun on its own face, or after the sun has risen above where he was told to take his instrument.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	 If it falls from your hand on the blood sucker then pull him out with a stronger grasp or using delicate gestures to get rid of it more easily.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	 If that is not possible with them then take a hollow tube and insert it into the throat of the sick person all the way down to the bottom of their throat; after that, insert another one made of iron heated by fire into the mouth of the same person in their care.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	 Do this many times and let the sick person stay away from water throughout the day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	 After that he will take a full glass of cold water and open his mouth into it; and he will put the other's mouth in with it without swallowing anything from it, and spit out the water after an hour using his own hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	 With this blood mixing with water it falls.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	 If the aforementioned (i.e., the blood) is not to be applied with that which we mix or pour it into, then immediately apply a pessuma on the head and with fingers, or if you use an instrument for fumigation after it has been mixed in suffumigation liquid.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	 As many times as this happens.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	 The mode of operation in the suffumigation is that you take a vessel and place the prunules (i.e., smoke) on it with fire. Also, there should be a cover placed over the top to protect the face from the smoke, and the instrument should go into the center where an opening has been made for it.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	 After this the suffering person should close their mouth and let out a sigh as they do not want to lose the suffumigation until you know that it has already reached to bloodletting.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	 Bloodletting must be done quickly
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	 If this does not fall immediately, repeat the suffumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	 The suffering person should remain quiet and eat salt, drink nothing but water, in order to maintain their health during this period of treatment.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	 It is necessary therefore that the bloodletting must be done with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	 And here is a form of an instrument from which the bloodletting can take place when it falls upon that surface.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	 They are similar to fingers in this regard unless there is a disease which prevents them from being inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	 Its extremities are similar to its ears which is called a cicuta, the one with a rough surface; when it comprehends something, it does not let go completely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	 The opening of the apophysis and their sectioning or removal is part of this treatment.
Caput XL.	 Head size L
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	 Species of apophysis are many and various depending on what is remembered about them; for example one species through a hole or sectioned by two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	 One is extracted from a certain species of seed and that which has comprehended by humidity
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	 The second mode is for places where it happens through the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	 Because the seed falls on the head, it is another by falling from a finger to the anus; and when it falls into the fleshy part of the body, it is another accident caused by falling off the finger joints; every one of them has his own judgment through operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	 And those that are not allowed to be perforated unless after the formation of seed in them, and complete it; and those that should be perforated while they are raw, and not mature according to the complement,
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	 As seeds that are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	 Because the seed falls near joints and is prolonged for it; until it becomes rotten what is around its place may become corrupted ligaments or perhaps the injury of his joint; so that cause a superior contraction of those members.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	 Or the seed is at the main part; because if you delay the perforation of him until he matures, it may be bitten or eaten by it, or through this main member
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	 Or it is near the anus; perforate him therefore immature: and do not let you perforate raw unless what is near the anus lest he does not putrefy deeply, and lasts to the inside of the anus, and there should be a fistula or at the end thereof that which may not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	 Let you know the time of perforation of seeds that is mature according to the complement; and there is at the onset of pain, recession fever, and reduction in redness, and pulse, and sharpness of head seeds; and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	 And let you do the same perforation at the lower place of seeds and more prominent; and it should be perforated extending in length of body if the seeds are in the hand and foot and places of the cat's ear, chords, nerves, arteries, veins and up to all equal locations which is not reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	 "When reflecting surfaces are exposed, lubricate with perforations in that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	 "When the aperture is in the fleshly place, it's better to remove its perforation and confirm its digestion thereafter.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	 "If you perforate it before that, the course of its juices will be prolonged by it and is full of filthiness and sourness; moreover, its lips may be broken down by it and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	 "And certain perforations are made according to the length of the body for necessity's sake, or according to that member which is necessary.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	 "And it's recommended to administer small perforations into many with small perforations and large perforations into few with large ones; or cut through many similarly sized perforations.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	 "And there are from perforations into which it's necessary to cut through the skin; and it should be done when already made as a patch is, or when it has ended its term, that it is dead: like what happened in many instances, so you may say, and with those.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	 "And from them are the ones that have three angles of section.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	 "And from those is it done like a leaf of mint.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	 "Like the anus.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	 "And from those are the ones that have circular and lunar sections; similar to them through their sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	 "That one whose head is not, like the perforations are flat; it's recommended to perforate that member by a superficial perforation, or just barely.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	 "And it's necessary when the perforation is large and has taken much pain; you should perforate him so that what is not within will be removed from outside of him, at that time; or remove by him a piece from him.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	 "Then the holes in the member are left for another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	 "Then he removes something from the pain again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	 "Do this repeatedly according to the degree of it, until he becomes exhausted; especially if someone is weak or a woman in labor, a boy small, an old man withered and spirits have been resolved by many discharges from animals: and perhaps death is approaching for him, so you do not see.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	 Therefore this chapter, great caution
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	 After you have made the hole and when you are about to pierce the aperture, it is necessary that you remove the wound; consider
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	 If there is a small incision in the wound, or if there is no incision at all, then apply linen or catgut ligature (thread).
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	 If the aperture is large and there are many perforations or fissures, it is necessary that you enter into every opening with ligature; until they penetrate to the end of the thread (i.e., until you have used up all your ligature).
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	 If you have parted the aperture with skin or have encircled it tightly in some other way: then it is necessary that you bind up this skin firmly with catgut (thread) until the third day, either as when making a shroud of linen cloth from wet flax, or by drawing out the skin and hair; unless there is moisture, tie it tight
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	 After this, take good care of that with which you have to do something by squeezing or by applying a compress.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	 If you have caused a hemorrhage during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar; after it has been absorbed by the linen cloth, place it over the place of the many bleeding wounds (i.e., cover them).
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	 If the hemorrhage persists after all these measures are taken, then it is necessary to seek out a physician or surgeon for further treatment.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	 If the aperture is large and there are many wounds nearby (i.e., if it has become infected), then you should mix in wine or oil with water and apply them to those places.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	 If it is in a place that becomes hard or tough with time, then you should apply the mixture of wine and water to this as well.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	 Until the third day as we have described, then it is necessary that you remove this aperture and apply whatever treatment was prescribed to him until he recovers (i.e., continue applying treatments until his wounds heal).
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	 This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the surgeon's care universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	 From the second half onwards I have already mentioned everything concerning his particular care to be done individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	 Of the sections of the hair which are cut off
Caput XLI.	 Head 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	 Cut off from the head sections of hair are pieces, and they resemble the feathers which are used to cover a bird's head; as if these were plucked by chickens.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	 And there are many kinds of them.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	 From these are the feathers which cover moisture like a hair's end; and from them which cover moisture similarly to nets and ropes; and they are similar; and from them are the hard sheets.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	 And in all sections, and their removal is not fearful, because when the removal of theirs does not produce a contrary state to an artery.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	 And the operation of their sections is so that you will recognize it when seen with an instrument which has been shaped after this; and until you know what it contains, its name is Incised.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	 If there should be that which contained moisture, then dry him up by cutting off a section of his length equal to the length of the surface section; in this manner.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	 And begin with a section from the line B to the line G; and if there is moisture in that place, then remove the hard sheet which contains it, but do not take away anything else from it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	 For many things remain after removing what was taken away from it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then plunge the body into the Egyptian unguent if there is present; and if not, in water and salt; and wash him with it, until you remove him up to another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	 This will be eroded by what remained from the cutting off.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then plunge the body into the Egyptian unguent for a second time and then a third time; and if there are any leftovers left after that, until you become confident because nothing was removed from it during the cutting off process, at which point you will wash him with the unguent, until he is clean.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	 If the abscess contains a knot and a pestle is available then dry it with this form; having a cross-shaped incision: remove pus from all parts of it, and put on display your own power through the tunic that contained him
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	 If however, contrary to you, I show an artery for you then follow what I tell you after this.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	 And similarly do it with the pestle if there is a stone; from the incision and care as we have mentioned previously.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	 The section over the pestle for stones is easier because it has few blood vessels and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	 Sometimes there are certain openings of the pestle which exist in the heads of some people who lack moisture.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	 This is because I have secured the pestle on a woman's head and inserted it as if into a stone; rough, white, unable to bend unless someone strikes him with something hard against it.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	 On the other hand if there are accidental openings on the head, except for these which occur in the heads of children and at the root of ears; their section is a surface one.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	 Or always from beneath the head, so that the flow of blood towards the lower part can be relieved.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	 Then care for it with what was suitable to them from curing.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	 Of the incision of the windpipe.
Caput XLII.	 The 42nd head.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	 These openings of the pestle have often occurred on the neck and under the shoulders as well as the chin; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body too.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	 And above those which occur from them on the neck are one and many; they are generated from discharge and all the windpipe is within its own tunic as it were with the knots of the pestle's head, so that we have mentioned previously.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	 There are many forms of the windpipe.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	 Stones are these that dry out; they are also those that take away moisture and they are also evil ones that do not obey the treatment regimen
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	 In this vein then [stones] you observe a good disposition towards the touch of whose face is near to red color and is removed from every part of the body, except for the ears. It should be shaved on both sides with a razor blade or a similar instrument until smooth.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	 And it's important to take extra caution so that no hairs are cut
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	 It should be done smoothly without leaving behind any rough edges so that it doesn't leave a mark on your hand when you cut yourself or upset the sick person and cuts off anything not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	 If you cut someone's artery or prevent yourself from continuing the operation then close the wound with a bandage until it stops bleeding and loosen any stitches that are in place to relieve the pain of wounds.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	 Do not use Redi for operations as blood is expelled from his veins during this process.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	 Then take a look with your finger at what was left by the stitches and cut them off to be rid of that.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	 If there is a large stitch in the root then it's important not to cut through that part of the vein or artery and you should do your best with two threads so that when it breaks it doesn't cause any harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	 Then remove excess water from the wound by using an Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	 After that apply proper care to it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	 If you cut all the way through a vein then you should close both lips over it quickly and tie them right away after that so they don't let out too much blood if there is any left from before.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	 "If you see that it is due to the size of a Strophe, then you should aim at cutting off its root and removing it as well, and apply the suture we mentioned.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	 "And if the moisture comes from a Strophe, perforate it with a superficial incision in order to show you where its maturity takes place; and make an opening below it following the same rule as we mentioned.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 "Next apply a dressing with ointment after the perforation and similarly for everything else that has remained corrupted; until you see that it is now dead; then cure it immediately using a dressing made of flesh as we mentioned, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	 "In the event of detachment from the epiglottis towards its opponent within the larynx through an accident.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter Thirty-Three
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	 "The ancients performed this incision into the Epiglottis but I did not see anyone of ours who had done it; and these are their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	 "However, in the presence of a synactium it is necessary to perform an incision into the epiglottis; because otherwise all veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	 "In those who have a hot tongue or stammering, when there is no roughness in the larynx; it should be with an incision into the epiglottis to escape from what happens because of pre-excision.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	 "Therefore when we wish to perform this incision, let us cut off the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis; in that which is between two rings by quantity, where it should be done as an excision without cartilage and instead into flesh. And this place is one who has been separated with flesh, and the veins are far away.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	 "If the physician is timid then he should stretch out a cutting from the throat using a forceps.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	 "Then finds the cutting and waits until it reaches to the larynx; he then should apply the blood vessels if he sees something from them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	 In the meantime we must close off that which is opened up by means of a small incision in order to drain out what has come forth through it; and when this process has been done, with excision of lips
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	 The opening was closed for some time
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	 And when the time comes that you are to make a second incision with two lips and without cartilage
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	 Then proceed to apply medicine which brings forth meat until it is cured.
Inquit Albucasis.	 Good bye Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	 In conclusion we must admit that the exposition is not until it is shown that something has been completed in time; and elevated to death, and wish to intercut through the desire of his own: they come to the second incision with Epiglotim so as to allow him to breathe in a place where there are four lips, and salvation from death. And for this reason, they will be removed after opening up, until the malice of the infirmity is finished, and is the malice of that three days, and almost himself: therefore then go ahead and take care of his incision, until it is cured.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	 And that which I heard through you it is; the one servant was initiated into prayer and sent with his mouth, and struck at it part of the airways
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	 I have been invited to the care of him, and put in place, just like the one is death.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	 Therefore take off from the incision, and enter with the blood which comes out of it lung
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	 I am therefore bound to go away from that one so as not to lead her in the future; and coming out of the incision was removed
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	 I have therefore done the incision of my own, and cared for it until it was cured; and it did not happen to the servant anything except that he went back after a day towards better dispositions of theirs.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	 And here I say what is not feared in the incision of Epiglotim.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	 "On the veins in the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	 The head has 44 veins.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	 This particular hernia of the throat is called "the great vein," and it is large compared to the body's color; and it occurs frequently in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	 It can occur either naturally or accidentally.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	 It is not by natural intention.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	 Accidentally, it can occur in two ways; one of them is similar to a knot tied with fishing line (?).
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	 The other way is like an artery knot, caused by a knot that forms from the artery itself.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	 And in this case, there is fear, and it's not allowed to make the swelling (?), unless it's just exposed; and you should try it or examine it with an intromission (?)
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	 If you have a similar knot of the veins and it's not blocked with any of the vessels; then remove it, just as knots are removed; if there is one held by the artery, remove that also along with this, if it is in the artery; otherwise, thoroughly examine him (?).
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 After treatment of its location while awaiting recovery.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	 "On the veins above the head.
Caput XLV.	 The head has 45 veins.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	 There are many varieties of veins; and I have already mentioned all the kinds to you, so it's important that one distinguishes between the vein here (?), and the artery (?)
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	 Therefore I say that when the artery becomes cold and has fevers and painless pains (?), until the excess heat is gone, and putrefaction is completed; then the fever and heat will cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	 When the vein is not cold and does not have fevers or pains, it contains its own sack (?), which is particular to them (?), and it's similar in color to the body; it has an opening like a purse (?) and makes things happen as a bateche (?) and big and small.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	 Either it inflates with air pressure (that is, pneumatic injection), or it saturates with moisture
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	 The colors of humidity are many
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 Therefore when you want to perform a circumcision on him, so that you can examine him and ask for his consent first with an instrument called the Intromissum, after which
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	 The mode of inquiry is established and universal to take this instrument so that you can grasp it and insert him into the humid place where you will come in contact with his genitals: And you will slowly withdraw your fingers until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	 After that, finally take hold of him with a second hand and measure its length accordingly to what you have just done.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	 Afterwards remove the instrument and consider it as it was returned from his genitals.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	 If humidity is flowing at this point, no matter what color it may be: Then dry him with a superficial cut
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	 And if humidity is not flowing in the Intromissum at this point you know that he is circumcised and so on: Dry him with a cross-shaped form having the same shape as what I just showed you: Hold onto his genitals, pull out skin from all sides with ease: And if you are able to hold onto it keep it away while examining him in the presence of Nodi.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	 If the skin is torn from his genitals during the operation and it is not possible to remove him at that point: Then take him out as soon as you can until nothing remains of this
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	 If only a little or much skin remained from what I just showed you after the operation was done: Then turn to Nodi and ask for him according to the greatest extent that is possible.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If you become tired and only a little skin remains from what I just showed you after the operation is done: Then attach him to your completion by tying them with corrosive or sharp tools: And hold onto the wound above his circumcised area in cold water where it can be easily washed, And take care of any remaining wounds while being careful not to damage anything else, until he becomes healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	 If there is a large vein, then cleanse his two lips and care for him as he was born
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	 If however the pulse is weak or not present at all, then cleanse his nostrils and make him swallow a drop of vinegar every three days until he stops spitting up blood. Then take it back to where it came from through the vein.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	 Concerning the use of instruments in sectioning and perforating.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter 46
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	 The forms of the introducers are three.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	 From them comes the large one and the middle-sized one; from them also comes the small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	 It is necessary to cut down at a distance of four fingers on each side so that they may come together in front.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	 The forms of the instruments are three; one is called a bore, another to perforate and they are perforated; and these are:
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	 From them comes the large one, the middle-sized one, and the small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	 They are connected so that they may be placed together through the apertures and cuts; then take it from where it came out of the bones
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	 And others are rounded, curved, and flexible like the large needle which is made of copper or iron or lead.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	 The best ones among them are those that are made of copper.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	 There are also instruments made of lead that connect so that the holes may be dilated through them; and their thickness is such that they reflect with their roughness when they are rubbed against those who want to reflect light onto them.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	 The third kind is perforated
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	 Because of their length, middle size, and small size depending on the amount of breadth and thickness of the holes and their openings.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	 The shape of the introducers is diverse; there are many forms.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	 Because they have simple shapes such as the ones you mentioned; there are three forms, great, middle-sized and small ones.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	 "And these are knives without handles; and there are three species of them.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	 "And from these come knives with handles; there are three species of them. And from these comes a knife with three handles; there are also three species of them. All of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	 "These are the forms of the scissors used for cutting and scraping; they also have a blade, three species in all, because from them comes 'the big one', 'the middle-sized one', and 'the small one'.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	 "The ends which are suitable for cutting have acute edges; the others do not have sharp ones. They should be placed there so that when they come to the first incision of fear, either the knife is used or not at all, except in case where a weak person needs them to relieve their pain and bring peace.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	 "These are scissors with three species.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	 "They run from the air to the ear; they resemble a radio, through which alcohol is produced; at its extreme end there is hidden a small hole called Spatumilis; it runs towards the inner part and the outer when used, just as you would.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	 "The form of Spatumilis that hide between the fingers near the hole for scraping, they are not felt by the weak ones; and there are three species in all, 'the big one', 'the middle-sized one', and 'the small one'.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	 "The forms of the vessels from which blood flows out; there are three species in all, 'the big one', 'the middle-sized one', and 'the small one'.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	 "They run from the air or from the round vessel towards its length more than that of what is seen; and they are suitable for subtlety.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	 "And it is necessary that the three species of vessels are there for you, big and small; so that when you want to bleed from them with haste near necessity, and then when no medicine is present.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	 "However, you should not use them for bleeding in all parts of the body; but only where they are necessary: as to the arms and thighs, and the limbs and breasts, and the face, and the belly, and the mouth, and the genitals, and similar places, from the skin.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	 "When instruments are removed from them, tools similar to the fingers of fists occur, in accordance with their shape; from which blood flows when flowing out of the place of phlebotomy, or into an incision, or into an artery: and sometimes there are removed from them rounded-shaped according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	 "Of the care of human beings who assimilate breasts in women.
Caput XLVII.	 The last chapter.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	 "When breasts are inflated around people at the time of waking up (i.e., with the onset of sleep), until they resemble breasts in women; and remain as a result, without food.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	 Who therefore rejects this, must be considered to conceal the lunar section in a manner resembling its shape from the line, B to the line, C; after that, wipe away completely the reddened area.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	 "After removing a scab from the body of someone who has been born into medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 "Then join together two lips with sutures and care for him until he is healed.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 "If the breast is pulled downwards and becomes softened because of its own size as happened to women; then it must be found in two upper parts with similar figures of the moon, one of which remains with another at the ends for both sides until a larger line contains the smaller one according to this form from the line, B to the line, C. After that, wipe away any cut between the two lips and apply what we mentioned about sutures and fingers, which is necessary for care, until he is healed.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	 "If you are unable to complete the incision as it should be done, due to discomfort of a nurse or blood flow; then it must be considered that you wipe off the scab with corrosive unguent and release him until he is corroded by what remains after being wiped.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 "Then care for him until he is healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	 "Of the hole made under Titillico
Caput XLVIII.	 The Eighth Head
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	 Those which have fallen from the gall bladder are of a tough variety and contain stones; while those which come out in their moisture content indicate that they have been washed down with fluids.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Therefore let them be extracted with a section of the moon's form from B to L along this line; so that all which is within may be drawn out through it when they have passed entirely and have been held in place by their own weight, then release [them] until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Afterwards let a small quantity of ointment be applied to them, so that they may be released.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	 If the stone had come out of the gall bladder it is to be applied as we have described for removal from above with stones equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	 If however the ulcer is extended to emit pus then apply a cautery [burn] over it as we have described for that which has been removed from above.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	 Of the sections of the stones, caused by artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	 The Ninth Head
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	 When the artery is broken and the skin above it is healed then a great many are lost from the stones; similarly also veins are involved with stones and inflation
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	 The signs which are known by it that there is stones and inflation from artery and veins are: for when the stone occurs through an artery then they are long lasting and accumulated deep within the body; and when you draw a stone with your finger you feel as if he were choking.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	 That which is from veins is round in shape and manifestly upon the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	 The section above a stone is an error and particularly from below the scrotum, anus, neck, and many other places within the body: it is very large error.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	 Therefore let his care be taken with a knife and also from them and what is outside the extremities or head it must be dealt with.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	 "From these veins comes that which is caused by a hole in an artery.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	 Next, make the cut and release it from its sheath after cutting through the artery; then pull it out of clothing until you find it.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Next, insert it under the point and make it penetrate until you reach another side; then tie both ends together with two threads, as shown to you when extracting arteries from time.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	 Next, make a knot between the two ligaments with a slipknot; until all the blood that is within it flows out and the hole closes.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Next, administer care to generate pus; until the ligaments fall off. After that, apply something with oil and do this repeatedly until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	 If the hole is caused by cutting through a vein, then you should hold onto whatever can be pulled out of it with your hand.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	 Next, insert the point under where you held onto your hand with a slipknot; and let it penetrate until you pull it out from another side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	 Next, tie the point with one of the ligaments; according to what I showed you when tying off veins into two parts and using two threads.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	 If you pull out a thread after removing the point from where it was cut off near the artery, then insert another one with another thread under the same sheath at the place of the incision; first tie your thread around four times.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	 Next, dry off the sheath; when it is ready to come out, then remove any excess skin and let go of what is tied to it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	 Finally, apply a powder over that which you submerged into oil, and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Next, administer care using lotions and oils until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	 "From the sheath that was caused by cutting through the arteries.
Caput L.	 The head of Albucasis.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	 As the arrow fell on an artery and vein, similarly it falls on the sciatic nerve; for its fall causes a blow or from excess of effort (strain), as well as many others falling at their destination - the foot, or anywhere where joints are moved together: so is the arrow's fall.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	 The likeness of its body (the arrow) is seen among many things and without pain; when it is drawn with great force, a similar dizziness occurs within him.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	 It is not carried to the depth of the body, it lies under the grasp, and is moved to every part; but does not go back to its former place, or before, nor towards its rear.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	 For what follows from these (the sciatic nerve) must not be drawn with a sword.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	 Indeed the fall of it is a contraction.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	 In that which follows from these (the sciatic nerve) or to its head, find pain with a bruise.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	 If it is the arrow's fall that is light and does not harm you at the root of the arrow, then hold on to him with hooks, but let go from his roots.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If it is great (the arrow), then hold him down with a sling and shake him off; afterward recover him, and gather together the wounds he has inflicted while struggling; then look after him until he is healed.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	 Of the cutting of arrows, which falls into the belly.
Caput LI.	 Head chapter one.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	 Some men many times have fallen into their clothes and other parts of their bodies called Fungalia due to similarity with fungus (mushroom).
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	 Whose roots are soft, and whose heads are large, and whose lips are full
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	 And from these is light; and from them is raised the mighty arrow.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	 Indeed I had heard of men whose roots were very soft and their heads large; there were two such among them which differed from other things by size but not in kind: the white root was different, and both of these had small roots, and they lost moisture from all sides and fell, and the wetness came out of them always.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	 "Make an incision through both of them like X and VIII units and on one side like VI unit. And the operation is performed by making a cut into each of them.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 "In addition to that, blood is expelled near the incision due to its abundance; therefore if you encounter blood, then cauterize it at once.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 "If you see a weak and fearful person after making the cut with a sword, then take out a thread from a plumed arrow in a more deliberate manner; tie it to them as we said before, and let him go free two days later.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	 "Finally add to the sharpness of the arrow.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	 "Do not stop tying an arrow until it pierces and stops by itself without any effort on your part.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	 "If the arrowhead is too large for its roots, then at the moment of cutting into it there will be a certain fear and weakness; especially where this happens on both sides.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	 "However, it may happen that you can make him less violent by making a cut into him.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	 "Finally, cauterize him so that he does not die.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 "And then cure the wound with care.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	 "And be careful not to make an incision into it if its color is dark and has little sense, a faint appearance; for this one is a malignant tumor; and I will come back later with the remembrance of Cancer.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	 "Now cure the wound of Vmbilis.
Caput LII.	 "The second head
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	 "The greatness of Vmbilis comes from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	 "Or by a crack on the upper side; and then comes out of it through the belly, or from the intestines as the case may be depending on what happened with the other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	 "Or by a flow of blood out of veins; or through arteries as may have been preferred.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	 With a sharp knife he opened it up
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	 And if it is due to a cut in the sinew, and there is no third part; then its appearance is similar to that of the body, and it causes pain without any pain felt before; so its location becomes visible after a long time.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	 And if it is due to the exit of an intestine, then its location becomes visible after a long time as we have seen in many cases; more diverse and wider than that one which has left us before.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	 And when you take it in your fingers and hide it from sight; then reveal it again with a loud sound, perhaps there is something accompanying it; and many people will gather around the noise made by its fall, and will be greatly surprised as they have never heard such a thing before.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	 And if it is due to its own moisture and there are no strings or additions to it; then when you take it in your hand it cannot be hidden from view, nor does it become tight nor add anything extra.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	 If it is due to blood and there are no signs of a knot or other obstruction; then when you hold these signs together it appears as if there was some kind of seal on the neck below which blackness can be seen.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	 If it is due to a birth defect in meat; then its appearance is similar to that of a seal, fat and rough, and depending on the amount can vary greatly.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	 If it is due to a cut in the sinew; then its touch is light.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	 And the operation on this is necessary to be considered at that time if the prominence of the belly is due to blood in the arteries or veins; then you must prevent from its cure by prohibiting what is done with it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	 This because of the fear and weakness that it has; just as I told you earlier when discussing seals due to an artery or vein in a chapter.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	 If the prominence of the belly is due to a defect in the bowels or intestines; then you must be certain that it remains firmly held and extended as much as possible until its condition has been cured completely.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	 Then with charcoal all around the belly entirely.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	 "Gently press it down between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	 After that, with a spatula and burnt fat, surround the navel area where you placed it with wax.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	 Extend "postea" outward using a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	 After that, with force and thread/cord tie it tightly to the area of the navel using a firm knot.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	 Release "postea" outward from above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	 If you still hold it tied to the ligament with "postea," then loosen and withdraw from inside of him with your finger (or implement), and expel any excess fluid.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	 But if you encounter a vein or artery instead, surround it with many strands of thread/cord.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	 Then return to your own procedure.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	 And take two hooks and pass them through the two strands tightly; then pass two hooks through the area that you had surrounded with wax in a cruciform manner as you did before.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	 After that, tie "postea" securely to four stakes above the hooks; and if you are too weak, take out one hook and remove the place until the flesh becomes long and falls by itself, or cut it off when it becomes subtle enough to rot away.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 And after that, cure him with whatever is needed from the ointment so he may be healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	 If it was from flesh or moisture on his navel, then you should tie "postea" as we described before.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	 And if you remove the blood/moisture that has been caught by you inside of him, return to your own procedure.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	 And after that, cure him with whatever is needed from the place so he may be healed.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	 End of curing procedure.
Caput LIII.	 Head 33.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	 I have described for you the species of Cancer and how the path to curing him with medicine proceeds; also cautioning against using iron when curing him because it might cause ulcers; moreover, we spoke about generating Cancer in the matrix and guarding against curing his disease.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	 "Others said that sometimes when cancer is present at a location where it can be removed; just as the cancer found in breasts or in limbs and other places from which it was taken out by pulling them apart, especially when it begins to grow up.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	 "If a large one occurs before you are aware of it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	 "I was unable to heal that person; nor did I see anyone else who had been healed from that before me.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	 "The operation on it is as we described; but the person who was operated upon sometimes became weaker from black bile.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	 "Then a leech should be applied to him with visible swelling, while he is being operated upon.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	 "Then prepare the patient for the preparation, where it will take place during the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	 "Then apply a leech to its wounds while you are operating on him.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	 "Afterwards you should hold him by all four limbs with both hands, according to the prescription; until nothing remains from his roots; and let the blood run out or cut it off quickly and cleanly yourself, as much as possible, using your hand; or if that is not possible there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 "If the flow of the large blood stream becomes contrary to you from cutting off an artery; or by another way; then burn that place with fire until the blood stops flowing.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 "Then cure him while still being prepared for treatment, until he is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	 "Of hydrotherapy.
Caput LIIII.	 "Chapter 14
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	 "We have finished discussing the types of hydrotherapy and how it works; but we also need to discuss its signs and its treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	 "That which is treated by iron can only be the type of asclepias (the cure for poisoning); and not the other types, such as those for tympanitis or hyposarcus.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	 "When you have been treated with that kind of hydrotherapy; but the treatment has not helped you; then consider this.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	 "Having already been caused by weakness or another infirmity other than Hydropism, if he is in the presence of a metal (i.e., an instrument), either solution from within him must be sought with water; otherwise there will be no remedy at all.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	 "But if you encounter a man who is overwhelmed by his strength and there is no other weakness (other than Hydropism), then the remedy must be sought within him, as if he were a child; otherwise it will not work at all.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	 "Then take the phlegmatic humor in this way.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	 "The cold and moist humors are sharp, prolonged, and have a short duration like phlegm.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	 "However, there is some weakness that comes quickly and lasts only a short time, such that it does not pass through him even in the course of surgery to the intestines.
Deinde considera.	 "Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	 "If the generation of Hydropism is from the intestines, then you should stretch as much as possible with a cut away from the navel and three fingers wide towards his lower abdomen.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	 "If it is generated by weakness of the liver, then your cut should be from the left side with three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	 "And if it is generated by weakness of the spleen, then the cut should be on the right side; and it is not necessary that he cuts to the left above where a weak man leans, so as not to bring additional strength to a weaker place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	 "Then perforate him with an instrument when you have made your incision completely.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	 "Then insert it into the incision and take hold of his hand with the phlegmatic humor between the incision; and if you are pulling him out as though you were drawing a sword (i.e., forcefully), then let its amount be that of a finger, or around this part.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	 "Then perforate the phlegmatic humor until it reaches a vacuum; and there is water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	 Afterward remove it and insert it into the hole with its form
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	 It is similar to the cannula: it can be inserted from an artery or vein, air-tight; at its lower part there are two foramina and three holes with one foramen each on opposite sides of the cannula. The cannula's extremity is incised according to the manner of a clamp incision so that its upper end remains open.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	 When the cannula is withdrawn from water then immediately it descends over the instrument so that half of its length goes into water at a time.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	 If you withdraw from water more than half of its length is required then the patient may die due to the loss of vital life force (respiration) or it may collapse suddenly, possibly causing death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	 Indeed the withdrawal of water should be according to its length and also based on the nature of its pulse (heart beat). Also based on the goodness of it.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	 Afterward remove the instrument and hold onto the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	 This is because it must be withdrawn promptly to prevent cutting the hole which holds onto its tip so that you can remove it according to this method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	 Afterward repeat the process on another day if you find it difficult to tolerate being without water and withdraw even half of its length from water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	 Do this for a few days without any fear or worry until it doesn't remain in water anymore.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	 If you find it difficult to tolerate being without water and you withdraw a great deal of it from water then be sure to immerse the instrument into hot water (a hot bath) immediately after withdrawal so that he may sweat, cleanse himself with much water and sun, and expectorate over a cloth. Then make certain to apply hot compresses on his stomach before bed and repeat this process until you feel better and you burn off the excess of it by spitting out or sneezing when necessary.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	 For the care of infants who are born in places that are not perforated with urine holes for them.
Caput LV.	 The Head (of a person).
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	 When someone takes an infant from their mother and the head of that infant is not perforated or is a narrow opening (foramen), or it's not positioned properly.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, one should help with a perforation as soon as possible and with the help of delicate instruments while giving birth to prevent complications in this manner.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then put a thin iron rod into the narrow opening (foramen) and tie it; keep holding it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	 If urine is excreted from the wound then remove that immediately to prevent infection
Deinde reduc ipsum.	 Then reduce it (the tie).
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	 If a thin iron rod was not put in then urine coming from above the wound cannot get into that wound.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	 The one whose opening is narrow should be helped with a thin iron rod and held for many days until it expands (is dilated).
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	 Those who have their opening not positioned properly are helped by tying them to the bed or holding them for three or four days (to allow swelling of the wound to bring it back into place).
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	 This is because when the infant is born then there's a narrow opening in the top of its head; so it cannot pass through and until it reaches with its hand to above.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	 Neither the generation nor the sperm can pass through a narrow opening (foramen) in this manner; there's also a risk of infection.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	 The method of helping is as follows: lay him on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	 Then extend the left hand of his head to the rear with a gentle movement and then strike it from its place (the foramen) by using force; as you would hit something hard, or when you pull the skin, so that medium enters into the middle of the skull where it should be, and let's drop (dilate?) the opening in the middle according to what is necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	 And if you see blood flow towards your surgical operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 It often happens that the head gets damaged or torn off during surgery.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 "If a wound is treated with its own blood and care, it will heal.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	 Diseases that occur on the head, face, neck, eyes, nose, and ears
Caput LVI.	 Sixth part of the body
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	 Many diseases occur on this particular part of the body and its fat is prominent (meaning it has a large amount of fat).
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	 And among these are both good and bad ones.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	 Therefore, it is necessary to suspend with a subtle incision, remove that part of the body entirely.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	 Afterwards, pour over it from above with an Egyptian unguent (ointment).
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	 And then care for it with the unguent until it is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	 If Albaster is bad and has putrefaction as a result of the incision, then it is necessary to administer a cautery after making the incision both on him (the affected area) and also on his roots.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	 If the Albaster is on the head of someone else and not circumcised (i.e., has no prepuce), then you should remove it first and afterwards cure what was previously mentioned; for if you cure both at the same time, they will never become secure because one may remain outside while the other remains inside.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	 Diseases also occur on testicles and scrotum, discoloration (nigredo) and corruption.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	 Therefore it is necessary to cut off whatever has already become black or corrupted as well as what will be corrupted and putrefaction.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	 Afterwards pour over it from above with a mixture of flour, the powder of seeds and herbs as well as dry grasses (used for binding).
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 And then care for it using what is left of your treatment until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	 If a bleeding occurs from the flow of blood, then administer the lunar cautery in this way.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	 A cautery is suitable for two purposes at once; namely for bleeding and when a wound becomes corrupted (putrid).
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	 "If a man's head is split open and destroyed during the same hour/moment, then it would be necessary to quickly introduce (put?) an iron bar inside his mouth, that he might bite down on it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	 "If a blow strikes the head of a man and this does not lead to death (immediately), but if it is caused by an injury or fall from above, then the result could be: that he should put something sharp into his mouth in order for him to bite down on it.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	 "If discerning the cause is difficult, then one should insert something sharp from his head and from that which causes it.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	 "This could be because the cause of damage is subtle or cleverly hidden.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	 "Then you must separate between the blow and the head of the man with a subtle cloth that has already been soaked in cold water so they do not stick together anymore.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	 "Then he should be treated using an astringent solution until it is consolidated again.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	 "Regarding the nourishment of children and correction from their mistakes.
Caput LVII.	 "Head 72.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	 "The circumcision is not a solution to the continuity of life as other wounds are: however if it comes from our operation, desire and use must be theirs, that they may become better and worse for them.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	 "Therefore I say that the ancients did not write about circumcision in any of their books because they are not used according to their laws and it is only what we acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	 "This is because I have learned to use a greater part of the artifices and phlebotomists in nourishing children, circumcising with new cloths and with wounds; they are also used when intoxicated, tied up with thread or nails, and when cutting down on horns.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	 "And I have already tried all these methods, except for using better phlebotomists and tying up with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	 When the skin is being washed with vinegar, many times it gets peeled off
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	 The skin has two tunics when it is peeled off; hence the upper tunic gets incised while the lower one remains intact; as a result of this there will be an incision in both, and future pain
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	 And when washing is done with vinegar (or through the use of a nail), that is, finger-nails, incisions do not occur on the fingertips of men; because possibly they get injured at their holes.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	 However when washing is done with a nail (or possibly due to iron), it can damage your operation; and the skin of children is naturally fragile, so many are born in this way, therefore I have heard that.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	 Washing with hooks or threads brings about a good experience for me; because the incisions are proportionate to them; so that the pain which is superior corresponds to that of inferior.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	 So when your hand is washed with two hooks that correspond to one incision of the operation at once and there occurs a compression similar figure which contains the skin from all sides without any mistake.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 The mode of your operation is specific to what you are doing especially the child if it is from those who understand more than you do not make unless you tie a thread in its hole and release it until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	 And afterwards enjoy the child's laughter as much as possible from what intelligence has received him.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	 Afterwards keep the child standing between your hands upright not sitting down; and hidden hooks on your hand or under your foot so that he cannot see them all at once nor anything from an instrument.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	 Afterwards put your hand into his hole and fill the skin until its head goes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	 Afterwards wash her with what has been added to this sorrow.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	 In one groove two fingers are placed
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	 The inferior groove is made greater than the second ligament
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	 Then place your index finger and thumb in the inferior groove with a good grip on the ligaments below it, and strike between the two ligaments.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	 And then remove the head of the needle above or to one side.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then drain the blood slowly (for it is better), and lay a poult on top of it; and place the poult made from the skin in which the ulcer has been cooked with saffron oil over that part where the poult was applied: And remove him to another day, and take care of him with the same care as before until he recovers.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	 This is how you make a form suitable for making holes in it.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	 There are two extremities and incidents of them; so that the end should not be moved in these limbs towards the claw; And the length of the pair of fingers is equal to each other as well as the length of both hands.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	 A mistake that falls in making holes is this one; because if a part of his skin has been broken away completely or some part of him at the time of cutting.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	 Therefore you should stretch it out with your finger ahead of when you're making the hole; and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	 If you can't hold on to him with your finger then remove him with a blade and cut off his head.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	 If after three days the swelling of the finger has not subsided and is still inflamed beneath the claw; then remove it until it subsides from heat or with ease, and cut off his head.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	 It won't be removed for him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	 Therefore take care of it with what has cured the ulcer from the poult that we mentioned in our work on the poult; and if you cut off more than the length of his finger above then add to its height as well, do not hurt him further.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 "Healing [it], until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	 From pressing the Vena cava into a tube
Caput LVIII.	 The eighty-third head
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	 Retention of the urine is made into a tube by pressing it into a tube or by freezing with ice, blood, pus, or fleshly matter; and similarly from these as we have described in our manner of treatment, using an appropriate means to discharge them.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	 And if the Vena does not yield to being pressed into a tube, or it is due to retention of the flesh in his throat that has become a tube; then let him lie prone on his stomach until he is cured from his illness
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	 Then they will place both his feet above his back and stretch out the upper part of his chest towards him, and he will draw in breath as much as is possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	 He then proceeds to expel the flesh from behind by breathing it out towards his back; and the Vena yields.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	 If it is not successful with him as we have described and the body lies above the sick person; then let you administer the removal of his flesh by an instrument called a syringe, its shape being like that of a needle for drawing out air from the thumb, long and resembling a palm in half. And there should be a very small one made just for him on top of his head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	 The mode of the exit of the Vena is by itself through him, taking hold of a doubled thread and binding it tight with ligature; then you will introduce the end into the lower part of the syringe until he reaches its extremity; and if there should be any superfluity from the lanam or flesh, bring that to the mouth with force like this.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	 Then you take the syringe and oil or butter it; or if there is nothing else, just cover him with sand and apply a tube to his mouth, and bind up the flesh of his neck from above downwards towards his chest, and fill in the eyes and ears with oil as warm as possible, and then water to warm them.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	 And then inserting a sheath made of ivory along with its help and facilitating it towards the root of the limb
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	 Then place both ends on either side of the joint.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	 Then roll the sheath down inside and secure it to the bone by passing a cord through an opening made for that purpose on each end of the sheath: only then can you begin to move the joint towards its natural position or rest, provided your strength is sufficient to maintain this movement until the desired effect has been achieved.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	 Then extend cord gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	 The vein follows the thread.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	 Then remove the vein and guide it through a hole made for that purpose on the sheath to be pulled out gently: repeat this until the desired effect is achieved and maintained by strength.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	 With respect to the quality of the sheath used for phlebotomy with the Clexys system.
Caput LIX.	 The head is 35cm or approximately 12 inches long.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	 When a cut occurs on the sheath or blood coagulates within it, or if pus accumulates there, and you wish to remove water and medicines from inside it: then use this instrument which is called Clexys and these are its forms.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	 It is mute.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	 Inside it are three holes: two on one side and one on the other as you would expect.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	 And the location where it is applied should be proportional to the amount which holds it without addition but only for as long as you hold on to it until something is drawn out from moisture: and when it is being pulled towards a long distance, with that same thing expel all moisture off of it; after this manner performed by the Clexys system.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	 When you then pull the moisture out of it, insert the extremity of Clexys into the moisture and draw with it what was pulling towards its highest point: for the moisture is drawn from around the sheath of Clexys.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	 After making an incision in his forearm as described earlier, we proceed with the needle.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	 After moistening him as previously mentioned, and when moisture is brought to his lips so that he feels refreshed at once, in this manner the weakness passes away from him
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	 With a small sponge soaked with water, we apply it to the wound.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	 Either gold or silver may be used for his head; if its top is similar in size to a small bowl and there is space beneath it for the nasal bone to fit through, then the incision should follow this path.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	 After moistening the sponge as described earlier and placing it on the wound, we apply pressure with it to cleanse the wound.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	 After tying off both nasal bones with a strong thread, and then applying heat to increase the moisture even more than fire can provide.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	 After making an incision with the sponge as described earlier, after wrapping your hand tightly around it with a decent grip and applying moisture to that area so he feels refreshed, until he feels weakness has passed and moisture is on his lips already.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	 If there's no sponge available right now, take a flat dish instead and make it into a circle by folding it in half; then you should scrape off all the excess material from around its edges so that only what remains is smooth on both sides.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	 After inserting a strong thread through those holes as it runs down, similarly.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	 After completing the circle (as previously described), when you place that which is wet from moisture and oil on it...
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	 After tying off the wound as previously mentioned with a strong thread attached to an instrument, you should proceed similarly by applying it as if you were using the sponge and hand from before until moisture is on his lips already.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	 With removal of the stone (from previous passage).
Caput LX.	 Size 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	 I said, "We have spoken about the species of the stone and its care with remedies; I also mentioned distinguishing between the generated stone in the urine and the stone itself; signs for both are described; I mentioned that the stone should be placed into which hand and section to follow so it can fit through. And a stone is generated from this place.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	 "I declare that the stone (lapis) given birth to a well, it injured most of the children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	 And it is from signs of him that urine flows out of the well similarly to water's subtleties: and it appears white foam, and shakes your own limb, and struggles with it, and many times falls.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	 Then, they give birth to him with urine of the well among many, when he is angry or annoyed.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	 The injury of children from him often occurs in 14 years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	 It is difficult for old people.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	 However, among the young it is middle-aged, but for whom the stone of lapis is greater, care (curation) is easier; and if small, then more economical care for these.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	 Therefore when we come to the care of purification, it is first necessary, so that we cleanse the sick with a clister (a type of sponge), which has removed all dirt from the stone inside its intestines; and indeed sometimes this stone forbids the movement of Lapis for investigation.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	 Then the sick is received with his feet, and is rolled up, and moved towards the lower part; so that the Lapis descends to the bottom of the well, or sprays from high places sometimes.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	 Then put him on his back between your hands, and place his feet under a cross of these, so that the well is completely filled towards the lower part.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	 Then carry it away, and take it from outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	 If therefore you find the Lapis in space (in storage), then immediately with a division above him/it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	 If it does not come under your hand entirely, then you must take the thumb of the left hand with olive oil, if the sick is a child; or the middle finger, if he/it has been filled completely by a young person, and insert him into his own mouth: and carry away from the Lapis until it remains below your finger. And quickly turn him down to the bottom of the well.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	 "Then place the finger on top of it with your own finger and urge it towards the external part against which section is to be made; then take hold of the minister with the other hand as if you are trying to lift him up, so that his thumb presses downward upon the testicle from below. And when another minister is taken by the left hand, press down upon the testicles with your right hand in order to remove the cut skin beneath them.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	 "Then introduce a spike which has this form.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	 "Then find where it is between the anus and testicles, but not in the middle; to the left side you perform the incision as shown above on the stone, your finger into the anus should be placed; then make an outward cut so that there is both a wide and narrow cut depending on how much lapides can escape from this. Do not let it out for too long or the patient may suffer.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	 "If your finger is trapped inside the anus during the incision and cannot be easily removed without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	 "You know that for the lapides there are angles and borders which make it difficult to remove him because of this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	 "And from him you have a narrow one similar in shape to the penis but fat; and he can be easily removed by him.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	 "Therefore add an angle and border into the incision.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	 "If you cannot remove him easily in that way, then have the fingers above him; or with a tighter grasp and downward gesture towards his extremity as though it were the moon, which holds the lapides tightly and does not let go of them; or use an instrument below him with great delicacy to reach beneath him.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	 "If you cannot do so from above but want to try something else: then make a larger opening in the meantime.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	 "But if he bleeds or is injured and you let him go with your words...
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	 "And if the lapide is larger than one, then first press it greatly towards the mouth.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	 "Then make an incision above him.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	 After cutting off a vein after that (i.e., at this point), proceed as you would if there were two of them.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	 If it is large in size, then ignorance occurs when cutting off a major vein above the cut section
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	 Because it happened to one of two things that could happen to him - either he would die or the vein would be severed by a strong urine stream - but for this reason, the place where it was cut off is not closed up completely.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	 Indeed, administration of its expulsion leads to his departure - either through a rupture of its veins with the fingers or through removal from outside forcefully.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	 After completing your operation then you have the task of removing a thrombus or clot from it and after that you must lubricate its surface with oil (olive oil) or wine to make sure there are no abrasions, even if they're minor ones. And after that you should tie a bandage soaked in olive oil or wine over it to prevent any frostbite.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	 Then he must lie flat on his back, and not just rest the affected limb - for a period of three days.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	 After you have finished with him then soak up any remaining liquid (oil) from the place using water or olive oil
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	 Then after having treated it with unguents of both types - one made from dragon's blood and another from hyssop (a plant) - until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	 If however it happened to have cold blood added and become burned - just as if frozen blood had been poured into a vessel and urine was forbidden from coming out of that place - then after this knowledge is gained, the fact that it occurred because of the flow of blood with urine should be known.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	 Then you put your finger into its opening and extract his blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	 If any urine is left over it causes the vessel to be corrupted or cause decay in him.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	 Then apply a dressing with vinegar and water to it until everything that could have come from the treatment is done.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	 And then care should be taken of its care during all hours until two feet and a mattress are placed over the area as part of medical treatment.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	 If a stone is smooth and fits into the vein, it becomes a thrombus when it stays there, and prevents the veins from death. The care for this is to describe it before removing it from its location
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	 I have already tried that procedure after examining it
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	 It is a needle with an iron ferrule, which has this shape: a triangle at the tip and fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	 Then take a thread and tie it under the stone to prevent slipping off of the vein.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	 Then insert the needle into your hand with ease and tie it to the stone so that it does not slip off of the vein. Then take the thread you used for this purpose out of the stone very quickly using only one hand: And fix it in its place, until the needle penetrates completely through to another part of itself: And once you have done that, then remove the perforation from your hand and let the needle penetrate into the other part of itself.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	 The urine is immediately released.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	 Then use your other hand to remove the thread that remained from the vein on the outside part of it.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	 It breaks off and is released with urine, and heals the injured one.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	 If you are unable to perform this procedure for some reason, tie the thread under the stone and another one above it.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	 Then dry up over the stone between the two tied threads.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	 Remove it from there
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	 Afterwards, remove one of the ligatures and thaw out the frozen blood that flowed into the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	 It is not necessary to tie the thread under the stone unless you want it to prevent slipping off of the vein: and remove one of the ligatures above it, unless when you have tied a second one after removing it from the stones, it slides back into its place on your skin and ties up the wound. And because of this reason, it is necessary for you to tie that upper thread so that it slides back down towards the other part (of itself), and ties up the wound like we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	 From extracting the woman's nipple
Caput LXI.	 The 10th book of surgery
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	 A wound is formed by the nipple
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	 If a man should accidentally touch them nipples, then it is difficult care for that, and is prohibited due to many reasons
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	 The reason why the woman's nipple is very sensitive to a man's touch.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	 And secondly, because if you touch a woman who has given herself medical treatment when she is pure or with the help of her husband.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	 The third reason why a man's touch on a woman is delicate, especially when it comes to surgery with his hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	 The fourth reason for the delicacy of the nipple is because the cutting of deep incision and there is fear in that place.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	 If a necessity forces you to do this, then it's recommended that you touch the woman with good knowledge of medicine and surgery, otherwise you will only be injured.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	 If the woman is pregnant at that time, ask for a doctor of medicine who is subtle and has experience with childbirth, or a woman who has studied this subject well: do so therefore, and especially to her, so that she can do everything that may happen as a result of interrogation over the nipple.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	 The first reason is to ask if there's a man present when touching the woman's nipple; then you must put your finger into her anus and squeeze on it.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	 If he did that, hold his hand with your left hand over her vagina and ask for the nipple while squeezing it hard.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	 If he did that to the nipple, it's recommended that you quickly move him away from the vagina opening towards the lower part of his body with all your strength, until he reaches his groin.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	 Then take him by the hand over to the opposite side of his buttocks towards the groin with all your strength, from where you prepare him and put the nipple on that part; and do not remove his finger from it, holding onto it under it; and the incision is made first of all.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	 "Then the beam was placed upon that cut.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	 If it felt like a stone, then he added to the second cut according to its size as much as needed from this stone.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	 And you know that stones vary greatly in size and shape.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	 But this is what a stone can be: short or tall; thin or rough; smooth or jagged; long or round, depending on how it has grown branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	 Therefore you know the kind of stone by its effect upon that which is struck with it, so that from this you can understand what sort of a stone was used in order to strike him.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If it then struck blood into you, immediately apply pressure at the place where it hit you and hold it there until the bleeding stops.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	 Then return to your surgery, until the stone is removed; and do as I advised you about the extraction of stones from the body, so that you may use them to help with your surgery.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	 If it then strikes you with a flow of blood and you know that the expulsion is from an artery that has been cut; then place a sponge upon the spot, and firmly tie him tightly around the sponge with something decent to hold it in place: do not let go of the stone itself or remove it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	 And if you are a woman who is weak.
Deinde cura uulnus.	 In that case, care for her as would be expected in one who has been hurt by the stone of another person's hand (i.e., a criminal).
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	 After you have become aware that the blood flow has ceased and the spot is rotting (putrefying), then return to your surgery until the stone is removed.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	 "To cut above a hernia.
Caput LXII.	 End of the book
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	 A ramus is not a ramus without humidity and dryness; for it has become a lump of moisture below the scrotum, which is called a ramus.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	 Sometimes it is on its own in the scrotum, which nature has prepared for him in a small part; until then he must suffer this, which we have called another ramus and was cut skin between them, but it doesn't happen often.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	 The generation of this type of penis is by weakness which caused testicles: where it comes to them this matter
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	 And sometimes happens from a blow to the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	 These become many colors due to moisture.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	 Or its color may be from the decline of veins to a certain color, or it is red with blood, or dirty and black, or it is white and wet, or something else that I've mentioned earlier.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	 The signs by which the combination of water is known are these ones.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	 If it is at the base white as we said then it is rounded in length so that it resembles a hoop more than anything else, and you do not see the testicles because the moisture surrounds them from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	 If the moisture is only at its own base then it is rounded with half of that length and because of this man thinks that it is something else.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	 If the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and its base then it collapses under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	 When you are aware that colors come from moisture, then experience a color of moisture when moistening the penis with intromission as a square whose shape precedes it.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	 Therefore considering what has been mentioned earlier about the act of intromission, remember that there is something between itself and its base.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	 When we come to the cure then it is necessary that he makes a small cut with iron so that he can drain if possible, and see the body of him full
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	 Then let him hang it over his back over another part slightly while laying on many towels.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	 Then let him sit on the left side of it and raise his right arm so that he may sit to the other side who extends his hand towards one of the two sides of the scrotum and towards the side of the abdomen.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	 Then take a narrow strip of dry skin from the middle lengthways through towards the foreskin; and make a cut according to an equal line that has divided the skin of the testicles, until it reaches down to the base which is white: then wipe him off carefully observing or doing what you want with this for drying him completely: be careful in your wiping so as not to damage his part which is held up by more than one finger. And examine and observe closely with a view towards quantity that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	 Indeed, make a full incision with water and remove all of it
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	 Then, make a section between the two lips with a sickle-like instrument and extend it to the top; do not cut through the testicle that is comprehended. And if you can make an incision anywhere on this part or all at once or in small pieces, as long as it's possible for you, whether completely or partially, but especially carefully observe its subtle length.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	 If you do not thoroughly examine the incision, there will be no safety, and water may come out of it.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	 However, if you proceed to cut off your own part during the time of your operations; then when you have finished making the incision, reduce it down.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	 Then join the two lips and sew up the testicle with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	 And then care for it as you would for any other part of the body to ensure that it heals properly.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	 If there is a corruption or damage from other parts of the body that might affect it, then it should be treated with similar means as those used for its support and holding back blood flow.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then remove the testicle along with the supporting device; thereafter care for it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	 If the water is gathered into two parts then you know there are two roots; therefore dry the other part as carefully as you did for the first one.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	 If it becomes equal to you so that an operation can be done in one go, then proceed; and afterward stop the flow of blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	 Then insert a soaked thread into the sectioned part with olive oil or heated olive oil; and put another soaked piece on which you had placed it in wine and olive oil above both testicles; expand it across two testicles so that its top is above both of them, and put above double folds, they are wrinkled: and sew these up with a thread holding six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	 Then two pieces of cloth are laid out and stretched; they are applied as described above; the extremities from which it was taken or soaked thread is added on to: and all parts are gathered up with a stitch at the lower end of the arms, one extremity reaches over towards the head until its top reaches to the back, and another goes towards the front chest area. And two of them reach below both hips; two others go above both buttocks, and all the pieces are gathered together in total for the lower part of the body.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	 "And sometimes by artificial means this ram is heated with cautery and the section of the skin with a knife; then it is as if you applied a subtle cautery, and remove with that the testicle's skin; then it burns in such way as we have seen: until when it is opened up there remains a burning cautery.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	 "Greek letters are to be assimilated
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	 "Then cut it with that and it burns until all the moisture has evaporated.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	 "Then extend that and with a subtle cautery ignite it; then cut off in the way you can according to what is possible for you until all of its parts are removed.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	 "And let there be no contact between the eye and fire.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	 "You know that this operation is better, longer-lasting than blood flow, and better than the operation with cutting.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	 "If it is contrary to you during the time of cutting or heating up with a hot cautery, blood flow, or something else: then take care that what goes against you from this method with the care which was given to him according to what has been stated.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	 "If the patient is timid and does not expect this operation because of its horror; then administer a perforation according to what I say that one:" and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 "When you learn from this what we have said about the water ram and its function; then it is necessary that you leave the patient in a raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	 "Then cut off at the lower part of his body with a thin side; and set a perforation according to the length of his body; it should be an opening wide enough for all water to flow through.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 "Then put on the place of the wound; bind it up and let it be so that the remaining water flows through; then take care of him until he is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	 "If the escape of water is contrary during the time when you perforate it; and not that one alone unless there is a white membrane which prevents the exit of water from its hole, and does not allow the water to leave: then take care that you insert in the wound either a small rod with which the water can be removed through the pores of its form or some device similar.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	 "Know that water is released after six months, either directly after them.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	 "Therefore, it should be administered then in the same manner as before and on the day following his illness he will pass away.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	 "Of the treatment of a sick rabbit.
Caput LXIII.	 Chapter 63
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	 "Know that the removal of this rabbit from its cage is attended by fear and can lead to death in multiple ways.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	 "And you shall take him away with a dish of food.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	 "I will remember the surgery performed on it and make a memorial plaque for it.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	 "Therefore I say that many wounds occur on the bodies of such animals and from which their testicles are composed. And so it happens by multiple causes.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	 "Or due to an acute or caustic substance that is poured onto them.
Aut ex percussione.	 "Or by a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	 "The wounds on their bodies are colored like the body and do not feel pain. They are ugly scars.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	 "And sometimes it is a scar of stone whose color is dark and does not feel to him.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	 "Or sometimes from a rupture of an artery or a swelling in the ears. Like its memory before it goes away either by an overflow of fluids.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	 "What is therefore due to them from a rupture of an artery is known through the feeling of their wounds when you compress them with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	 "And it should not be so that you touch him again quickly.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	 "That is due to an overflow of fluids but does not come out when you press it with your fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	 "And it is possible for the surgeon to make an incision into this specimen and into the rest of their bodies as well. And then it should be cut out the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	 "Then stretch it out on top and then take him away with a white cloth to the side or wherever you want to free the ropes from and tie them up tightly so that they do not slip off when removing this specimen.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	 If a bandage is applied over these cut flesh wounds then it should be pulled and pushed
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	 If a siphon is inserted between something or within the urine outlet, then it should be removed entirely with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	 If there is a cut on the flesh next to where the bandage was applied, then it should be removed entirely with a round incision and pulled out as well.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Once your operation is complete, bind a band of wool soaked in fresh goat's milk and honey around the wound to care for it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	 The cure for wounds by the ram's horn
Caput LXIIII.	 64.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	 The mouth is opened with a similar tool, gently loosening the testicles and making movement difficult for those who are weak or ill, and walking motion can also be performed.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And in the treatment of this injury there is a fear because of what came before it that has been remembered.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	 It should be done according to how they performed the surgery first.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 Therefore I say that it is necessary for you to let a weak person rest on an elevated bed.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	 After this, pull the testicles down towards the lower part of the body
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	 After this hold on to the testicles with your fingers and urine nearby, holding it with another hand so that someone else can stretch it out using a stretched cloth
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	 After this cut the testicles downwards and upwards at an acute angle with a sharp blade so that they can be grasped by someone else.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Afterwards clean it thoroughly all over as you have been instructed to do when removing arteries from the body.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	 Afterwards bind it with a double thread in the parts where there is a cut and bind it again in the last part of those who have made the cut.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	 Afterwards dry it in the middle with a straight cut according to its length and remove what is covered by wet and dirty fluids.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	 After removing ulcers and caring for wounds that are healing, you should stimulate the glans of the penis so that it rises up, until it reaches its natural position while eating.
Non est enim malum per illud.	 It is not a bad thing because of this
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	 If all the wounds are cured, then it is necessary to extract the glans from the wound so that no food reaches them because of the incision, and they should be left to heal or ascend, depending on how badly injured they were.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	 Of the cure for rectal ulcers.
Caput LXV.	 Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	 The remedy for rectal ulcers is to make a cut that extends across the anus, cutting into both buttocks at one end and then entering through the rectum on the other end.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	 Because of this, the intestines fall down from it towards one penis.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	 And the cut is either made in the anus or through its extent.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	 These two types of injuries occur from different causes, such as the impact or the blow, the cut or the shout, the heavy kick or the hard push back down again.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	 The mark is when it's made through the extent of the anus.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	 It happens quickly when it is long in time and not immediately; the sign was made equally with the depth of the anus but less so than its width, because the anus compressed the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	 The mark on its way out is made when it's done through the cut in the anus; because of that immediate pain and severe sorrow happens immediately after making it, but then it differs greatly from appearing under the skin to being pushed outwards towards the outside of the anus.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	 Sometimes with a hernia and the intestine is called "ramex" or a bladder hernia; sometimes it occurs when there is heaviness in the urine.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	 Sometimes it runs into a bladder while the intestines are moving; and then it is held there, because of this pain happens especially when it pushes forward or back towards its own size.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	 "And while dealing with the fear of specialists, it is necessary that there be a cause to act.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	 The method of surgery consists in making the wound made by one specialist so that he can reduce the intestine with his own hand if it is delivered back.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	 Afterwards, put yourself on top of him and take hold of his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	 Afterwards extend the wound following the wound towards the upper part and dry all the wounds completely in length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	 Afterwards place him with two separate cuts on the thighs towards opening the cut together with them and make a cut according to the quantity that is possible so it can be made out of this way
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	 Afterwards remove the parts below the thigh until when it is drawn out of the white phallus, after that put your finger (in) him who follows the thigh, into him who is between the two slits and completely with him towards the rear part.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	 Afterwards move the hand on the right to the inside of the thigh and with this extended the slit towards the top, with the left hand and take hold of him at the part of the section and close up from the minister, so that it extends to the top: and you solve completely towards the rear solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	 And ask with your fingers not let anything go out of the intestine into the white phallus and hard one.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	 If something comes from it, then pull him towards the lower part.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	 Afterwards take hold of the thick one in which there are ten hairpieces made by law and put her at the back slit, that is, the tunic which is below the thigh following the section: afterwards cut the extremities from the hairpiece until four pieces are left.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	 Afterwards arrange some of them above others with a figure that is in the shape of the cross and bind him together to those who are mentioned because they are below the thigh ligament, until nothing can be moved from these which feed them into them something: so that it does not become hot from there.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	 Second ligature is placed after first ligature, leaving a gap between them of two fingers' length
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	 Then remove the second ligature from its sheath as mentioned earlier, placing it below where you made an incision for removing the testicles; measure its length by touching your fingers together in a way that leaves a space of two finger lengths; and then make a complete cut to release this ligament.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	 After the skin of the testicles has been cut and blood flows out, you will see it as we described earlier.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	 Then administer a submerged needle into an olive oil container, then insert this into the incision; and then administer the ligature we previously described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	 And when you have burned the sheath of that which we mentioned earlier after making an incision into it while fearing the flow of blood
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 That many things happen.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	 Then remove the ligature until it is complete in its own way.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	 If something delays his situation (i.e., the blood flow stops), then apply a warm compress over him and put on top of it that which we mentioned earlier until he dies.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	 Then after removing the needle from the wound and the ligature is complete, stop caring for both.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	 Farewell to the rope
Caput LXVI.	 End of Document
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	 I did not see anyone who was removed from caring for him with a fire.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	 And the first ones said that it happens just like what we described earlier with the rope and the wick.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 Which is that the flame goes above and comes down quickly after cutting it over them; then stop in the middle to dry out; care for him as we described earlier until he dies; and lastly care for his wounds according to what we mentioned before until they are healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	 Of the disruption that occurs in the genitals.
Caput LXVII.	 End of Document
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	 When the rupture occurs in the genitals as we mentioned earlier and it leads to a place where nothing comes out of the intestines; or if it goes down into the testicles but only then is that limited, returning inside every hole: if the time for urine stays too long with her, an incision is made within the sheath until the bowels come out of the sheath.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	 "It [i.e., a fistula] is caused by an extension of the septum as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	 "That is because it extends the septum; then it becomes softened and the place opens up and is healed.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	 "Its care is like that of its narration, as we have said before.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	 "And sometimes it is treated with a knife according to this manner; and when healed, let the sick one lie on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	 "Then dry up the place of rupture according to our previous explanation; by making a cut across it at right angles and through its width, with three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	 "Then close the septum as we have said before; until when it is revealed and is found to be white under your finger which follows after.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	 "Then take a needle, and put it into the place of the septum as we have said before; and gently press towards its deepest part in the body.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	 "Then take two stitches of the septum above the extremity of your finger from it; and bind one of them with another; then cut off the extremity of your finger.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	 "And do not cut all at once, nor stretch out with force; neither do anything else as we have taught you about the preparation of the intestines.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	 "Then cure that by our manner of caring for veins.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	 "As we have taught you before when the vein is cut; make it moist and rest the wound until it heals together again.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	 "The septum as a result of this contraction does not become bigger than its rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	 "The cautery is better at that place because it is more closely related to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	 "Of the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	 The following text does not seem to have a clear meaning. What do you suggest I do with it?
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	 "The skin of the testicles becomes softened on certain men due to the softening of the flesh which lies between them; and is changed by it.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	 Therefore it is necessary for him who is requested to make a vein out of his own flesh and to make an incision through the softened skin on top of the normal one.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	 Then two lips with a seam are sewn together along with this: if there is an excess of the softened skin in three stitches or four, and firm sutures.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	 Then make an incision between the seams.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	 After curing and treating the wounds of others as much as necessary, until they are healed completely, and then the stitches will fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	 Of castration.
Caput LXIX.	 Chapter 69.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	 However, the castration is excluded from our law and it was permitted for me that I should not remember him in my book, and there is no necessity of remembering him unless by two modes.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	 Of which one is to know the knowledge of a physician when he inquires about it, and so that its cure can be known for whom it happened?
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	 And the other mode is that we have many times used castration to various animals because of our needs for this purpose as with rams, goats, and cats, and similar ones from animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	 Therefore I say that castration fits according to two modes.
Aut per attritionem.	 Or through weariness.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	 And also through tear and cut.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	 In the case where castration is done through weariness, which method of operation we have practiced for sedating an animal in a warm water until its testicles soften and relax, and then tie them up so they will not fall off unless held by your hand: after that take them with your own hand until they become loose and do not appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	 In the case of castration through tear and cut, it is necessary to hold an animal tightly with your left hand while you gently remove his testicles using your right hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	 Then tie up the suspensors securely and dry off all over his body by removing one of the cuts completely until they both come to pass: then make an incision where you have removed them, so that nothing is left beyond the delicate cut which extends along the back except on top of it something very thin.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	 This is a medical technique for castration which is better than by pulling out the testicles. The reason being that pulling of the testicles may result in loss of semen, therefore one wants to castrate an animal
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Afterwards take care of the wound until it heals
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	 Regarding the different modes (methods) for castration in women
Caput LXX.	 The 70th mode
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	 Hermaphrodites are castrated by two methods:
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	 Hermaphrodites are castrated by two methods: either through the space between their genitals or by cutting off their testicles; which is done inside of them both, with a figure resembling that of a woman, and with hairs sometimes running from it where they have cut off one or both testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	 In women it is one kind of figure, and that of a woman over the labia in exactly the same way as the testicles of men are parted from each other by one, and two by two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	 And regarding the three kinds of castration, two from men and one from women is necessary to do this so that the added flesh may be removed until the impression of their testicles has passed.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	 Afterwards take care of the remaining wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	 Regarding the second method for men from which urine comes forth, as that of cutting off their testicles, it is not an operation nor a care to them at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	 Of the incision of the clitoris and the prominent parts (the clitoris) in women.
Caput LXXI.	 The 71st mode
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	 Excessively (excessively) added to the natural part until it is torn and becomes ugly; and sometimes it is so great as to be a target of some women that it extends like this for men too and has reached its peak.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore it is necessary to hold off the excess of the clitoris with one's hand or a knife and cut it so that no flow of blood occurs.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Afterwards take care of them until they heal.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	 "And that which is born from the uterine opening remains within it until it's discharged; and oftener may be drawn out through its own likeness to a tail, or more precisely by incision in accordance with the shape of the buttock: and for this reason some people call it Aegritude caudata.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	 Therefore let us cut her as we would a knot (or ligature), and cure her until she is cured
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	 The cure for Alratica is given to women who have not been perforated by the uterus.
Caput LXXII.	 This is a number.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	 Alratica (or "roughness") refers to the state of having an unperforated uterus in women or the presence of a fistula.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 It can be either natural or accidental
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	 The accident is from the cause of Aegritude Caudae (or rough tail) and either she was born with flesh added to it or with a subtle cut/wound or a spit/spit-cut: and she may also fit into the womb, into her side, into its top or bottom, into a deeper uterus, and prohibit pregnancy, childbirth, and menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	 The knowledge of this comes from the appearance (or proximity) of obstetrics if there is an apparent relation (or close relationship).
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	 If not then seek her with your fingers or a tool
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	 If the proximity is from the cause of Aegritude Caudae and she has a close relationship with both sides then go ahead (or proceed) and remove her immediately (or strike off).
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	 And it is that you lay on two vulva lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	 Then place both of your fingers together and the woman lies stretched out with her own arms above her back.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	 Then spread apart two vulva lips until the subtle cause of Aegritude Caudae is removed and there appears knowledge (or appearance).
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	 Then take the woman to bed with you and drink her as a bath (or anointing) in oil and lay her over the place; and for every day she should be present until no other place is left dry.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	 If a vein is swollen and tender, then it should be cut with a sharp knife along its course
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	 If a swelling from the flesh is spontaneous, then suspend it with hooks and cut off its head: and apply medicine to stop the flow of blood without injury or harm to the flesh, such as with acacia bark and dragon's blood, so that it may coagulate with elder flowers
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 After administering a large spoonful of wine to prevent the swelling and hold it tightly in place for several days, then administer licorice root powder, which will cure any remaining inflammation through continued care until healing is complete.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	 And when one is born into a cancerous matrix, then it should be cut off according to this manner so that the contrary of cutting with iron may not occur.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	 Cure for hemorrhoids and bothor ointment on women's vulvas.
Caput LXXIII.	 Chapter Seventy Three
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	 Hemorrhoids are the opening of veins in the anus and rectum, causing much blood to flow through them.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	 When hemorrhoids are alleviated, they disappear and I shall describe their nature, signs, and what to do about them later.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	 Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids occurring in the matrix opening are not treated with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	 Those appearing from the matrix opening which fall onto what is below them should be treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	 Therefore it is necessary for a woman to enter into her cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	 Then stretch athehelil with hooks or cloth and cut them off from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	 After cutting off the veins and hemorrhoids from their roots without injury or harm to them, apply a poultice with one incision of cuts mixed with acacia bark and dragon's blood so that it may coagulate and stick fast to its own blood.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	 Then he will stand on the wall for a moment.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	 Place her gently in cold water
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	 If blood flow was interrupted: then place her in a warm bath (decoction), and put on hot towels, and heated combs, and the like
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	 Afterwards take a hot iron rod (farnam hordei), and with a sponge and vinegar, bind her up tightly on his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	 If blood flow is interrupted with him (the person), it's good to do so gently and without any cuts or scars.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	 Afterwards take a sponge and pour over it (the person) the juice of bitter wine or the like, until they are bound down gently but tightly, so that their limbs may not move around.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 After this happens, take care of his body with oil and water, until he is cured (healed).
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	 In the meantime, if you are using red wine, keep it similar to the hands for some time
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 So let him drink until he is cured (healed).
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	 From the perforations of the matrix that was injured.
Caput LXXIIII.	 The head has 72 parts.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	 Many perforations of the matrix occurred, like cancer and cold sores, ulcers, abscesses, boils, and boils (aleki) in the matrix, etc.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	 I also mentioned all the wounds and signs of them (the perforations), their dressings separately: it is necessary to say here how opening her with iron happens when they join together to bind him, so that you may know how he opens up with a knife.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 So let you consider
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	 Then if the pain from sores is acute with his falling and there's a fire or fever, you apply a cold compress to him (the person). If it falls on top of him, then do not open her until she has healed completely, and take care of her as before so that when her pains subside.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	 "You should seat the woman on a bench so that she rests her buttocks upon two seats and reclines; if you lower them to her belly, then they should be supported by their feet at the lowest part of her body. Stretch out her thighs, place your arms under hers, and tie each arm with its own cord.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	 "Then the attendant woman should seat herself on the right side, and administer the instrument by which the opening of her mother will be opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	 "Whose form entered into these after that one is complete.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	 "And when you administer this instrument, let her make a deep breath as the woman after giving birth; lest what is drawn out from it be deeper than necessary for the mother, and soothe the exhausted one.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	 "If the instrument is deeper than necessary for giving birth, then you should put a pad over the deep part of her mother's abdomen; lest the entire opening be drawn into it and cause injury to the mother; so that one may tie off the cord from above the highest side; and until the deepest part of her body is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	 "And when the forceps are visible and touched by hand, they should be gently pulled out of her belly near to her head with a soft pull.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	 "And when the baby is extracted and you have pulled them out of her belly near to her head with a soft pull; then put on the subumbrella of dark olive oil or the umbrella of white wine, which has some stickiness; tie it on, and take off the section in the deepest part of her body.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	 "And put an exterior over the mother's chest and under the nose a veil made from soft wool soaked in water which contains lead.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	 "Then she would be treated after two days with oil that suited it; until then.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	 "And when the water and membranes are washed away so that they are treated with water mixed with dill or long pepper; then after being rinsed off with water which contains the root of lily or hyacinth.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	 "If a vein has separated from its membrane, then you must remove it by cautery [burning with a heated instrument] using the method we discussed for division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	 "Doctrine of childbirth, as practiced in delivery: not by a natural exit of the body.
Caput Lxxu.	 "Head 60 [LXXU]".
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	 It is necessary for an obstetrician to first determine the natural form of delivery.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	 "Therefore, you should know that when a woman is held down by her lower hand and wants to breathe air above, the thing which is over [her] must be released from her, it being the exit of the child; then you will understand that this birth is according to the natural form. And in death it departs with its head above.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	 "Therefore, when you see these signs [of childbirth], then it is necessary that his belly be pressed down so the child may drop out more quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	 "And when he departs from his head above, then it is necessary that the child be released in good form by means of those things which are abundant.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	 "Whoever is outside this birth is unnatural and admirable.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	 "Since sometimes the child passes over his feet and before [the head of] him, and drops his hands before his head; or if one hand is missing from him or heavy as a stone: in any case it turns back upon its own neck, and similarly by signs admirable.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	 "Therefore it is necessary for an obstetrician to be prudent and cautious about these things all around him, avoiding error and deception; I am pointing out everything from them according to their nature, how the child is born through this thing and what its origin is.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	 "When the child is born by its natural exit from above and in this manner over a woman [who struggles] with great difficulty to bring it forth; then let them hold her down on their hands or feet: but if they are unable to do so because of fatigue, let them prepare it for cooking and frying with the juices of onions.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	 "Having placed the midwife between her fingers and thumb to grasp it gently, she finds with its aid another finger, seizes that one with hers own, until she has reached what is within her by moisture; then she loosens the woman's hand when the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	 "If it did not descend, then let her be lubricated with a mixture of oil and unguent to facilitate its descent.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	 "Having lubricated her after the speculum, let him approach and hold onto her head as tightly as he can; he will then be able to see its mouth.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	 "The fetus will immediately descend.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	 "If the hands of the woman come together and enclose the fetus first, then let her be gently lowered as soon as possible.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	 "If the woman cannot enter into childbirth first time, then let her stand over the bed and put her feet together; next she must stretch out the legs to touch the ground as much as possible; finally, hold onto her so that she does not fall because of the movement.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	 "If the hands do not descend and the fetus dies; then drive them away from each other with haste and remove what remains of the fetus; tie down her hand with a cloth until it is removed as well.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	 "The descent of the fetus comes to an end on its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	 "When it has descended onto the feet, then let her rush towards them; next she must gently pull and straighten the fetus.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	 "Then she takes one of its legs and stretches it out gently.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	 "When the hands reach up to her hips, then lubricate and let him approach and hold onto her as tightly as he can; it will descend immediately if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	 "And if the descent is not accomplished as desired, then gently lower it down until you have placed it in its usual position.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	 "At that moment, let him quickly go out and descend easily.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	 "If we wish to prevent the same from happening completely, then take everything that is about to enter and hold it back with a cushion made of high-quality cork or sponge soaked in honey and gum solution. Then strike all parts of the body firmly on the stone (mortarium) until death ensues. Afterward, wash her/him with water.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	 "Afterwards, seat them in warm water and wait for the pain to subside.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	 "When you have heated him/her sufficiently so that the lower part is relaxed (hypocundria), then anoint them with myrrh and apply a compress.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 "Once the myrrh has been applied, seat her on top of a bed or couch to relax further.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	 "Afterwards, gently stroke their face and nose with your hand (suflagio), and press the lower part of her mouth with a compress to facilitate breathing.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	 "Thus will it be quickly done.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	 "The fetus has exited through the legs and hands (genus).
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	 "When it exits according to this shape, gently introduce them with your hand slowly.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	 "Afterwards the woman is placed on her back and her feet are bent downwards towards the lower part (infundibulum), while she holds onto a support with both hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	 "Then press gently upwards into his mouth slowly.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	 "Afterwards remove what is beneath her feet from the navel downwards until it is pressed up to the lower part (infundibulum).
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	 "If the fetus does not exit through the legs, then take her feet and move them back as mentioned earlier.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	 "Afterwards press upwards towards her face gradually until the fetus reaches the upper part (superior).
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	 "Then introduce your hand gently and equalize the fetus slowly until you press down on her to stop it from exiting.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	 "The fetus exits with its head downwards, hanging off of both hands (latitudinaliter).
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	 "Introduce it gently while reducing the hand.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	 If you cannot reduce it, then take a woman and make her walk
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	 If she cannot walk, then lay her on the table; support both her legs with a cushion to prevent crushing injuries.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	 After that, apply a soothing ointment made from mallows.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 If she gives birth while lying on it, then lay her gently onto the bed.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	 After supporting with both hands and aligning the fetus as naturally as possible, gently lift up the woman; hold her until she is comfortable enough to move on her own.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	 The fetus falls from its mother's body and the face of the infant is towards the back of the mother's belly.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	 The obstetrician holds onto the fetus with both hands and gently rolls it back quickly and easily.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	 Once she is comfortable enough to move on her own, lay her gently onto the table; support both her legs with a cushion to prevent crushing injuries and apply an ointment made from olive oil and mallows.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	 Then gently lift up the woman so that she can move about slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	 After doing this, lay her gently onto the bed; support both her legs with a cushion to prevent crushing injuries and guide her towards one side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	 Then gently lift up the woman so that she can move around slowly.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	 The fetus is gently lifted off of one side, away from any support provided by both hands and legs.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	 When the fetus has descended through a natural opening in the mother's abdomen and is guided by her finger to help it move downward towards its head while keeping an eye on how much fluid should be present as indicated before.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	 If the fetus is suspended by its face and body then cut it away from the umbilical cord; so that it does not stay there and die (due to lack of air).
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	 After cutting away the umbilical cord then pull the fetus towards the inside; support the woman so that she can move around a little and soon enough it will be born.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	 Death of twins, or death of many
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	 And when twins are born to more than one pair and sometimes four pairs
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	 However this is rare
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	 But five of them are not in accordance with nature and do not feel pain but remain bound together by a cord connecting to their navel.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	 And sometimes they are separated at birth like the other one is born through a natural death and easily, while others die in such a way that it would be difficult to describe them separately
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	 And if it is difficult for some of them at birth and they are carried by what we described as unnatural figures then the cure for them should be such that you do everything possible to help them in a way as natural as possible, gradually and gently, making sure to follow every step as closely as you can to the one prepared with great care to bring about their healing
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	 The remembrance of this which is formed in the womb from the embryos and they are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	 When one is formed in the womb and two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, ten, fifteen, and more are formed then I have seen it done that a woman aborted them all, and others were made.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	 This is the measurement of the glorious wise men.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	 Therefore, this should be all in obstetrics knowledge.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	 However, if you wish to do the same for her [i.e., the woman]
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	 Of the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	 Chapter seventy six
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	 When you are dealing with a dead fetus as I described it earlier through the use of medicine and not being born, but you carry out your work using operations with hands, then at this point it is important to remember.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	 If then the woman is of healthy virtue and not with someone through accidents which it is feared that she might lose over her, then at this point it should be made such that a woman sits upon her back, on her chest, so that her head is brought to one below, her legs raised: and care for her must be taken from both sides or tied to the bed so that the body of hers will not be removed through extraction of fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	 And from veins containing male seed with honey and tallow, and foenugreece, and semen.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	 And the Obstetrical Surgeon takes hold of his hand with these oils and honey, after which he inserts her into the mother's womb gently.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	 And while she is in that place where she lies in wait for the newborn child, and finds ease to it nearby.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	 Therefore consider that if the foetus is ready to descend on its head: then look upon it from his eyes or face or mouth or palate or chin or under his beard or fork of hair or beneath the lower edge of his jaw or in front of the fold of his armpit, so that you may see how well he fits into the mother's womb.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	 But if it has descended from its feet to its chest: then consider also between his ribs and under her breasts.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	 And it is necessary to hold him with the right hand and place him into that which is between the left hand's fingers: and insert him gently while holding his hand with ease, looking for a space among those places we have described so as to complete his descent.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	 And while looking for him against the left side of another place or third if possible: so that his descent is neither too tight nor loose but in balance and with ease.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	 After which he extends with equal force and not by right alone but as much as possible so that the exit from him is made easy; just like when you remove a tooth at his removal, it should happen in this manner too.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	 And there must be within that which lies between those so that the extension may be softened and not too strong.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	 If part of him is retained from being pulled out: then the Obstetrical Surgeon must take hold with some fingers and olive oil, and insert them by way of that space so as to be able to release his descent while holding on to what is held tight.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	 If part of the foetus slips away: then shift them to a higher place and do this until the whole fetus is released.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	 Therefore, I raise my hand over other things and cannot reduce it; this is due to the fact that his arm has become stiff from lack of use; so he must stretch the hand across himself by lifting up a piece of cloth or something similar.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	 Next, when I have completely raised the hand, either cut through or at a joint of the palm (that is, at the interphalangeal joint), or make a slit; and then you should take hold with the other hand as well, using both hands for this purpose.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 If the fetus is large or injury to his arm occurs at birth or there was accumulation of water on his head; then he should insert a sharp, pointed object between his fingers and find its way out with his head, and also raise up the water by using something called Almisdac, which shape fits in with the shapes of the remaining instruments in the chapter that is after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	 Similarly if the head of the fetus is large in nature, then you should pull it out using a rope or something similar; or raise it up by grasping it with the other hand as we have described.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	 Next, you take hold of his bones and fingers.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	 If the head is removed and there was a restriction at the neck; then you should find it until the humidity that is in his chest has been released.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	 If this does not fit or cannot be brought to an exit; then cut off the head with a swift blow as you are able.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	 If the lower part of his belly is separated from below or there was water accumulation in him; then you should execute this immediately until he has passed all the humidity out of himself.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	 If his fetus is above his feet; then grasping him should be easy and leading towards the mouth with the breast or arms of one hand to guide this will make it easier for you.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	 If there is restriction at the back or chest; then you should pull him out with a cloth that was placed on your hand as we have described and find his lower part until all of it has passed.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	 If any of the remaining parts are severed and the head is restored, then the left hand obstetrician should perform the procedure
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	 If the mouth is opened up to that extent and the head is restored, then the left hand obstetrician should put it into its socket deeply within her womb; she will tie it on with those parts of the head which are tied back there; [she] will sew him up to his fingers reaching all the way back until he reaches the mouth of the womb. Afterwards, the left hand obstetrician should introduce one or two hooks inside of that, and tie them together.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	 If the mouth of the womb is constricted by adhesions caused from a cold object that had injured her, then it is not necessary to try and extract him out through the mouth; instead she should administer an emulsion of fluids warm, dry, and liquid [?], and place the ligature: and let him sit in those liquids which will soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	 If the fetus is above its own level, then it is possible that he may be equalized; she should administer what we have already said to him by way of a drink.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	 If this cannot be done, then the operation will fail and she must extract it out.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	 And let her not remove anything from inside of his second part at all times.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	 Once you have finished your procedure, she should administer what we have already said to the obstetrician's hooks which cause damage within the womb;
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	 If an injury occurs to a blood vessel, then it must go down into those vessels, and she should administer what is left for curing.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	 And I have just heard of a woman whose womb the fetus died within; afterward she was impregnated by way of another penis, and then the other fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	 Therefore an injury occurred to him after a long time by way of his umbilical cord, and it was swollen; eventually the opening became open, and he began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	 I am called now towards curing of his, and I have been treating him for a long time; but the wound is not consolidated.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	 Therefore, I put upon him with certain strong ligatures of flesh: and he came out from his place through the mouth.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	 Indeed they passed him some days and another mouth exited out of him.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	 I am therefore here now that the mouth is not within me.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	 I thought because there was a fetus of a dead body from outside my belly.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	 I therefore removed the wounds and took out many bones of a woman who was present with better dispositions; and he died as long as it lasted.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	 And I did not hold fast here this externality although there was knowledge of it and aid to do that which the physician administers with his own hand from the care.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	 Of instruments necessary for extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	 Chapter 70 of On Regimen of the Physician.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	 Here is the form of Strictorius which are equal to books; there are two wounds equally on both sides of two trees.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	 However, this Strictorius should be more subtle than in the vein; or it may be made by the flesh or the wood of the vessel.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	 And the width of all wood is like two fingers; and its margin to either side is almost as one finger; and length to either side is palm-width, breadth, and half its breadth: in the middle of two trees there are two additions made from that same wood which have already been established on both sides, whose length is palm-width plus a little more: and width for each is like two fingers or less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	 And these two additions are inserted into the mouths of the veins that you may open with them when you should desire to draw out both wounds.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	 The form of the vein which is opened up
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	 Another form similar to that one; more subtle and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	 It should be made from the flesh or wood, according to the likeness of the veins.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	 However, these two additions from them are like palms-width; and width for each is like two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	 "When you wish to open a vagina with it, then close it on the tongue of a woman, placing her feet around its base, and leave as an opening between its lips.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	 "Then introduce both of these tools together into the vagina, and you hold fast to the lower end with your other hand between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	 "Then introduce your hand with the tool as you do when inserting fingers, but in equal measure to the extent that your opening of the vagina has already done.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	 "The other form is more difficult than what was previously mentioned about stimulating, which refers to the pushing out of the fetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	 "The third form is when you put a large head on it and press with your fingers like you would to open the mouth.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	 "And when something is inserted in a manner similar to this shape and its fingers, like you would with the mouth, but using teeth like the teeth of a sawblade.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	 "The fourth form refers to putting a small head on it.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	 "Those who hold one spine have the ability to turn themselves inside out.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	 "Those who hold two spines can bend themselves into a curve like a bow.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	 "The fifth form is when you put teeth on the fingers and insert it as if inserting the head of the fetus, but with teeth similar to those of a sawblade.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	 "Those who have two small arms can bend themselves towards each other at the neck to remove their heads.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	 "And those with two short legs, they are also called Lators.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	 "All of these instruments are used and the number of their forms multiplied, and are prepared for use in a skilled artisan, either as part of an operation or for other purposes.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	 "Therefore do not take away any of these tools from me unless it has been prepared by you beforehand.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	 "The need for them is obvious.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	 "Of the removal of the second [tool].
Caput LXXVIII.	 The last head.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	 When the placenta is separated from the birth, then it is necessary that you remove the umbilical cord quickly and gently to keep hold of its desire/life force.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	 After this, cut her loose from the birth canal with a sharp tool; grasp your hand and put it in his mouth, and tie off his nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	 Therefore, if the cord is severed at that point, it is good/beneficial.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	 If not, take the cord and pierce through it in a hole; place within its mouth herbs like chamomile, sweet marjoram, rue, and basil; tie this around his body, as tightly as possible, with fire beneath, to keep him warm and from dying until you can provide proper care.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	 After placing the cord through his mouth and around his body as tightly as possible with fire beneath to keep him warm until you can provide proper care, hold her/the other extremity in the mouth of the birth canal; keep it there until the water reaches the uterus.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	 After holding her in place as described before, cut off the cord when you are ready to do so.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	 The placenta will be separated with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	 If the placenta remains after this care and is not separated, then give a sharp tool to an obstetrician so that his hand may be dipped into sesame oil or tallow.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	 After holding her in place as described before, insert the umbilical cord into your mouth and suck on it until you are ready to cut off the cord.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	 When he has sucked her/the placenta loose from its place, then take hold of it and stretch it out as much as possible.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	 If the placenta becomes entangled deep within the birth canal, then insert your hand as described before until he has sucked it loose from its place and stretches it out fully towards the right side/left side; after that, increase the pressure to stretch it further so that it does not get trapped in the uterus's outlet; this is necessary for complete separation of the placenta.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	 This cord should be separated at that point and delivered to/from another person.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	 "If the womb is closed up, we cut it open like this: we heal her with a sternutation and from ointments with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	 "If the womb does not rupture when all is cut off, then it should be extracted gently, making sure you don't hurt her on your way.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	 "It is necessary that the womb being opened up to the mother should also be cut off from the woman.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	 Then apply a tetrapharmacopoeia ointment to her.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	 "Otherwise, she will rot and dissolve within days, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	 However, if the womb becomes rotten with a bad smell to the head and neck, it will lead her to death.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	 Therefore, appropriate suffugations must be applied to this
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	 Some of the ancients have already become skilled in the art of making such concoctions as will make things soft and moist.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	 A device used for suffugation at menstruation and the second part of the menstrual cycle
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	 Let the flame be brought near to a lamp or an oven; and let there be placed on one's breast an open hand over fire; the suffugation is thus positioned above the coals of a fire.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	 "About Ani no incision made.
Caput LXXIX.	 The 79th head.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	 Many boys are born; and of those none has had an incision made by Sifac the subtle one.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	 Therefore it is necessary that the midwife should make an incision with Sifac's finger; if she cannot, then with a sharp Spatumilus and gently apply pressure to prevent harm.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	 Then place on top of it infused oil and wine.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	 Then heal him with remedies until he becomes well.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	 "If the thing causing it is not removed by tomorrow morning after eating the lead, then put in a sieve one can of lead for many days, until he grows up enough to eat.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	 "And another fall has occurred due to the weakening of the bones, or from the loosening of joints.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	 Therefore, let it be done in order to reinforce that part, and then treat it after we have provided for its care and plastering as before.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	 Of fistulas occurring at the lower parts
Caput LXXX.	 The eighty-eighth chapter.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	 Fistulas occurring at the lower parts are fistulae, and fistulas caused by thickening near the anus may lead to a single fistula or multiple fistulas.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	 Therefore, as age occurs with the fistulae, they open and treat them by removing their white pus, or by removing the subtle pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	 And sometimes fistulas can be penetrating.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	 Therefore, when they are recognized as penetrating fistulas by the thing that has come out from them, and by vomiting, sometimes it is done with vomiting to relieve it; or possibly they are relieved by using medicines.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	 And fistulas are at the lower parts when there is space for penetration up to the anus and up to the bladder of meat, or to the urethra.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	 And fistulas are at the lower parts when there is space for penetration all the way down to the pubic bone and to its tail end.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	 The thing that recognizes the penetrating fistulas up to the anus and not penetration is when you point your finger into the anus; and you attempt with a subtle probe of the fistula by air or iron when there is no tortuousness.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	 If there is tortuousness in it, then you attempt to enter that by means of a subtle plaster or a hair from horsehair until you feel it, or by means of your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	 If you do not feel the fistula or there is nothing that comes out from vomiting or no pus or no medicines as I have said; then it knows that it is not penetrating and so it should be treated accordingly.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	 When the fistulas are penetrating all the way up to the bladder or meat of urine; then its meaning is by the exit from them and the prohibition against it in order that they be reinforced with medicines at this place.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	 If the probe is inserted up to the pubic arch or the os of the coccyx, then its mark should be that which penetrates until it reaches there; if not within tortuosities down to the os, discovery of pain on this side and on the other part, and always in the parts around him. And when it does not penetrate into them (the affected areas), neither is it treated with unguent or consolidated by any means.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	 In these fistulas all penetrating ones there is no treatment for everyone; and the treatment of them is a work and strength given to him from the physician's experts, through which he forms himself up.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	 In the one which is not penetrating and ancient hopes for health with a nail; as I told you before, and I already tested it; and there should be weakness between your hands on his back: put out his limbs up to above the buttocks of him, and place them bent towards the middle of him.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	 Then a hollow probe or an air one if it is in a fistula with tortuosities until you know where the attempt reached.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	 If however he felt that weakness around the finger, then you should put an index finger into his anus
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	 Therefore, if you felt that finger had already reached it by itself, except for what you felt between the finger and him, or meat; then certainly it is penetrating: therefore no labor in this case because its treatment was not given to him as we said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	 They then said that the treatment for some people was with flesh, and from a remedy of which it hopes improvement; is so that it makes cauterization subtle according to the breadth of fistulas as it had gone before, and put in the inflamed one into the fistula until he penetrates around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	 Then again this one or two, until you know because all these fleshly meats added filtered and like the tubes of the penis are already placed.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	 Then cure it with the use of ointments being inserted into butter until those fleshly meats are gone; then cure it with the help of the ointments which have been added, and are consolidated.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	 If it works well, it is good
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	 And if not, then without other treatment, never
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	 And if it fails to help you up to your finger which is inside the anus and between him and the thing that pushes out with a stick, then dry the cut skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you will wipe away as you try in the fistula until you succeed in pushing it out by force.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	 Then rinse off those filtered meats that are used for drinking, so they will not carry anything away from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	 If the blood gets on you and between your hand and your surgery so that you dry those meats: then do it better as much as possible and most quickly by burning them with fire or by a sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	 After the cautery with fire has added good habits and burning of the flesh and removal of blood and drying of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	 Then take care of that with the application of vinegar or with burning cloths until it releases pus and these meats are taken out dry from the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	 Then take care of that with the application of ointments, firmers and healers, until it becomes medicine where there is stiffness and drying.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	 Because when they are ready, then it immediately works well, and does not need repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	 If the fistula has already pushed out completely to the bottom of your anus and continues with excess body fluid: then insert your finger into it as deeply as you can and ask for help from him.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 If you feel that the attempt is between you and it, by force or flesh, then there is no operation for him except according to what trust and hope are.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	 This is because it operates in him one of three ways: or that cauterize it as we said before; or dry it until you get his consent to enter your fingers and do the treatment nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	 Do not cut off more than necessary in order that you do not injure the nerve endings of the finger and strike above the death of the hand, without causing pain.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then proceed with care as we have said so.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	 However, if it can be prevented: either stretch the finger or move your thumb to the side gently and back until you reach the tip of the finger, just as we have advised, or with another tool that has a sharp point, but not so much force that you cause pain.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	 Then cleanse the filtered meats which are in the incision until you have reached it with a good cleaning.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	 Then proceed to repair the nerves of all with the incision and above where it is tightened: And leave an open fistula on the inner part of the anus and there will be a lower one over the illness.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	 And when it suits the fistula in this way and is, if you try to enter into the fistula: and there is on the side of the anus about the surface of the body with a grip and the edge of the anus: then take a perforate extremity that is as sharp as an awl, namely, through holes of the heart, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	 And go around it with five strings, and along its way
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	 Then enter the thread into the fistula until it is fixed by her.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 If it happens that you penetrate from the inside side of the anus on up to the edge, then take out the thread through this hole, so that you put in your finger into the finger and remove the extremity of the thread and bind both together: and you hold one tightly with both hands until you die, or for two days. And if there are wounds among these two extremities and they fall off, then repair the nerves until it is fixed up.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	 If the fistula does not penetrate through a hole, then prepare for it to enter wherever you like except if it is deeply too much.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	 Do not do this for the finger so that you do not injure him.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	 "Therefore, as I have taught you before, if it is safe.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	 The Form of a fistula that causes great pain and the other part is not acute so it should not be inflicted because it's not necessary, just like you have learned.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	 Regarding the curing of hemorrhoids by excision and sealing of their veins; as for treatment.
Caput LXXXI.	 Chapter 71.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	 There are two types of hemorrhoids,
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	 And one kind is in the anus itself, like coal or lead; or if they are like small granulations
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	 And another is common and large ones too, from where always blood runs out, and it is one of them many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	 And there are others outside the anus; they can be found near its ends.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	 However, those that are outside the anus are usually small moist ones; from where the bitter water runs out or with little blood flow continuously.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	 The cure of those that are inside the anus is as follows; it will be applied so that the pain becomes severe until he defecates and shows them to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	 For this reason, or hold with your fingers; or tie them with your finger.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	 Then cut off those near their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	 If you cannot hold them with your fingers because of their moisture and softening; then bind them up with a cloth or tie them off with a knot from the ear lobe, and remove them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	 Then cut off those, and after removing some of their hot coals put a bandage on to cover the wound so it won't be exposed to cold.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	 Or use cautery as described above.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then cure them with the remaining treatment until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	 If the anus doesn't let go of its own accord when it is ready to come out, then apply a small ligature around that which is inside the anus so it can be used along with him as he is defecating and obeys his action when he has emptied himself.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	 If a tooth is external to the gum, then its removal is easy; and it is possible for you to remove it either with your finger or by using a nail file, and strike them off
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	 Then cure them as we said, until they are healed
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	 And if you use a nail file to remove it, then apply sutures according to this method.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	 Take the thread that has been tied and insert it into its place through the wound.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	 Then remove the tooth towards its top and make it penetrate with a needle through the base of his opposite side; tie both ends tightly, downwards one end and upwards another; and stretch the tooth with strong sutures.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	 After that take out the thread, and remove the wound.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	 Do this with all the teeth; and let one of them go free, so that it may draw out any superfluous blood from him.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	 Then place on the top of his head a poultice made of fresh oil or honey, and let it stay there; gently press down so that he may rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	 After that, remove it until he is dead.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 When the teeth have fallen out, then cure them with ointments and treatments; after that they will be healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	 About the treatment of fractures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	 Many times accidents occur from excessive heat or constriction by nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	 When this occurs, and it is not possible to treat them with medicine; then use the following methods until they become dry, after which you must remove any upper layer that prevents their consolidation.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	 After that, cure them as needed according to what is necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	 If they are not consolidated; then try them again with a greater reason than before until much blood is lost and you remove the treatment of those; after that, cure them until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	 About the treatment of bruises and not for wounds, and toothache.
Caput LXXXII.	 Eighty-two head
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	 It should be known that the swelling (nodus) is due to a rounded swelling resembling the color of the body and similar to the head's appearance; it covers the entire body except for the lower limbs, hands, and digits: and painful injury occurs in these areas when walking or using them.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	 Therefore, it is advisable to remove what is swollen around the eye and hold on tightly with both hands, or with a comb, and be removed from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	 Afterwards, take care of it by burning it according to what was mentioned previously in his chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	 But there is also a type of swelling that is prominent and sharp above the surface of the body, which resembles ash, soot, or soot.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	 And many injuries occur on the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	 The care for it is to burn or scrape off the swelling and let it fall with a comb; or hold it tightly while pulling out some of its hair, until it falls from exhaustion.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	 And if you want to remove it by burning or with a sharp remedy; and they will be burned away immediately, without resorting to the instrument which I mentioned earlier.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	 But there is also a type of swelling that is prominent and sharp above the surface of the body, which resembles ash or soot; it sinks into the depths as soon as it becomes cold, causing pain similar to biting formica (ant) bites, and affects the entire body: and many injuries occur on their hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	 The care for it is to pick up the quill of an aspen or a strong blackbird; and place the quill over the ant, until the quill keeps the circle closed off on its side.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	 Afterwards place your hand with the quill over it until you have removed what is around the ant's swelling; and put her into a deep hole of the body, and remove the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you want to remove it with an air quill or a wire in this shape.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	 With a superior grasp of instruments, it is brought down to the fingertips from above and applied over [or: held on] his finger, so that its own relief may be felt by touch and the relaxation thereof.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	 And if you are to cauterize with Formica, as it was explained in the chapter on cautery by Athelstan
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	 Of instruments used for treating wounds and their applications, fluids introduced into them to relieve pain, and ointments
Caput LXXXIII.	 Section eighty-three.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	 When the clister is used from an egg, or a heated iron, or by fire, or by mallet.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	 And when it is applied with these instruments, small and large, according to the one on which they are used.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	 Thus it is applied in the treatment of children with small fingers, light and sensitive.
Clistere magnum.	 The large one.
Cistere paruum.	 Small one.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	 Its upper end where the ligature is made is large and according to this shape it has a distinction so that it may be attached as firmly as with your fingers, and its lower part into which an opening is made on one side only is deaf or without sound, soft, gentle, yielding, sensitive in touch. And there are two foramina at the upper end of his shaft and one foramen at the lower end
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	 And the size of its foramina is according to the length and breadth of its root; broad but small ones and one in which medical remedies are put from animal's skin or paper, which is according to the shape of a sieve, whose root is like one finger
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	 The foramina are opened by multiple methods so that there remains an opening between every foramen and the breadth of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	 Then the filament is inserted strongly from raw thread through one of the foramina, or by means of that and the other surrounding it so closely as if interwoven.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	 And then put on his upper part a ligature from two firmly attached clamps.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	 "In order to heal with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	 This is a depiction of a circle in two halves here and a hole
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	 The quality of healing with it is as follows: either the cold medicine must be warmed up or heated, according to its quantity and tolerance; so that neither too hot nor too cold a remedy may be taken
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	 The sick person is placed on their back and the extremities are raised towards the head; and a cushion is placed underneath him to prevent his body from falling.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	 The extremities are wrapped with oil or vinegar or honey or similar substances.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	 This is inserted into the anus gently.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	 The minister receives both his hands simultaneously and extracts it with the same force, until all that is in the tube of the instrument has been extracted from the intestines.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	 After removing the tube, the sick person's extremities are placed towards the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	 If the medicine has the effect of drawing him out then it should be held as long as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if he falls asleep with it all night, sleep is more profound and intense.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	 If the sick person is placed into a solution of urine for cleansing purposes and it causes death then another tube should be inserted until he recovers.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	 If there are hemorrhoids or fistulae of the anus then a soft and mild tube should be used, gentle but not too soft to prevent any children from using it.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	 And this is a way that you can use when using a more rigid tube as well.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	 Of the cure of fractures without bone breaks
Caput LXXXIIII.	 Eighty-four
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	 I have spoken about the cure of wounds which was a part of my book and here is how it can be done with hand and with medicines according to complementarity
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	 I say therefore that wounds should be treated according to the place in which they occur and how deep it is
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	 "If there are many ulcers, they behave like a stone that is being cut or ground down by blows.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	 "Ultras that occur in the body's locations are like ulcers that fall on the head, or neck, chest, or belly; and similar things happen to those parts.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	 "And I am the one who arranges ulcers in a certain order so that they may be reasoned and regulated concerning the rest of them.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	 "And I begin by laying out simple ulcers on the head, because remembrance is arranged as part of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	 "Therefore, I speak.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	 "If the simple ulcer on the head was not broken by blows and it has become large enough that its blood is streaming forth warm; when this happens, look to whether he struck with a stone or some other object, or whether another object fell upon him from above: if so, remove the cut immediately. But do not pull out his own blood unless you have agreed beforehand in consultation about phlebotomy. If not allowed by law, only if there is barely enough blood from an ulcer to withdraw it.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	 "And let phlebotomy be performed upon the opposite side of the ulcer.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	 "And after he has been given water to drink and food that is substantial in quantity.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	 "But if eating something is prohibited by law at this point, then reduce it to food only and do not touch the flesh or urine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	 "If an object falls upon a large ulcer and warms it with warm oil or with wine that contains warmth.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	 "If you are secure from the warm object falling upon it, then place it there if its blood is present and not increased by inhaling air; later on I will tell you how to do it.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	 "If the ulcer is large or if it was cut out by a blow: and do not let its lips be sewn together with sutures; then sew them together yourself as I will tell you about sewing ulcers, according to what I am going to explain in the book on sewing of ulcers.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	 If a bone is already detected and hanging from it but there is no retention of it unless it is tied up with string (suspension). Then cut it off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	 After the bone is detached with medicine and it has been restored to its original place (bone) except for the skin, apply a plaster of cooked meat on that part which was cut off, so as to restore flesh in those parts where there is great swelling; just as heads and ears are eaten by chickens.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	 If the bone has become putrid and does not remain attached to its socket; then cut it off completely (bone) and treat it immediately. After that, apply medical treatment to it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	 If there is a vein (artery) within the bone or through which blood flows; and it does not come out by medicine; then cut into the artery itself.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	 If you do not remove it with a saw (bone); then cut off with scissors or tie it up.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If the necessity arises when you do not fulfill what we have said; then burn off with fire or tie it up until blood is released (bone).
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	 If the bone is simple and small; then cutting it off from (bone) will be easy too, just like a feather pulled upwards on that bone when fixed firmly before moving around.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	 Method of pulling out an arrow wound.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	 Prepare one olive part with two dragon parts of blood and three calcis which are not extincted; mix them all thoroughly and make a ball from it, then apply it to the bone so that it holds firmly against him until it adheres well by itself and is coagulated with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	 After applying the ball to the bone; then tie it onto a string and remove it unless you want it to remain tied to its socket; in such a way that it is not removed at all times.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	 If medicine does not remove it until it heals.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	 And sometimes doing it alone when there is no olive oil present and dragon blood; the same operation in many large bones, tying them up while it falls on top of that bone and they are tied with their own blood which did not change its state until now.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	 "If there is already a change in the vein at that time, especially when summer heat has come, then it should not be on this vein of which we speak: therefore, you should put something over her as a remedy to digest or place above her the plates prepared with flour and water until pus comes out.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 "Afterwards, treat the remaining wound by keeping it covered until healing is complete.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	 "If someone falls on a fractured bone and is unconscious, then remove that person with care and I say the remedy for fractures of the skull to come.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	 "Of the veins in the head.
Caput LXXXV.	 "The 85th joint on top (skull).
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	 "If someone falls on the veins of the head and is unconscious at that time there should be no difference between the vein itself and other wounds but only for a simple wound.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	 "If the vein of the head has already been cut off or an artery: then if it is a vein only treat him as before but not to use any remedy for its cessation until you have consulted and spoken with others who are knowledgeable in this matter.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	 "Since the veins are injured and they try to stop them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	 "Do not put anything cold on the vein at all because the substance of veins is cold and their continuation is with the brain which is superior to other organs, so use this remedy from a soft drink mixed with oil or sweet wine until pus comes out as well if it is also mixed with water: and for the remaining stones you should crush them in the same way that you crushed others but using damp unguents.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	 "If a large vein is injured then apply sutures or put it on with powders of its lips.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 "Afterwards treat him until he is healed completely.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	 "If a vein or artery is deep and has already accumulated pus at that location then pierce it with something more penetrating.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	 If a vein has been cut and its flow of blood is blocked, then it should be separated or dried off with heat (perhaps by fire) to seal the wound closed.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	 If the tongue has been pierced and saved from death (perhaps by cauterization), then it should be sewn shut with skin sutures over its mandibles, so that no gaps are left between them; tie off both sides of the mouth together, ensuring equal spacing to prevent the tongue from falling out.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	 Finally, after all this has been done and the patient is recovered for a certain period (perhaps days), it should be released as per its natural course of growth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	 Finally, after all this has been done and the patient is recovered for a certain period (perhaps days), it should be carefully washed with ointments that relieve tightness and itching so that it can heal properly.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	 If a bone has been broken and it is still intact within the wound, then you should remove it with all possible means if able to do so; otherwise, leave it as it was left before, until it becomes rotten and comes out of its own accord.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	 If the wound is recently made (perhaps within hours), then wipe off whatever you have previously applied to it with water or a suitable cleaning agent.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	 If there is an open fistula from the wound (perhaps by a mistake), then it should be cured according to its description given in its chapter or section of another book on medical treatment and healing.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	 These are instructions for dealing with wounds on the palms of the hands, but they can also apply to other parts of the body as well.
Caput LXXXVI.	 This is Chapter 86 of another book.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	 If there has been a thrust or stabbing injury to an organ (perhaps the heart), then you should carefully consider its depth and extent of penetration immediately.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	 If therefore the wound has caused a fatal illness from which he is now suffering, then you should know that it was a mortal wound and must treat him accordingly until death or recovery occurs.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	 If the depth of penetration was not significant and it is recently bleeding from its own blood (perhaps due to a small tear), then do not apply anything to it at first; tie off both sides together gently so that no blood can remain in the wound or penetrate further into the body, causing death. Do this for two days if necessary until either he recovers or dies.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	 "If your fingernail is not present to you at the time, then put it into the hole of your own finger immediately so that it may bring back what it has seen from its moisture; and let him lie still over the wound until he gathers together whatever is in him.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	 "If the fingernail is overdue for three days or more and does not cause a spasm of weakness nor trembling of the heart nor constriction of the throat nor any other harm to him in his movements; then you know that there is pus in it.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 "Therefore care for him and with ointments and all remedies until he recovers.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	 "If the health of his fingernail is given up to you forever and it never opens again; then you know that a fistula has been made.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	 "Therefore care for this one from its own hole.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	 "And if the fingernail is from an injury to the skin or a bite of the nail and it is simple on the chest; or on the back; then care for him with what precedes from sewing, that was great; or with wiping, that was small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	 "But if it has made an impression on the bone and went out through that; then seek for the fingernail and draw forth what is separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	 "If there are not separated ones, then dismiss them until the fingernail decays; for their expulsion has been commanded.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	 "The judgment of the accidents on the fingernails and the care thereof in other members is given by us.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	 "Of the finger-nails, and their coming out from the intestines, and their expulsion.
Caput LXXXVII.	 The eighty-seventh chapter
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	 "The disruption that causes entry is great; medium; and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	 "Therefore when it is seen by the great one at times in the intestines or count of the intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	 "Therefore let their entry be made; and that sewing with greater effort and more difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	 "The separation is both easy and difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	 Therefore, it is more difficult if you are unable to enter his location immediately through her entrance and she opens up and swells up; this makes the entering in quite difficult for him.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	 This is because of that reason; therefore, the middle way between disruptions has become easier, since if you cannot make her intestine difficult to enter as easily, it becomes equally difficult in two ways for him.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	 The sutures on his wounds are according to four methods.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	 The two common sutures join together to the sutures of the belly and the sutures of the dead bodies; and there are two others that communicate with the other wounds specifically.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	 However, these last ones are more of their own kind than to the belly; and I tell you one at a time with exposure and proclamation.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	 I tell you because when the bowel is opened and something comes out of it into the intestine, and it becomes difficult to reduce him; then that is for one of two ways.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	 Or because of the abundance of the disruptions as we have mentioned before; or perhaps due to the swelling from cold air that is inside it.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	 Therefore at this point you should heat him up; either by immersing the sponge into hot water or by wrapping a damp cloth around his body so that he can recover from the cold as quickly as possible.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	 Or if you immerse him into warm water; or with a hot iron, and place the sponge against his stomach while it is inflamed inside; until he can recover from the swelling.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	 Whenever you put this liquid, which has a stiffening effect on him, into water and immerse him; it is better than immersing him in water alone to resolve the swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	 Once you have resolved the swelling, then heat up his intestines with hot water or with a hot broth (possibly also called 'altea').
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	 This way it is easy to enter him through her entrance.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	 However if you are able to remove the sutures after this treatment, then there will be fewer disruptions with the instrument that is used for hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	 The first care is better when prepared than sectioning; and there's no cooperation for subsequent healing after necessity or the presence of an instrumentally defective part
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	 The part of his body that is hard and thin, like a wedge, the other not sharp but blunt (as if made from wood), and the tip of this delicate one should be with greater difficulty than sharpness itself
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	 Therefore the swelling and inflammation of the gut should be reduced according to its natural shape (form) at its own place by itself, if possible, because it is better for it
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	 If a wide disruption occurs at the lower part of the belly, then you should arrange to have it supported by its own back and raise its legs higher up toward itself.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	 And if there is a disruption at the upper part of the belly, then you should arrange to have its head placed and lift its chest higher than its lower part.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	 And similarly if there is a disruption in one of two parts of the belly, you should arrange your attention and care to be always like this so that the part with swelling will have its higher part towards the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	 And you should arrange it so that there are not too many swellings and not too few, but just enough for each swelling.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 But if the swellings in each part are equal to one another, then you should arrange it according to what has been prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	 Then make sure that the present-day person is in your hands so as to hold on to the whole disruption using only one hand; and gather up both its ears.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	 Then you should take away from it, what follows sutures to something else (i.e., remove the sutures); and this is how common a suture procedure is done with one hand.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	 And it is so that you should take away from each swelling as much as its size allows; this is how the sutures are applied to the swellings.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	 Then you should remove a certain amount of the disruption from both the thumb and index finger separately; that is, the doctor does this; then gather up one thread beyond what goes into it in two parts with cuts on each side below where there was an incision, until you make it penetrate to another part, and have gathered together two portions by this way; and so are four orders completed.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	 "Then, with two needles of different sizes tied together at their centers, you will gather the lips towards both sides simultaneously.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	 "Then, remove the excess length from each finger and insert another needle into them both at once: afterwards, bring it back together with thread as you did before.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	 "Therefore, do not continue doing this with the same needle as that which is inserted: until you have completely tightened all of the lips.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 "The medium needle is between the excess length and subtlety of it: because the subtle needles penetrate meat more easily than the coarse ones; they are difficult to insert into a wound for that reason.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	 "It is not advisable to have the needle close enough to both sides of the skin so that it penetrates meat easily; if this happens before consolidation and does not allow for proper closure, do not let the wound be closed.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	 "Then, cut off the excess of thread at both ends and tie a knot in it to hold the needle securely; remove them when you know that the wound is already closed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	 "This kind of suture with a needle as described above is more convenient for sewing on lips than using other needles.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	 "Since one or two needles are enough to sew the lips together, do it either with one needle through them both ways, or with two needles side by side.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 "The second kind of suture is common for sewing together four sides; two sides by one needle and the other two sides tied with it.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	 "Then, when you have penetrated with the needle all four sides and release it from the side to which it was first tied, so that the thread is tight at both ends of the lips: this is a common kind of closure like closing clothes.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	 "People are familiar with this type of closure.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	 With this suture I closed the wound that had been inflicted by a knife on its own inside; which was previously cut through with a tool and there had been disruption of the veins greater than one palm's breadth: and there was disruption in the middle of the belly, from both sides
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	 Therefore it remained outside his intestines for 24 hours
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	 Therefore the wound was treated and healed; after that it remained for fifteen days, and he recovered.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	 The doctors were saying that it would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	 It was only by a miracle that I didn't treat the wound with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	 Since I was not present at the place where it was forbidden to use ointments and nothing from medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	 Therefore I washed over him his own wound twice a day, and diligently gave him a bath with milk; until he was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	 Two of the specific sutures I mention in accordance to the narrative of the lecture.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	 And it is that you initiate with a sharp suture; and you go in from the outside towards the inside part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	 When the needle went into the cut, and towards its length and breadth it goes through all of the body; release the other end of the thread at the side where you introduced the needle, so that there may enter another from the inside to go out to the outside in one place, and from the outside to come in to the inside in another part.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	 When you did it penetrate, then do the same thing to penetrate according to this; release the other end of the thread at that place on the side, and make another enter from the inside going out to the outside in one part, and from the outside entering into the inside in another part.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	 Then begin also from that same place on the side with its extreme which is out of the needle's thread at one end; and take away this one that you have entered into the wound.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	 "Then remove the lower part of it and cut off its extremity that is on the side, making an incision there with this remaining extremity; then take out what is taken from one side of him and make it into a unit [i.e., form an artificial skin] along with others: and after doing so up to the previous incision, remove all external parts according to the example provided.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	 "The remaining parts of the surgery should be sewn to the skin that covers them as follows: i.e., join together with one suture what is removed from one side of him and the skin; until all are joined.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	 "The second type [of surgery] mentioned by Galenus.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	 "The speech of this one was as follows: i.e., so that the parts are joined together according to a similarity with some medical practitioners in such a way that they all come together according to their own kind by nature; and taking an extremity [of him], it takes another extremity, and joining them the opposite extremity is taken.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	 "And thus do you say what I have heard.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	 "It is permitted for you to make an incision in the opposite extremity that is near you from the outside part and let it penetrate into him alone; and remove two extremities of the skin.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	 "Then return to the previous step and make an incision from outside into inside on both extremities [of skin], that is each separately.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	 "Then return to the previous step and make an incision from inside into outside on both extremities [of skin], that is each separately.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 "The mode of this surgery is superior to the common one in ease and is superior also to the last type [of surgery].
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	 "This speech is that of Galenus.
Et dixerunt quidam.	 "And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	 "The stitches are put on the inside with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	 "This is so that you insert into them one filament [of skin] each; and begin with the incision of the needle from what is near you, and make it penetrate up to another side according to their stitches which are equal.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	 "Know that when there is a disruption within the heart's interior, then its repair is more difficult than the repairs of other parts.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	 The examination of wounds or medicine for wounds is the same as the examination of healthy wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	 Know that when you are using your blood to cleanse a wound before it becomes dry and then you remove the intestines of that animal, and clean its bowels with them, and make it ready for eating - in other words, when making use of it as food, first wash off its blood.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	 If the blood of a wound has already been removed but you are still using that animal as food before it is ready to eat then apply some unguents (ointments) which are in your possession on him who will make it ready for eating - in other words, if you use an animal after its blood has been removed and before it is ready for eating, then prepare a concoction or ointment.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Afterwards the care of that is just like the care of healthy wounds until it heals (is cured).
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	 But if you do not have any medicines at hand then immediately apply a concoction or ointment to it as soon as possible and let the pus flow out of it - that is, after applying a concoction or ointment to a wound without medicine (immediately), exchange it daily until it heals just like a doctor would treat you.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	 If there are simple remedies available for multiple wounds then use one of them instead of all the above.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	 If a wound spreads to the main part of the body into an injury then it is necessary that you immerse the area with warm olive oil or with spiced oil - that is, if the blood from a wound spreads throughout the limb and reaches the surrounding areas around the mouth and under the nails.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	 If there is pain or a blockage of the intestines then you must strip and anoint it with wine vinegar (or black vinegar) heated on fire until it is hot - that is, if there is putrefaction in the bowels already advanced to the extent of an exit wound penetrating even up to the groin.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	 Know that what is coming out of a large intestine is easier to heal than what comes from the small intestines - and know that it's harder to heal what comes from the small intestines.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	 The small intestine known as the jejunum does not gain health through wounds that strike it in every way: and this is because of its multitude from veins, and its size, and the nature of those who have created it; due to its subtlety and its proximity to the sources
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	 However if that which came from a wound is removed by you completely: then reduce it according to your reduction of the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Then if it has gone beyond the wound and is black or dark brown in color (indicating its death), you should tie a knot of silk above the place from which he was struck so that his blood does not flow out
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	 In the jejunum there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	 Then cut through the ligament above which is beyond that and hang two ends of the silk from the lower part of your wound over him so as to prevent his falling onto you, and taking him out by force at the moment he falls off, and issuing the blood of his wounds.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	 The remembrance that struck into the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	 When there is disruption into the intestine, and it was small: then it is possible that in some people to restore by means of those who were wounded within their own body with a blow from a lance; because he had a wound on the right side of his stomach, which was old, and there was an exit for the discharge, and bitterness.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	 I therefore care until he was not cured by me of his illness, nor did I refrain from carefully examining him thoroughly; but until he was cured and healed the place was maintained.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	 After I knew the place was already healed and strong, I feared a fall that would strike against him from his own side; but he did not incur harm from this source of injury.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	 And remained in better conditions with his eating and drinking, and being active; and he entered the bath, and trained himself in his diets.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	 "Some of those who practiced surgery said when a wound had occurred in the intestine and it was perforated: then it is necessary to tie it as shown here.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	 It is so that you should accept large heads of bees (beeswax).
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	 Next they gathered two lips and placed one bee wax head onto each of the wounds that had opened on top of the two lips.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	 And when it gets over them and he ties his mouth, from the head of him, remaining, so as not to be left behind.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	 Next they placed one more bee wax head on top of the other and did not cease to do this with the first bee in accordance with the quantity of wounds.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	 Next he reduced it and tied its wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	 That remaining heads attached to the intestine until the food is digested from the intestine, and it will heal and not come from an unfortunate disease of the intestines.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	 And it is possible that the intestine is tied even with a thread of fine silk; which was taken from an animal and attached as soon as it enters into the opening after.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	 And so you should take the extremity of this thread from the intestine and remove it much.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	 Next tie at its end with a fine silk thread.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	 And then introduce that thread into the intestine and attach it to him along with his intestines.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	 Next he reduced it in a disruption.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 And this method of surgery with bees and the intestine is not only according to faith but also wisdom.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	 So if it is large and extensive especially when found in a small intestine then there will be no other remedy than subtlety so as not to harm him completely.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	 About the treatment of wounds and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	 Eighty-eighth head.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	 It is known that all wounds whether old or new and have not been healed with a fistula are always open and do not stop emitting pus constantly, so they are called universally wherever the body may be a fistula and we call this one Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	 "A fistula indeed is a filtered knot, hard and white; without pain but with the touch of fingers causing pleasure. And because of this it has been named by some as 'Risati', meaning ribbon.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	 "It is moist on certain days when it emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	 "Perhaps the moisture can be cut off on certain days.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	 "Sometimes it is very moist and has little strength; sometimes it is thick and has a lot of strength; sometimes it is soft and thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	 "I have already spoken of division; when I said 'every sore that is not healed nor born on it flesh', this is due only to one reason.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	 "The reason is one of several possibilities - either due to a scarcity of blood within the body, or because of its evil nature; or possibly from the hardness of his flesh which prevents the growth of limbs; or perhaps it arises from foul odor and bad qualities of material discharged by it; or maybe it has no healing treatment at all. Or it could be because there is one eye in him and a great number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	 "I have already listed the signs and causes of these and their cures along with the treatments using medical division; now it is necessary for you to know about the treatment for fistula and zucker.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	 "Know that a fistula occurs in every part of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	 "Among these are fistulas that join with veins and arteries; or nerves, sine fibers; or intestines; or urinary bladder; or ears of the back; or those arising from the junction of tendons and muscles in the hands and feet - they cause a connection to the main body part.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	 "Therefore, from these fistulas is it necessary according to this manner - the treatment of difficult cases and not receiving one; and occupation with it was hard work and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	 "If the depth of any fistula does not extend to these points which I mentioned: take it with tongs or a hook made from iron if it bends according to its correct path and pull it out along with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	 "If the fistula is twisted, then grasp it gently using a fine hook or tool.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	 "Since its own length decreases due to weight loss on its body, and its shape changes because of the twist.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	 "If a fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to grasp it with your hand when trying to pull it out.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	 "Therefore remove the openings from its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	 "As a result of removing openings from the fistulas and their own openings, moisture penetrates it through other openings and moves out towards them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	 "Then inquire as to the method by which you can identify where it is an opening or not: whether it is a small hole and the fistula's concavity is long or close, or if there are many openings around it while it is covering everything completely; ask about its location using your question, use pain relief when pressing with your hand on that spot, and inquire about any other factors causing discomfort.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 "Since you are standing over it all, then proceed to its care with confidence and ensure that you understand at this point if a fistula is nearby and visible or just far away from insertion; or whether it is an artery, vein, one of the locations I mentioned, or somewhere else entirely; so secure the fistula according to what was previously described, and extract it based on filtration and corruption by its body, which originates in its opening because of the flesh, or through a tube, as well as all other factors: until you have been cured.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	 "If the depth of a fistula is extensive and according to its correct path, then it must be pulled out as deep as you are able.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	 Therefore remove the same from all its corrupted parts
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	 Then administer the remedy through a thin tube into the medicines and the wound itself; let it be inserted until it reaches the fistula's opening that you have comprehended with a probe made of iron, making sure to leave some of it until the acute medicine has completely corroded what remains in the fistula after its corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	 Then restore her with ointments that bring about healing; let it be restored until she is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	 If not, then burn the fistula according to what we have described earlier.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	 If the cause of fistula is known to you and it has been certified by you, then inquire about that and cut off its source according to what I described earlier; if this does not allow for anything from another vein or member, as we have described previously.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	 If a source is found by you and there is some corruption within it; then inquire about that and remove it until the corruption of it has been completely cleared off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with what he was born into, let him be cared for until he is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	 If not, and the discharge proceeds as it did before; then you know that you have not entirely removed the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	 Therefore inquire further above this second thing and bring to light its source; and remove him with utmost strength of your own.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	 Then restore him.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	 If it is healed then this is good; and if not, you know that the corruption has deep roots within his body which are not to be reached by any means.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	 Therefore there is no remedy for you unless you remove this natural course of hers.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	 If the source is corrupted and it can be brought to light by you with very fine probes which are inserted into that.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	 If there are many bones; then you will have to investigate the attraction of all of them so as not to remove anything from these with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	 "If a vein (artery) causes you harm from moisture, and there is no fear of its cutting or error at the incision site, then cut through those veins and flesh if they are present there, free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	 "However if there is no preparation of freeing the bones from your time (death), then take a knife and cut through what has decayed it into flesh - remove it, until that which is within their bones, flesh, and moisture decays.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	 "And protect the incision so that it does not become consolidated (fused).
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	 "The section you made during your surgery will be tightened.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	 "Take a knife and cut through it if you are able to do so; or apply some oil with Egyptian unguent (a mixture of olive oil and frankincense) beneath the flesh.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	 "When these are putrefying (decaying), and the bones are separated from them; their removal is made, and they are attracted towards each other.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	 "However if there is a large bone like the bones of the leg (crural), or hips (coxal), and similar ones; and what has been corrupted from it is a part great - then remove it by its last reason, until it has decayed in blackness and corruption.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	 "Then restore the incision.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	 "However if what is in it has been corrupted (decayed), and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bones - then you must bind (tie together) it; and cut through it to its whole extent until it reaches the place where corruption began: then attend to it, until it becomes consolidated.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	 "And I shall show you what happened with the knife of yours - so that you may apply it as an example and guide to your surgery.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	 "He was a youth of about thirty years old who experienced pain in his thigh; the cause that moved within him (the body), namely from the inside, until the material had gone up to the knee, and he was cured by being tied together with great strength: there was no external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	 Therefore, when there was a time of error for physicians, until they had opened their eyes and encountered many subjects.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	 After that, care was taken of him until his fistula had been closed, and many openings were made into him; for all these things emitted pus and moisture from the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	 Therefore many physicians attended to him for two years, and there was no wisdom in his hands as a physician until he spoke, then heard the sound of his voice, and saw the hole on his arm; and matters that were formerly flowing from them through large channels now stopped: all human bodies had been fed by him, and his body color became blue.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	 Therefore I inserted a tube into one of the openings on his arm, and it led to his mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	 Then all the openings were examined; and I inserted tubes into him from every limb of the body, except for his mouth.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	 Therefore I inserted one of them into him until I reached a part of the bones; and from there on he was corrupted: which had already become corroded, emaciated, rotten, and perforated, until it went right through to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	 I therefore cut off what I had found was corrupted from the bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	 And I removed that which had not been in the bone except for corruption, and cut it off.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	 And I had already removed him from there.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	 Then I placed restoration with the aid of bound medical substances in a long space.
Et non est consolidatum.	 And it was not restored.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	 Therefore I tried again and reached to the second opening above the first one; and inserted him with bones, continuing corruption until I cut off what had been found by me as corrupted from that.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	 Therefore I made an attempt at restoration for him.
Et non est restauratum.	 And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	 Therefore I reached to him again and did not stop putting my fingers into his mouth; but attempted restoration for him; but it was not restored until I cut through the bone near one finger, and removed him with his marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	 "After having treated him with remedies, I have made his wound to be healed; it was not necessary for this treatment to repeat itself in the course of his operation and sectioning, except on account of his infirmity's disposition or shortage of tolerance towards him due to fear. For he would fall at every moment through the carelessness and lack of foresight resulting from an excess of sudden calamities.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	 "For his body was whole and the flesh on it was firm; there had been made a proper arrangement of its parts, and he recovered his virtue; but he had become accustomed to his own disposition.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	 "If the upper jaw is already fractured and lies in that place within his body; then you must support him there according to this way of doing so, which involves taking hold of it with your hand and pulling upwards towards the head: and have someone else who is extending from above grasp the ligature and fix it on top. And another one should take care first to bind a coarse sinew upon that place.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	 "Then bind him securely to the flesh below his bone; and you extend your hand towards it so that you can draw meat from beneath, but do not let this piece slip through.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	 "Take a stick or a bandage below the bone and bind it securely there; because when you do that, it is not allowed to let any spoiled meat slip through.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	 "And it is necessary that the ligature above be bound securely to prevent any corruption of the bones and not show through his hand or arm; but you should grasp another ligature for yourself with your other hand.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	 "If his upper jaw is spoiled and not complete, the part of him must continue with another part; and corruption will be in the middle or a part of it, then take away all the meat from every side.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	 "Then place one below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	 "After that, cut away the meat from where there is corruption until the ligature extends to another part; and let the ligature be according to length in order to prevent the corruption.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	 If there is corruption of an incision (wound), then strike away that corrupted part and proceed to treat it separately from the other parts where it continues on one side only
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	 If there is corruption of both incisions (wounds), then do not treat that part separately; rather strike away the corrupted incision and proceed to treat only one of the two wounds.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	 If there is corruption (wound) on the hand or foot, then it's difficult to treat that part; proceed with treatment elsewhere if possible.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	 It is desirable for you to inquire into how the corruption appears so that we can properly understand and address your concern.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	 If you strike away that part and it is possible for you in whichever way suits your need to proceed, even with whatever cure or treatment is available at the time; when this does not bring about the desired result (healing), then turn elsewhere as well.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	 And you should know that there are many bones (elements) in the incision (wound), depending on their arrangement and preparation of them, with respect to the length and thickness, subtlety and power, and variety, and endurance, rarity, hardness, and other properties.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	 And it is desirable for you to bring together every tool necessary for the performance of that procedure or operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	 You should also know that these operations will be apparent on the appearance of the instruments used in performing them, depending on how intently you study them carefully.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	 And the knowledge of how to perform this art will serve as evidence for your own courage; then you can treat that part with everything from those instruments, which have been used to heal all diseases previously mentioned.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	 And I am concluding the list of instruments needed for this chapter; which ones you will use as examples when treating what you cut through and practicing on others is up to you.
Forma Serrae.	 Form incision (wound).
Forma alterius Serrae.	 Shape the other incision (wound)
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Shape the second incision (wound).
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Shape the third incision (wound).
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	 That shape for cutting (incision) is well-made and suitable.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	 "Let his right arm be set free of iron and strength; let him cut off his left hand by the sword.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	 The form or shape of joining the hands.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	 "Place his head in a steady position and make his two arms into stars.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	 "And let them not be joined together unless they are forced to do so when one of the heads falls off and it is great.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	 The form or shape of the greater arm.
Forma medii Rasorii.	 "The middle form, which resembles a shield.
Forma Rasorii lati.	 The form of the left arm.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	 The form or shape where the elbow is located.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	 "The underarm form.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	 The form of the right arm, ending with a curved extremity.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	 "The forearm form, which is thin and extended.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	 "The shape or form where the bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	 The greater arm form.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	 "This resembles the forearm shape and has an end like a chisel.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	 The form where the bone was cut out of the arm.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	 His extremity is triangular and sharp.
Fit ex Indi.	 "The shape or fit that fits on an Indian.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	 And similarly for all the other shapes mentioned earlier related to arms and fingers.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	 "Of cutting the extremities and crushing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	 The eighty-ninth head or section of the work on surgery by Albucasis
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	 "The extremities become putrid either due to an external cause or internal causes.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	 "When the disease has taken hold of them and they are diseased due to the skill of the physician or their own negligence; then it is necessary that you cut off that member as far as corruption proceeds until infirmity occurs from there.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	 That which was struck by it is degraded (or dishonored) the member until it becomes heated; either burned or decayed after sunset: until it occurs as a result of that member and it seeps into the whole body
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	 Therefore with the strike of its own, and similarly if it causes injury to the striking one as well (i.e., for example, by a blow from a scorpion in the sea or a blow from an arrow): like that of a scorpion's sting, or poison dart, or something similar.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	 If the injury is caused by a blow to the very end of one's fingers (i.e., an injury from a sword or other sharp object), then strike that finger immediately and do not allow the spread of the corruption until it reaches all the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	 And similarly if it happens to the hand, then immediately strike it off with a forceps or some other implement of that sort and do not allow the spread of corruption until it reaches both arms.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	 If it occurs to him, then immediately strike his arm at its junction with the body.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	 If that corruption goes on and affects him around the side of the body (i.e., if it is an injury to one side but not both), then death occurs as a result of his weakness.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	 To administer something beyond that by caring for him involves virtue in its quantity.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	 And similarly when the corruption occurs to one finger, then immediately strike it off at a single joint (i.e., if an injury is caused by a sharp object): and if it affects both feet or legs, then immediately strike all of them.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	 If corruption goes up to the knee (i.e., affecting the leg), then immediately strike its junction with the hip.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	 If corruption has already gone above the knee (i.e., affecting both legs), then it is no longer there unless dismissed and released to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	 And the method of striking a member is either by striking it or holding down and restraining its lower extremity so that you can strike (it), while holding another ligament above where it is to be struck.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	 And he extends the ministering one limb downward and the other upward so that they can strike (it) from different sides
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	 "And you cut through the flesh that is between two tendons with a sickle; then remove the whole limb.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	 "After which, it can be incised or ligatured (tied off).
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	 "And you should apply linen bandages to all the parts of the limb that are not affected by the injury; and do not bind off (ligature) the sound part of the limb, lest a coldness be added to the coldness.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	 "If the inner flow of blood is lost during work (surgery), then seal it immediately or temporarily; and place something to stop those veins from ejecting blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	 "Then proceed with your medications until they are complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 "After which, tie the damaged limb with a suitable ligature to it; and care for it, so that it may become sound again.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	 "And I will tell you what happened with the blade on your foot as well; this is what happened to me.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	 "It is because the blade on my foot became black due to soot from the fire; and the corruption began first with my finger, until it reached the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	 "Therefore the man put himself under fire, after he had felt the corruption begin to affect his limb with its heat; and it caused him pain as well, and soot on him, until it incised itself into a ligature, and became sound.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	 "And after that he had waited for a very long time, the same corruption began again on his finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	 "Therefore he came to me and sought to recover the excess with that which I had placed on his hand from post-operative medicines; yet there was no overflow of fluids, and it began to cut into another finger until it reached corruption on his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	 "Therefore he came to me and sought to incise his hand; yet he did not want that from me after the overflow of fluids; I was also afraid, and even over him at the cutting of his own hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	 "Because the art was above a case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	 "Afterwards, because of my despair, I returned to the ground and came back towards you; for he had chosen him, and cut off his hand completely; and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	 "And do not tell this story except for the sake of an aide to one who fell by reason of his eagerness; and so that it may be understood as is its meaning.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	 "Of caring for wounds, and the quality of a plasterer with medicines.
Caput XC.	 The end
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	 "When an apostle falls into certain parts of the body which are dead and remain stretched out, until he collects them; then it is torn off or perforated and taken away from him what was from his flesh [from the body], so that the place remains empty as if it were a piece of cloth: but the skin over it like a garment that has already been made thin. And it does not come to its final end in corruption, nor does it print into the mouth or nose, nor into the tendons; and it is called Sinus [vein] until he stretches out the space from him; then if the perforation is printed upon something of his members, then it is called Fistula.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	 "And its care is that he cuts off completely like it was torn; and especially when it is thin and made as a cloth: and because of his faith [that the wound] did not remain with place, on account of his corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	 "But if the space adheres to the skin and it does not follow from him corruption that last connection; and if a cut is thinness of flesh, then he cares for [the care] with Clister; and it is so that you may consider Ad Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	 "Then if it is large and what it is emitted from him is foetid odor; then Clisterize the plaster with medicines such as vinegar, oil, and wine, taken by equal parts, are added to his clothes; they decrease over fire until the medicine burns away: and he goes in thinness of the flesh.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	 "Then take what is necessary for you from him and dissolve it with water and honey; bind it together with the sinew (or tendon) of a dog's tail, and then insert it into his anus. After that, wash off all the filth by pouring vinegar on it.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	 "After taking what is necessary for you from him and dissolving it with water and honey, stretch (or extend) it over three days until the anus is cleansed, and then remove all the smell.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	 "When you have bound the sinew with water and honey and stretched (or extended) it over several days until he no longer has the medicine available to him; take another cord made of wood or reeds, tie it on top of the first one, and pour water over them both.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	 "After that, remove this one as well, and when you have bound it with it, until the anus is clean (or has been cleansed).
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	 "If the tolerance for the Egyptian medicine is not present or if you do not have water and honey to dissolve it with, then bind him up with water and honey until something from a jar has been mixed into it.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	 "Or bind him up with honey and wine mixed together, because of the shortage of honey; cleanse it thoroughly, and then pour vinegar on it to remove the excess filthiness.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	 "When you have bound him many times and he has already been cleaned out of the anus; then bind him up with what makes birth to meat within him.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	 "And it is so that you take from the seal of a dog's earwax and dissolve it with oil and vinegar; or bind him up with certain medicines and ointments whose properties I have written down in my treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	 "If the anus is constricted so that no cannula can be inserted through it; then stretch him up with stronger iron until...
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	 "And similarly if it is a wide opening, then tie his lips together with stitches; and you remove from him the quantity by which he should be inserted without an additional binder.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	 "Similarly if the fistula through which it flows is sealed off or obstructed by a tumor, then it must be incised and opened up to its upper part. Afterward, it should be lowered into an inferior position within that same fistula, so as for it to drain out pus from below upwards: because when pus accumulates in great quantity in the sinus (the fistula), it prevents meat from being generated inside.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 "If you are unable to drain the fistula from below as mentioned earlier, then you must cut into it and prepare a member of skin for drainage that way. The skin membrane will drain with ease because you prepared it previously.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	 "When making the incision into the fistula, make sure nothing is retained from the pus throughout it entirely; and take remedies that are set down above the incision to help with that.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	 "And extend them (the remedies) over the skin flap.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	 "The skin flap should be of such quantity that it allows for a complete communication with the entire fistula.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	 "Afterwards make an incision into the opening of the fistula itself, making it larger than before.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	 "Then extend another skin flap with the help of your fingers from above and onto the first flap as much as you can; and place it on top of that opening in a long distance so that pus may be drained out through it: but do not use a large flap unless several days have passed.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	 "The flap that is on the opening of the fistula should be such that it may drain out whatever accumulates in it from pus at any time; and you know that the passage through which it flows is very long or short, whether it digests or does not digest.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	 "And with this thought consider the place of the fistula itself; if its lord is there and feels pain or no pain, whether it has a hole or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	 "As a result of this thought, your treatment will proceed just like that; and you know the matter that is to be placed over the opening of the fistula there, then you know it has already adhered or is approaching adhesion: so then fix it on its own head, or at the third day. And when only one flap is removed, then exchange the flaps and restore the fingers.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	 If the arrow is shot from you through a long space, then don't despair over his fall, for his healing will come about, because there are people who delay the generation of their tools in wounds to them and those who help him get back up against this
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	 If it is shot from you after a long time has passed, then you know that his fall won't happen
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	 So if the delay is long enough for his fall to happen, and it continues on, then add to their healing medicines made by doctors, so that medicine itself is moist like human flesh, and its virtue is like cold water: as a dyafine ointment when added brings more oil to it.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	 And if you have reached the very end of his healing, then get him a dyafine ointment and mix it with oil that is as dark as roast meat, so that old wine will pour over him into his body.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	 Then take him and use him.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	 And when you haven't put the dyafine ointment on him yet, then when you mix it with water and apply it to his body, he will become very sticky, and it will stick to him.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	 Or take myrrh mixed with aloes and oil, apply all of them together on top of his body when he's over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	 Then tie a bandage over him and bind it to the altar of Sinam; then take what you made and bind that on top of him too, until he becomes very sticky; after that, apply the bandage with its species, lay it on top of him, and bind him as well.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	 And sometimes when you give him long aristolochia or roots of the starry lily and lily of the valley, and strew flour from herbs such as centaur's tail feathers and centaureae
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	 Use them simply or together; tie that one on too; after you've done that, apply it to him.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If the delay continues for Sinus and his healing doesn't happen from this way, then you know that corruption is deep inside him; or he makes a mark on bones or other tough parts of his body like ligaments; at that time treat him with Fistularis's care, according to what was prescribed before.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	 On the care of the finger nails and calluses, and cutting off the added fingers, and sectioning.
Caput XCI.	 Chapter 100
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	 The nail begins to grow under the finger of the hand or foot; but it may also be born on one of the other fingers as well.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	 As a result of this, its growth is stopped; and the care for it is neglected; and it falls off from heat applied by another finger or foot; then, if completely corrupted, it may fall through to the mouth: and if only partially corrupted, corruption may occur in the nose as well. And so, on account of corruption a part may become very long until it is eaten away by corruption itself; and if color occurs because of corruption, its color becomes dark (fuscus).
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	 When therefore you care for it according to what we discussed about cutting off; do not neglect your care at all: then it is necessary that you strike with iron the remaining excess from under its nail (nail clipping).
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	 Then, cauterize the wound after this.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	 The cautery is made of iron.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 If the mouth is healthy and also the nail itself is healthy; then the calluses of the fingers begin to bite into flesh towards the inside, they start to prick themselves, and wound them: it is necessary that you apply a small quantity of Radium underneath an angle of the finger which pricked the flesh, and so draw her upwards onto herself. And strike off her with ease, put above what remains from the flesh by means of the medical instruments used, by corrosion; until everything about him is removed completely.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with a remedy, until it becomes healthy.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	 If already corruption has appeared on the mouth, then you must strike it off and remove it; for otherwise he will never become healthy as long as it is present in him.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	 If you see signs of corruption and mutilation on a finger, then strike it off with an iron tool as was previously stated for him.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore heal it
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 If the injury is to a finger or thumb, then there will be pain and swelling; therefore it should first be treated by the phlebotomist who must examine him carefully.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	 Then slice off the finger or thumb, up to the base, with an acute knife across it; so that you may remove its flesh and bring its pieces here for me.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	 And hold it so that the cut doesn't reach into the flesh below the finger; because you will cause great pain if you strike it on the swollen part of the limb where I am working, and it will be necessary to set aside any flesh added there at birth.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	 Then treat the place that is causing pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	 The fingers or thumbs are born whole and complete; they may be damaged, however, and their bones remain the same; they have nails as well: some people are born with their nails cut off at birth, even if it's just a slight nick or a scratch.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	 The one born with their nails cut off at birth cannot move; and the one born from a broken finger must be moved by someone else.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	 As for those whose fingers or thumbs are harmed: it's easy to slice them off.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	 It is so that you strike at the base of its finger with a broad knife blade;
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	 The care for those born from the opening of their fingers is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	 Avoid making a cut on it;
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	 If the injury is to the tip of one finger at the very end of its digits, then you must cut it off first with a round knife blade up to the nose.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	 Then put them into jars with the other surgical instruments for me;
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore heal it.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	 Consolidation can occur through injuries or from the birth of people, that is: when it happens with them, or by the healing of wounds, or by fire and other things like this.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	 "Therefore let's complete that connection and afterwards [then] straighten out the fingers according to their own natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	 Next, put a small bandage soaked with olive oil between them to prevent friction and separate the fingers gently in order to make sure that they are properly aligned according to what is required.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	 And similarly if the connection is made with one finger and a palm, then dry that connection afterwards according to what has been prepared and bring them into shape of their members.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	 On cutting off the skin
Caput XCII.	 Head XVI
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	 Veins are often filled with melancholy fluids that accumulate in several parts of the body; and most frequently they appear on the face (especially on the cheeks) but can also be found on the hands: especially on the ears of those who work or labor, as well as the ones who bring things to others.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	 Therefore let you administer a strong purging from black bile occasionally in order to get rid of that heaviness.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	 Afterwards, take out the base of the patient's vein from the body using tweezers.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	 The cure for them is done in two different ways.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	 The first method is to let the vein dry and become hard, after which it will be possible to cut away any excess flesh that might remain; the second method is to drain off black blood from them using a knife.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	 The other way is to take out the vein completely and let it dry on its own.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The cut for them has two methods: either you can open up their skin in order to remove any excess flesh that might remain, or you can use a knife to cut away the vein.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	 First squeeze them gently with warm water until the thick and foul blood is resolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	 Next, take their feet and gently lift up one of them to the upper portion of their thigh; then hold it in place with a bandage from below down to just above the knee.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	 Afterwards let you dry off that part either by one cut or two cuts or three cuts made wide open.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 Afterwards let you remove the blood from your hand down to its top by squeezing it gently; afterwards lift up their leg and take out the blood from above downwards on them first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	 After removing the skin and below it goes: until a certain quantity of blood is reached that you can endure with safety, and as much endurance as the virtue of the patient allows.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	 Follow the vein until he has been held back by his food and drink causing night-time (choleric) illness. And then repeat evacuation and phlebotomy when the vein is complete to prevent this weakness from occurring.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	 This method of removal can be done in that manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	 If the patient has many hairs on his chest (axilla), shave them first
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	 After that introduce him into the bath; either shave him with warm water or wrap him in a hot towel until he rouses up (becomes conscious), and the veins will be stirred. Or you may exercise vigorously if there is no present bath to heat the member.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	 After that remove the skin along the vein's length or shave him at his knee and ankle.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	 Then remove the skin with the fingers, and scrape away every part until you see him (the patient) again; this is to prevent a recurrence of night-time illness.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	 After that make him sit up on his back with the skin removed and the bed sheet over him as if it were a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	 After that introduce under the lamp (Radium) until he is completely free of skin; hold him with your fingers and gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	 And after that remove another area along its length with three digits.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	 Then scrape away the upper part of the skin until you see him again.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	 After that make her sit up on her back with the skin removed and the bed sheet over her as before; hold her gently with your fingers just like you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	 And after that remove another area or more if necessary.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	 Then remove the last area from his ankle.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	 And after that take her to an area which is above her (i.e., a higher level).
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	 Cut it out from a section that is above or to one of higher sections and when you have cut all around, then strike her.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	 If you cannot remove it yourself and need assistance, then introduce the double file gently with both hands, bind her, and remove her in that way; or introduce a smaller instrument underneath (a "Radium"), tie it around, and remove them together: either way, place your hand on all parts of her to make sure she is removed.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	 And let this happen.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	 If it fails, you will find that removing her is very difficult and painful.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 When you have completely removed her: then place a cloth soaked with wine and olive oil over the area where she has been to soak up any remaining blood or fluids; if necessary use olive oil only, and take care of it until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	 If the wine has been contracted and you are holding a piece of cloth soaked with its flow that fits into her, but it is not as we described according to rectitude: then let him find a way to place it on all parts of her torturousness (the wound) and apply the solutions for these wounds.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	 After that tie her up with cords until you have completely removed her; and also ensure there is no cut or wound in the section where she was located, unless it is necessary to use something else; for this will be very difficult for you to remove her after all.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	 So act prudently.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	 Form of the wounds being healed by wine.
Forma Vncini caeci.	 Shape of cutting off the eye, and you are done.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 It is not as smooth and fine as the others; it is also acute in its extremity so that she did not need to be removed yet; but it is very broad and flexible, being soft when necessary, so excessive force was needed for her removal, like we said before.
De extractione Venae cruris.	 Removal of the veins on the leg
Caput XCIII.	 The end of the book.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	 This is a translation from an Arabic text on surgery by Albucasis and it means: The veins are generated in the limbs with warm blood, like those of Alizegi, as well as the earth of the Arabs and the arid lands, with hot blood, the tender shrubs; that is, none of them generate herbs or trees.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	 Perhaps they are generated in other parts of the body besides limbs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	 The generation of that is due to the decay which happens under the skin, just like how snakes and lice enter into the bodies of people, but in turn also they cause generations within the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	 The mark of the beginning of this vein is that it causes inflammation on the inflamed limb.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	 Then it goes away from the place.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	 Then this vein leaves its location as if to be a root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	 When therefore this extremity of the vein appears from it then is required to come up and go over on that very limb as if it were a rope, whose length is equal to two drachmas two nadirs; and let him drop down to two drachmas two nadirs: and let him hold his breath until he drops the suspended weight from the limb.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	 When therefore a certain amount of that vein is drawn out to the outside then let him pull it down with all his strength into the weight; and let him release what he has pulled down.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	 If however the vein is prolonged much then it shall cut off a certain portion of its own length and pull down the remainder
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	 And do not cut off before he has drawn out all of that vein.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	 Since it is cut off then retracts and goes into the flesh; and makes to sting a point of the arm, and causes decay in that place, and an ulcer forms.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	 Therefore it is required that he be pulled out slowly and carefully so as to leave the last part of its own length, until after being drawn all at once from its last end; and nothing remains within or on that vein in the body: and therefore this very vein will be found among certain men who are in length five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	 And a finger was brought to me because it had been cut off from its hand.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	 If your finger is cut off at the time of your medication: then introduce a remedy into its hole and perforate it with long force until all that is within her has been extracted from the material, after which you must administer the cure for the corruption in place along with remedies on specific days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	 Therefore take care of your finger's healing immediately
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	 And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it is seen at the incision of the foot (or ankle), or itself on the foot, for openings are made to it often, and from all these openings its course goes out
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	 Therefore take care of this one as we said in the foot's incision, and with what has been removed from it
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	 In order to cure a bite by worms placed on you: and there is called Aegiruddy-buggy
Caput XCIIII.	 The head XIV.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	 The name Aegiruddy-buggy is given to it at our place because many worms have bitten into it and one has been born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	 It is introduced into the entire body, rising and falling; and it is shown to those walking by him from member to member until its fall has occurred wherever or whenever it falls on you and it is removed.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	 Its generation comes out of corrupt matter mixed with various humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	 Just like worms and snakes are cut off from the belly: so too, lice and scabies are removed from within the body.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	 Fear arises out of its badness.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	 Because when he introduced himself into the body and is extracted to the head and place, then perhaps it opens up in him and is removed, and destroys the eye; and many are destroyed from that
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	 With so you take care of him, and remove him, then it is not possible for this unless he appears to the walking by him senses.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	 "Therefore, in order that you may draw what is above it and what is below it with a strong ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then dry the above mentioned thing (the ligature), and extract from it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	 If it penetrates into the flesh, but not your hand; then place on top of a location with fire until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	 As for what you are more afraid of, that is his corruption, which has blinded him, just as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	 If then you see it already penetrating towards the eye or near to it, then draw a good strong ligature below it
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then dry above mentioned thing (the ligature), and extract from it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	 It is necessary that the weakened body of the man should be made fresh with the help of medicines, lest bad smells come out through the pores of his body.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	 And let him eat from foods which cause decay.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	 Of the cutting above the disease called Nakir.
Caput XCV.	 Hundred and fifty-first part of the work (?).
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	 This disease is called Nakir in our land; and there is pain which happened to some parts; then it is changed from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And I also saw this thing already (the ligature), as you have said.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	 I am called to a weak woman in some old age.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	 He loses his arm and sees swelling of the veins in the new branches of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	 And after some time passed, I saw a swelling to come with the fire as it comes from veins; and ascending towards his upper arm location which can be; so that he is like gold flowing when it runs from one place to another.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	 Therefore the pain went away at this location, and was fixed on his shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	 After some time passed, he began to flow again through the remaining body; until it flows into another limb.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	 Therefore I told him because everything was happening in his entire body as I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	 "I am making an incision in order to separate its member from another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	 "And I, being ignorant of that particular method before this lesson, saw it thus with my eyes.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	 "However many have learned the art of separating one member from another; but I saw it not as you did with him, when you showed me on a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	 "I do not think this to be true unless I see that one member is extracted from another by those who are skilled in the art of removing dry flesh; hence it appears to me the delight of such a transformation.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	 "It is necessary that this method does not appear as delightful to those who are not skilled or have no feeling for the art of removing dry flesh; and so it may be seen.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	 "Now that you are the master of this art and have felt the pain, perhaps it will be seen by your eye as we have shown; then tie it above him with a knot and beneath him too; dry over it and away it goes; and leave the cut place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	 "If you do not see it with your eyes then cure it as with the removal of flesh, and with what he expelled sweetness; or bind them up to remove them quickly; and cauterize the place.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	 "On the art of removing veins
Caput XCVI.	 Chapter 66
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	 Veins are removed differently according to their nature and the place where they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	 Their difference is this; for some of them have large cusps and are rough or hairy while others have small ones that are smooth or hairless.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	 And there are those that have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	 And there are veins that come from the mouth.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	 And some of them are from stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	 The veins removed according to the members in which they fall is done according to two different ways.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	 Or the main veins are removed from the principal members such as the brain and heart and liver and lungs and kidneys and intestines and urinary passages; and similarly those.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	 When a member of the body has fallen to you and it is clear that death is at hand, I am about to tell you what signs must be taken away from there, so you can take out its arrow, for death follows him where he lies, in many positions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	 And when these signs are bad and the arrow is not withdrawn from deep within a member, then withdraw it, and look after the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	 When the arrow falls into the brain and penetrates deeply, it is said: Because these things happen to him as a result of falling from that height [i.e., from above]: blindness, and turning blind to others; vertigo in his head, and redness in his eyes; swelling up in his tongue, and spasming in his head, and disturbance in his mind, and death by cholera.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	 And perhaps [therefore] the blood may come from the nostrils or the ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	 Perhaps it is withdrawn and destroyed speech.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	 And because of the white dew from the hollows [of his body] he may lose consciousness.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	 And as a result of this, similar to that which occurs in the limbs, it is said: He exits by a loss of bodily fluid.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	 If you see these signs then stay away from the care and withdraw the arrow if it is not withdrawn already.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	 The arrow signs when it falls into the heart are as follows: It is said that this one was near the left nipple and felt as if it were fixed deeply to a hard object but not to a soft one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	 And perhaps the arrow movement is similar to that of a pulse and its course follows through the blood with blackness [i.e., death].
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	 It also follows these things: it causes frost in the extremities, cold sweat, and syncope.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	 Therefore, you know that death is near but far off [i.e., imminent].
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	 The arrow sign when it was shot into the lung is as follows: It causes death by blood spurting from the wound and the veins collapse, with falling to the ground; and the color of the body changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	 When a large vein is cut, its source and target are sought after for air's coldness
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	 If a vein is cut off from its origin (the heart), then the end of that vein would be towards the back, causing severe pain and great suffering throughout all the limbs.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	 If a vein is cut off from its origin (the heart) into the stomach, then the food would be digested as if it were poison
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	 If a vein is cut off from its origin (the heart) into the lungs, then it would bring out something bad and putrid from the veins or abdomen, having been disrupted.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	 There was no hope of his cure through its collection nor through extraction of the vein.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If a vein is cut off from its origin (the heart) into the bladder and it is collected urine out of her, then something bad would come out to the outside causing severe pain. That person would be mortal at that time.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	 The members are healed like a face; the collar and jaw also, and the spatula and support for the tongue, and the spine of the neck, and the ribs (costae), and the thighs (crus) heal themselves from the limbs in different positions when they did not get any blood vessel.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	 I tell you what I heard about those veins so that you may understand through it regarding your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	 Because one of the eyes was cut off from a vein to his nose and eye socket.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	 Therefore, I extracted it on the other side under his ear, and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye at all.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	 I also extracted another vein from the Judean on his ear lobe where it had been cut off under the lower eyelid of him and that vein was hidden and not reached through it but only a small part of its end towards his own wood. It was a large vein from the vein arc of the Turks, with a steel-like bend, in which no ears were
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	 The eye of Jhoor is healthy and not a cause for harm.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	 He extracted an arrow from the flesh of a Christian
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	 The arrow was Arab and it could see ears (it's unclear what this means).
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	 He therefore placed her between two guides, and she sank into his flesh.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	 I am now skilled with him, until he extracted her; then the Christian was healthy.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	 He extracted another arrow that had fallen into his flesh and we pondered about it because of its death.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	 After 30 days had passed him and nothing was changed on top of him except for something from his disposition, I placed her above the arrow; I used my skill with her, and extracted her; then he became healthy, but not a cause for harm to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	 I saw the man who shot the arrow into his back and it was closed over her.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	 After 7 years had passed she exited from the root of the thigh of him.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	 I saw a woman who shot the arrow into her flesh and it was closed over her; she remained inside of her until the arrow did not change from his dispositions or the woman did not get harmed by any of his natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	 I saw another man who shot the arrow into his face and it was closed over; she remained inside of him until he did not get a lot of pain, like that many others.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	 He extracted an arrow from the hand of the King that had fallen into his nasal cavity and it was declining toward the right side; she was hidden completely.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	 I am now skilled at his care after the arrow incident until 3 days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	 The arrow wound was closed tightly.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	 I asked him with a gentle touch and he did not feel her; himself also felt the pain and the discomfort from his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	 I pierced it with a point at its extreme tip
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	 I extracted it from the place where its virtue had been attracted by a bandage and digested. By my confidence that this place would revert to me, and there appeared to me an image of the arrowhead so that I could grasp it onto the arrow. And no accident occurred at the place where the arrowhead was placed.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	 I assiduously worked with the bandage over several days: and no accident occurred; it was consolidated into an injury temporarily; and he remained weak due to its extraction from his space of days until one day he became sensitive to the arrowhead when inserted into his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	 He told me that story.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	 I placed the bandage on that injury acutely corrosive over several days until it was opened; and when I tried to grasp it with my fingers, I felt its subtle extreme tip that clung onto a stick.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	 After that I added to the opened wound with a sharp bandage; until it appeared before us clearly its tip of the arrowhead, and remained in my space for about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	 After the wound was enlarged and I could insert my finger into it; grasp it; but it would not obey me to leave: thus I did continue with subtlety, and attempt to grasp her with the methods of beginners until one day when I made a more forceful effort using my fingers as though they were stronger than hers at the end of the chapter, she was then extracted.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	 After that, I restored the wound
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	 But the physicians say cartilage of the nose cannot be restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	 I therefore returned to that wound and it was consolidated back into its place; he became healthy with an integral body without anything happening to him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	 And I say to you the quality of extracting arrows some day; so that you put it in regulation and meaning over what was not mentioned.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	 Since the parts of this art and their distinctiveness are not comprehended with narration; nor was it comprehended by that liber [book], or wise craftsman compares to little in excess: and when he is present, above what is absent from him; and a new operation occurred along with a new instrument among the descent of things extraneous to this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	 "Therefore I conclude that arrows are not shot from the parts of the body to which they are attached except in two modes.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	 "Or through an attraction caused by a place where it had entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	 Or otherwise another part's, the first being reversed.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	 "The one which enters where it had entered either proceeds from that place, or is an arrow shot at a dead spot, drawing towards itself and shooting out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	 "If it does not move towards its exit when it fell there, then you have to remove it a few days later until the body that is around him putrefies, and this attraction will be removed from him, but his exiting.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	 "And similarly if it is drawn into bone and does not proceed towards its exit for you, then remove her also a few days later, and repeat the same with attraction and movement every day until she shoots out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	 "If it does not move towards its exit after a day, then you have to remove the arrows from all around them on that bone until they are increased.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	 "Then draw her out and remove her.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	 "If an arrow is fixed to the skull bone and has gone through one ventricle of the brain, as I mentioned earlier, then you should abstain from drawing arrows for him, and remove her until he becomes equal after another day.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	 "If an arrow penetrates into it [the carotid artery], the death of that person is not prolonged anymore.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	 "If the arrow is not fixed just to the bones of his body and did not penetrate until it got into the carotid artery, then he was sick for a while but nothing like that happened to him from those accidents [injuries], then you have to think about drawing arrows and removing her.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	 "If it is fixed to the exit point and does not proceed towards your attraction [to attract him], then you should administer a terebela around those arrows just as I mentioned earlier, like this, until you cure the place.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	 If the arrow has already been shot through the body and is hidden from view by its own force or that of another object, then it should be grasped with one's hand while pulling
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	 If you feel the arrow, then grasp it using certain instruments that are used to extract or remove it from its path
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	 If you are unable to grasp the arrow because of its strength or because it is too deeply embedded in a wound, then search for an instrument that can make it possible to extract the arrow from its path and remove it from the wound's depth
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	 If you have ears that hold it fast, then free the limb from these around all parts with every possible means to do so, and if the mind is unable to release the flesh by tearing or bending its ears, until you succeed in removing this by any means possible to find.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	 And when you are administering the extraction of an arrow at any place, then use your hand's force with fingers to all parts until you succeed in removing it: and lastly with the most subtle subtlety so that the arrow won't be broken and makes it difficult for you to grasp it and extract it.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	 If you are unable to remove the arrow immediately but instead release it for a certain number of days until its decomposition occurs around where it is embedded.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	 Next time you come across this arrow, then use what we mentioned from the chapter on maintenance and watch for your strength to be maintained by not cutting through flesh or bone.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	 And administer the mind in every way possible for you to extract an arrow from it: and let this be done with ease, tranquility, delay or firmness as we have taught you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	 And it is necessary that when grasping the arrow, its weakness should be according to shape as it was at the time of shooting.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	 Because this has been explained more clearly
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	 If you are unable to do what we have taught you in the chapter on maintenance, then administer with figures what is possible for you.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	 A needle that is drawn from the opposite side, or has proceeded from it to something on the outside; or causes deformation of the arrow due to it passing through a nearby skin part and thereby becomes prominent; so therefore cut off this excess above it, and then proceed according to how much space there is for cutting with the fingers.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	 Then draw (the needle) out of her thus easily by exiting from within her.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	 If you want to grasp it by bone, then bend your hand according to its roundness until you have inserted the arrow into the bone and it has been amplified for yourself; thereafter draw out that same one [the needle].
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	 And if not so, release her after a certain number of days until she returns to you again.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	 If the wood is in there [the arrow], then pull (her) with it [the wood].
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	 If the wood has perished and you wish to administer the thrust: then introduce into her an instrument with a concavity so that it may be inserted through its concavity, into the arrow shaft; thereafter pull (her) along with him [the wood].
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	 If the arrow is concave: then pull her along with an instrument entering through that same one.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	 The arrow pierces (her) by this way [that is, she is pulled out].
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	 If the arrow has been poisoned, then you must, so as to cut through the entire piece of meat that it is located in; if possible for you [that is, if you have the necessary tool].
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	 Then take care of her with respect to what will be necessary for this thing [that is, perform first aid on her].
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	 If the arrow falls into the breast [heart], or the belly, or the groin, or the thigh; and is close to that which you take hold of when attempting to draw her out: it is possible for you to cut off above her with a knife (or to tear), so as to remove her.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	 If you are able, then take care of the wound and see that it is healed [that is, bandage the wound].
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	 This is the shape of a snare (trap) from which hooks are drawn out by means of an arrow
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	 The hands and feet resemble claws that grasp iron rods when they are held over arrows but do not let go of them when the arrows pass through.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	 And many forms arise from them, great and small, according to the amount of arrows and their power, and in their variety; for they grasp with varying tightness as the arrows pass through them.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	 Shape of the extractor hook.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	 Shape of the snare (trap) is closed, ready to trap a creature that can't escape when it hits the arrow shaft.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	 This is the shape of the snare (trap) like a hoop to hold it when entering and guiding through with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	 The shape of the snare (trap) is like a bird's claw to hold it when entering and guide through with it, so that its entrance into the arrow shaft occurs smoothly and pushes it on.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	 On phlebotomy of veins.
Caput XCVII.	 Chapter 70 of [book].
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	 Veins which are customarily introduced into the body number thirty.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	 Among which veins at the head there are six ten, two behind ears called herbae, two behind eyes called aspicientes, and one on each side above the nose; and one in the tip of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	 And two guides (veins) which are in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	 And two veins which are in the upper lip of each side of the mouth.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	 And two veins which are in the lower lip of each side of the mouth.
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	 These are called algecherich veins.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	 And two veins which are under the tongue on each side.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	 Veins which are introduced into arms there are five for every arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	 The left cephalic vein is located on the right side of the head; and named by the Latin word for head (capitis).
Et Fusca.	 "And there is blood.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	 It is flesh; it is composed of a part from the base of the temple and another from the skull's branch. And you should call this by its proper name 'the body'.
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	 It is flesh; it is placed on the lower part of the home. And it is also called 'Titillarum'.
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	 Call this by its proper name, 'the belly'.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	 It is flesh; it is placed above the fire. And that from which blood flows, and that on which the hand appears when pressed, are they.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	 The navel; there are two branches to it.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	 In the thigh and in the calf, three of them exist.
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	 It is flesh; it is placed under the thumb's curve from the lower side.
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	 The second one is called 'Saphena', and its place is at the back of the calf, near the ankle.
Et uena Nesse: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 There is another one; it's name is 'Nesse'. And its place is on the back of the calf, at the ankle.
Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	 The other thigh also has three branches like them.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	 About the flow of blood from two veins after the elbow.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	 About two veins that flow blood after the elbow; it is a remedy for catarrh of old times, and against hemorrhoid disease, it makes the head ulcer bad.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	 The quality of their flow is according to what they carry.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	 It should be applied with a good cloth on the head; and it should be pressed against its veins at their place to stop them.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	 Then the patient puts his neck straight up with a stick, so that two of them appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	 The places where they are located after the elbow, on both sides of the head, are depressed.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	 Ask them with your finger; and when you feel their pulse under it, apply a signet ring there with a hot iron.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	 After taking hold of a syringe and drawing out its contents, there is the person known as Incidents
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	 After introducing this into a vein through a needle and connecting it to the blood vessels, after the injection has taken place.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	 After placing your hand on top of it and piercing through with a needle at the point of entry (into the vein).
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	 The length of the incision depends on the number of fingers involved in piercing it through or around it; make an incision to let out as much blood as possible.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	 After wrapping this with bandages and removing them, after the wound has been bandaged up.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	 And also remember at the beginning of a book to make an incision (of the veins) and burn those.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	 Of two arteries in the time it takes for them
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	 The two arteries that are pierced by the injection of blood take twice as long; first, to bleed slowly and then to flow quickly, until both fluids have been emptied from them into the eyes (of the person piercing or administering).
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	 The quality of the injection is according as you narrow your opening for it.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	 A person who has been weakened should bandage their arm much so that two veins will be visible to the appearance; and it is likely for them to beat a pulse under your finger when you touch them.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	 Then, with burning coals
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	 After placing the finger on top of it and piercing through with a needle at the point of entry (into the vein), after removing that from above, you will have introduced another one into the same vein.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 Pierce this one as you did with the two others; make it flow out of blood according to how much is needed for your needs.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	 After wrapping around a weak vein and placing your finger on top of it during one hour
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	 After placing the bandage over this one tightly with strong constriction and removing them, after the wound has been bandaged up.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	 And also remember at the beginning of a book to make an incision of their veins and to remove those in the beginning of the book.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	 On the removal of a vein in front of an incision made for removing the brain
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae uenae frontis est post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad aegritudines faciei antiquas: et ad hemigraneam, et rubedinem: et ulcera foeda.	 In order to remove a vein in front of an incision made for removing the brain, it is necessary first to make the incision for removing the brain; and after that you will be able to apply cold water on the face, and then move up and down (the vein); and afterwards press upon it with your finger, so as to squeeze out the blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, secundum quod narro tibi.	 The quality of the removed vein is such that you can narrow them by using your fingers.
Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	 If a man falls down while he is drinking water, until his head appears again.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	 Then you will take the tool that is called an "Fossorium".
Cuius haec est forma.	 The shape of this tool is such that it can be used to remove veins and also draw blood from them.
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	 With the top part of the "Fossorium" you should press against this vein from above with your finger or with another object, so as to squeeze out blood; and then release it while drawing it in according to the quantity that is necessary for this process.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	 Then you should make a small incision on it, and hold tight until it heals.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	 And sometimes when the vein is opened with the "Fossorium" on one side.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	 However it should not be so that you make an incision at the end of a vein as sharp and sudden as when removing others, but rather let it come to an end gradually.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	 And you should remove the vein by turning on that side, as its position is next to one of your fingers; and there may be a risk that when it is soft and gentle with the "Fossorium" will break away or fall off.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	 On the removal of veins from two lachrymal canals (the tear ducts).
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	 In order to remove veins from the two tear ducts of both eyes you need first a small incision on each side at the corner of the eye; and afterwards apply cold water on the eye, and then move up and down with your fingers over it, so as to squeeze out the blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	 The quality of these veins is such that you can narrow them by using your fingers.
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	 Then you should remove the veins; and with both hands hold tightly over his head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	 "In order for a vein to be cut short and as short as possible without using scissors that are too small or too large, the veins should be cut at an equal length.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	 "If a phlebotomist cuts off a vein in half then it will break (in two).
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	 "After that you should draw out blood from the patient as much as is necessary.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	 "Put a bandage over them and bind them up at night every day.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	 "In the case of removing veins from patients who have many veins (like in the hand).
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	 "In the case of removing veins from patients who have many veins (like in the hand), this will cause fever and chills, and a burning sensation on the face. This is particularly true when the patient has old scars.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	 "The quality of the phlebotomy should be such that it leaves the patient weak in their lower half (like in a leg).
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	 "After that you should hold the patient's left hand and take a fine phlebotomist with a long needle; then pierce it at its junction (between the thumb and index finger).
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	 "Because one finger does not feel anything there because blood starts to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	 "And it is necessary that you hold your hand with a phlebotomist longer and draw out blood from the patient according to your needs.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	 "Then bind them up at night every day.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	 "The cut will heal quickly or not.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	 "In the case of removing veins from guide-patients (like in the foot).
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	 "In the case of removing veins from guide-patients (like in the foot), there is a strong desire to constrict them and get rid of leprosy sores on their feet.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	 "The quality of the phlebotomy for guide-patients (like in the foot) is such that it leaves them weak on both sides and they will lie flat.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	 "In the case of removing veins from patients with many veins, you should cut a vein to its maximum length without using scissors that are too small or too large.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	 "Then you should extract from blood a certain quantity of heat.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	 Afterwards do the same with another vein
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	 After this, apply a ligature to both veins and tighten them in such a way that the weaker of the two will not be weakened.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	 And then remove it from its head.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	 Then cleanse the wound.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	 "The art of bleeding veins by Albucasis.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	 The art of bleeding veins by Albucasis is as follows: when you are about to bleed a vein, and the vein gets into your mouth or nose, do not let it go down your throat; instead, cleanse with a sponge soaked in alcohol, remove any bad ulcers from the gums, and clean wounds on face, arms, and any other part of his body.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	 The quality of bleeding veins is that you should let the patient remain in a lying position before doing so; and tie down his head with a cord.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	 Afterwards remove his lips and look at both veins closely; one of them will be in the right lower lip, and the other in the left side of his neck; their demonstration is through black marks on either side.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	 It should be done this way because veins are minute, dark-colored markings can be seen in the surroundings.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	 Then cut off both of them with one stroke.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	 If there is doubt on your part or you do not know which veins are being referred to here, then intend a larger cut and one that shows the veins more clearly.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	 And do similarly to both veins on the upper lip and customarily with that, and make two cuts from the lower lip as well.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	 "The art of bleeding veins under the tongue after cephalic vein.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	 The two veins under the tongue are being referred to here; it is important that the art of bleeding the cephalic vein has been done before this one.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	 The quality of bleeding them is that the patient should remain in your hands facing you; lift up his tongue from the left side and look at one vein on the right side, then do the same for the other vein; their demonstration is through black marks both sides.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	 Phlebitis, therefore both of them keep watch, lest your hand be cut off by phlebotomy
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	 They are veins (arteries). It is possible that the flow of blood may be hindered from these veins (arteries).
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	 Of three veins in a bundle.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	 The three veins that are commonly used to tie up into a bundle for phlebotomy (bloodletting) are found throughout all humans.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	 The bloodletting of these veins can be done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	 Either by piercing with a lancet and applying the cupped hand to the vein or by gently pulling out while using a small knife (or spoon): or by cutting off part of the vein with a phlebotomist's tool.
Et haec est forma eius.	 This is their form for this purpose.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	 Thus it was agreed upon as the method of cutting off or severing (removing) a vein.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	 And from these are large and small veins, depending on the size of the vein(s) and the restriction thereof. The form for using a cupped hand (myrtin) is wide as you can see it.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	 And agreed upon the opening of various types of veins (large ones, filled with blood, prominent ones, large and turgid ones, and those that contain a great deal of turbid blood).
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	 The phlebotomist is smaller in size than the veins themselves but more skilled at their operation.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	 And agreed upon the bloodletting of the smallest veins that contain clear blood (bright red).
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	 The bloodletting of the basilica or veinlet
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	 The basilica is one bundle out of three veins used in phlebotomy (bloodletting).
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	 The basilica was used to extract blood from the jugular veins underneath and around the neck, following which the chest is drawn out towards it: and the phlebotomist agreed with the phlebomant (bloodletter) that they should tie off this vein so as to close it completely, lest there be a flow of blood through or into it, because beneath it lies an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	 If the basilica should err (be damaged) and be pierced by a phlebotomist's lancet, it will hit that artery, and there may be an obstruction of blood flow.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	 "You must prevent a vein from being cut when another person is performing a phlebotomy on it.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	 If the manifestation of the basilica is not visible, then you must prevent it from being cut when another person performs a phlebotomy on it. You may either move (it) to another or seek another who can perform a phlebotomy on that vein. Or, if someone else's arm has been cut at that location, you should remove his arm and perform the phlebotomy there instead of where he was originally injured.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	 That vein is visible and must be treated as stated earlier.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	 If you are performing a phlebotomy on the same arm, then it is necessary to check for any previous injury and perform the procedure at an appropriate place until you know where that point is.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	 After the incision has been made and cauterized with a hot iron, remove the arm afterward to perform the phlebotomy on that same location as we stated earlier.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	 Prevent cuts from occurring at or near blood vessels.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	 After you've tied off the ligature and cauterized with an iron at that location, then inflation of that artery occurred; therefore remove it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	 If you see blood rising during a phlebotomy procedure, act like a child and treat it as if there is urine (bleeding), but know that it is from an artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	 After that, place your finger above the space for a long time and then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	 If you see that the blood has been cut off or is about to be cut off and then tie it back up quickly; prevent an injury by preventing sudden movement of the arm, so that there will be no shock from its movement.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 And do not let him move around for a long time until he has healed completely.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	 If the blood is not cut off and you see it coming to your finger; then strike that artery.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	 The opposite arm or hand is brought against him in order to prevent bleeding from occurring.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	 Or accept a tourniquet from the other person and find him; take one dose of medicine and tie it above that cut, with cordage and powder until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	 This is a medieval Latin translation of an Arabic medical text written by Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi in the 10th century. The translation reads "When blood is cut off, it's good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	 "However if not (i.e., when blood is not cut off), the cautery is performed upon it from its location where the previous bleeding occurred and because of the flow of the blood: and making a cut on the vein to prevent further loss, since the removal of that part might be difficult in multiple dispositions due to the narrow space available, and by ligating the artery with a bandage.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	 "Of young veins.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	 "The method for young veins is different from the old ones. The former takes blood from the superior part of the head and the inferior part of the body due to their composition being formed by the branches of the basilar artery and cephalic vein.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	 "And he cautorized it so that its blood would be taken out under tension since there is a vein underneath of it.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	 "Therefore if he added that to the phlebotomy, and a vein was found underneath it, there occurred a fall into unconsciousness due to a sudden pressure change; but its treatment became difficult, and in some cases not successful.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	 "As for many veins being present under the skin.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	 "However if veins were occulted in some men and are subtle but not visible; then it is necessary that you perform your phlebotomy as follows: first cauterize with the alnasel until the blood stops flowing, and then make a small cut on them applying your bandage forcefully.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	 "But if one vein is between two veins, then find its length first.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	 "Of the cephalic (neck) vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	 The method for young cephalic veins is different from the old ones. They take blood from the head and flow downwards towards the eyes due to their composition being formed by the branch of the basilar artery.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	 "And you should perform this one when it is present and ready; so if you're able to cautorize with the phlebotomist of oil (using olive-oil based salve), or with that of myrtle (a different kind of balm).
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	 In spite of this, if you wish to touch the veins, you should hold onto his head and gently squeeze until it becomes numb. Then, seek a more favorable location for further treatment; but do not hurt him while he is still moving as that would cause harm.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	 In some men, when the veins are not touched by a first blow (i.e., when a vein is not struck or hit), it doesn't hurt them at all; they endure it easily and without any harm.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	 Of the usefulness of phlebotomy: Pay attention to its details.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	 The quality and accidents associated with phlebotomy, which you should consider when correcting it.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	 First of all, you should know that phlebotomy is not to be administered unless for the sake of health preservation and treatment; it's also important to avoid any injury from an untimely arrival (i.e., to arrive too early).
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	 So that phlebotomy is given through the three veins which are located at the top of the arm: namely, the cephalic vein, the basilic vein, and the brachial vein.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	 So that phlebotomy is given at the beginning of fasting (i.e., before meals), or after breakfast and dinner; if it's not done within a short period of time, its effects may cause swelling.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	 So that phlebotomy is given on the first or third day after three hours have passed since the previous phlebotomy.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	 Phlebotomy administered through veins that are injured does not have a determined time limit; instead, when it's convenient and necessary to do so, you should perform it at night or during the day, or whenever there is light available.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	 And it's not appropriate that phlebotomy be performed on children until they are 14 years old.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	 A woman should not undergo phlebotomy unless she is between the fourth and seventh month of pregnancy.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	 Nor a phlebotomy should be performed on people who have already passed their 60th birthday.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	 Therefore, if someone wants to be phlebotomized through the veins located within their body, they must empty their intestines before the phlebotomy begins; otherwise, they would not have enough blood flowing out of the intestines for treatment without causing damage to other important parts of their bodies.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	 No patient will vomit while undergoing treatment; that is, no emetic or purgative will be administered without water, until the said matter is removed from him
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	 The patient shall not be given a purge (emetic)
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	 until the veins are opened up after passion and vomiting have ceased, until urine is passed, until ejaculation occurs, until fatigue and exercise cease, until meals are taken, until fasting, and all that which had been dissolved from him by virtue of his bodily or animal nature.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	 Then consider the humor before this matter; if blood is thick with foods and drinks, or medicines are used, then possibly he should do it for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	 Then enter the bath; if this does not forbid anything else, or exercise is prescribed to thin his blood,
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	 And place the phlebotomy in his heart on the third day as we said; and cleanse him from all accidents of animals, unless he has pains or is troubled by them all at once, unless he is in great pain or is troubled with superfluities, unless he is subject to labor, penalty, and excesses.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	 And let his physician be present with those whom custom and common use have accustomed to the application of aromatics, odorous substances, and perfumes; so that he may do as much by measure as is possible.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	 Then the phlebotomist shall sit on a stool of some height higher than that used for phlebotomy; afterwards he shall take his own arm and shake it twice with his right hand or three times if necessary.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	 Then he stretches the ligature while correcting, until two repetitions have been made
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	 And let the ligature be tight but not too tight; for if it is too strong or through excess of ligature, then it forbids the flow of blood; and if it is too loose, also forbids the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	 Afterwards the ligature must be released so that both hands shall simultaneously shake him until he is alive and his senses declare themselves.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	 "The phlebotomist removed a little oil from an old vein.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	 "Then he placed his finger on the left hand over it and performed a gentle tap to remove any blood that might escape if struck.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	 "After the strike was over, it remained as if a struck chord were struck and removed from the vein; after he put the finger on it, it contracted under the phlebotomist's blow but did not break or escape to be drawn out by the phlebotomist, except for that which is fully distended with air. When he placed the phlebotomist over her, she tightened beneath him and was broken, unless she escaped, in which case a strict rule applies: one must gently press on it so that the phlebotomist may draw it out as swiftly as possible.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	 "Then he removed the phlebotomist.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	 "If then a vein escapes when struck, it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	 "And if not, try another location with less force or over him with a greater force; and unless the place is struck.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	 "If he falls back then release his hand for one day or two days and do not strain the ligaments.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	 "At least make sure to strike gently.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	 "Do not let it drip into a bandage.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	 "Then he will perform another phlebotomy if he wishes.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	 "If the opening is small or only a little blood flows gently out of it; then another phlebotomy should be performed into this vein according to propriety and added with fewer operations.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	 "And do it with a tap before striking the location; for an unstruck location is struck by many phlebotomists.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	 "If you want to strike that vein again then do not continue striking on top of him; for it is no excuse for something else.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	 "And place some oil from a flask over him so as to stop the blood flow.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	 "The better is this remedy than oil alone, and more effective than remaining oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	 "In the administration of oils for all your veins during phlebotomy (bloodletting), you should also apply them to the prohibited site on the course of the blood and prevent it from bleeding; when one of these is applied over a specific place, they will form a scab quickly.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	 "Blood becomes thinner and more resolved after being coarse (clotted).
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	 "If the location of a major phlebotomy wound becomes infected and many times so happen to those who are not phlebotomized with that one type of oil alone or if there is an opening for some reason, then apply a sponge soaked in water and salt to it immediately and heat it quickly; tie it up right away.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	 "It is necessary that you apply this remedy after the blood has exited with its own complement or another one's.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	 "If anything remains in the location after a day or two of bleeding, or if it is only due to dryness; do not worry about that; and if you have some aloe, or ointment from Myrrh (a tree resin), apply it over that place; or something made with Mentha oil (such as Calamine), or something similar.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	 "Many times the wounds of phlebotomy at the Basilica are severe and deadly.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	 "Therefore, put your hand over that spot; if it occurs at the time of compression on top of that spot, then there is a severe wound.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	 "So apply something from what we mentioned above.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	 "Fortunately, blood from that artery flows easily.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	 "But apply something to him with the one where there is a stiction (clot), so he can release it and remove the clot.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 "After that cure him as soon as possible by other treatments until he recovers.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	 "It is necessary to remove all the blood from every man according to his own strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	 "And if it appears from a reddish color on the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	 If the skin is black (niger), it must be removed because it will rot and become ugly; similarly if you see a man with a bald head (grossum), shave him so that he does not become ugly either. Similarly, for an arrow wound, heal quickly to avoid causing pain or damage.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	 One must remove a full and strong man with abundant blood flow (plenus), so that the new vein's blood flow is increased, making it wide; while for a weak man who is emaciated or with low blood flow (debilis), one should perform the opposite procedure to restore his strength.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	 One must also ensure that the hole is not made too small (strictum) to prevent the vein from closing and allowing blood flow; on the other hand, if a small incision was made during phlebotomy for increasing the new vein's blood flow, it should be widened rather than closed up.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	 The proper method for phlebotomy is safe in terms of blood flow and avoids injury; the incision must be made carefully (neruis) to prevent injury, while using a narrow and long incision is considered better than one that increases or decreases length and width.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	 If you want to use a syphon for phlebotomy and prevent the syphon from falling apart while using it (syncopis), you must fill its container with warm water mixed with grated mustard before each use; if the syphon becomes too hot during use, remove it quickly from the blood vessels, at most four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	 If the skin has been injured (infregidatae complexionis), before phlebotomy you should apply a pan of mixed honey and spices or scented honey; if there is no honey available, you can use scented oil instead.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	 If the syphon falls apart during phlebotomy (accidat syncopis), it can cause a loss of blood flow, so you should fill the pot with water mixed with aromatic syrup to prevent loss; if no aromatic syrup is available, use scented oil instead; also add other ingredients mentioned in the passage about removing the syphon from use.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	 If someone wants to remove their own arm so that they can bleed more quickly and efficiently for a prolonged period (suum ultrare brachium), the phlebotomist must ensure the person's blood flow is maintained at an adequate level, as it may take longer than one day of continuous bleeding.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	 "Whoever is trying to remove his own arm, and cleanse the blood from it secondly, he shall have his body forcefully at that time.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	 "Whoever is trying to remove the blood from his own arm on one side towards the opposite direction must let it be cut off forcefully at that time, or else at the second day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	 "In whose body there is much blood already heated up and inflamed, he should make it fall from him in one way, and extract a great quantity of it: and the opening must be made with many incisions until it reaches its fullness at intervals. After you have become accustomed to all the conditions of phlebotomy, then place your hand on top of his chest where the blood flows downwards, so that there is no sudden death.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	 "Indeed this has happened when the phlebotomist was ignorant and fell into negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	 "And it is not advisable when you have already closed the opening of the arm and the blood has become difficult to extract, that you force it upwards with great effort.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	 "This removal is a bad thing, I think remove this because of the phlebotomist's negligence.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	 "Or else with a phlebotomy remove what has coagulated from the blood into an opening and put something that has been dissolved in water on top of it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	 "And put something like tyrian purple dye or saffron, or something that is tightly pressed to prevent the blood from flowing.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	 If you already have a band on it, then remove that and do not force it, until all of the finger is free.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	 "If there is a necessity to remove the second blood and it cannot be excused, then you should either perform phlebotomy above him or on another arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	 "But the forearm is phlebotomized by the fistula and basilica because they are not used to it, and they become hidden after being made composite of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	 "The quality of the phlebotomy is such that he introduces his own hand into warm water and after a while it turns red with the focus or fire, showing clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	 After which tie or bandage is applied over this, restricting blood flow only slightly.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	 The phlebotomy is repeated with a gentle and slow motion in the opposite direction to that of the first one, neither horizontally nor longitudinally, and there should be ample opening for you as you apply it over your hand.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	 If death of blood is forbidden or prohibited, then repeat the process with your own hand in warm water and let the blood flow out into the water for a while until you're needed to release it.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	 If however you are in hot days or summer time then you should excuse yourself from the repetition of hand into warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	 And more than anything else, a course of blood is placed into warm water during these times.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	 The phlebotomy today or this one is better for all veins since it does not make the hand pulse nor cause numbness in them.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	 Phlebotomy of the left hand of yours confers benefits on the right side or arm.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	 The quality of the phlebotomy is such that you tie or bandage your hand with a bandage or your own hand after introducing it into warm water until it turns red and shows clearly to the senses.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	 After tying or bandaging her, you should repeat the phlebotomy procedure again.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	 And if he completely severs this from him then there will be none of it left in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	 You should not use the hand with the phlebotomy tool after completing the procedure unless otherwise instructed by a medical professional or your doctor.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	 Under that [procedure] are the fingers of the hands torn off from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	 Repeat with your own hand into warm water and let out the blood from there.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	 If you don't repeat her into warm water then the blood will coagulate inside that opening and be prohibited from flowing out.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	 "When you remove from blood a quantity necessary for healing, then place over one (ointment) oil and salt; so that it may not be hardened.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	 And similarly, do as when the whole branch is tight [i.e., when you are dealing with a narrow cut].
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	 It is important that you do not press on the veins with your left hand because this may cause them to become swollen and painful; when dealing with cuts from bleeding, proceed similarly as before: apply oil and salt so that it does not harden.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	 You should also apply oil and salt to the veins on the lower part of the body in a similar manner as you would for swelling or pain from cuts; to avoid bruises that may occur with prolonged use (such as from varicose veins); to treat ulcers, wounds, ancient sores, or similar conditions.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	 The quality of the bandage should be such that it can be applied to your foot when immersed in hot water and will cause friction as you walk; hold above this so that you may make corrections without difficulty (i.e., adjust the bandage).
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	 The bandage should be placed on your heel and cover your toes; this will help to keep your feet warm while you are moving around [i.e., when walking].
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	 Therefore place the bandage on a wider part of his limb or at the heel; because it is better and more effective [in preventing swelling].
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	 If you place the bandage on the face of his foot then apply pressure from beneath it onto the face of his foot [i.e., to prevent bleeding].
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	 Apply your bandage so that you will strike (or hit) the veins as it passes over [i.e., move it in a way to apply pressure directly on them].
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	 If blood loss is prohibited (i.e., bleeding must be controlled), place his foot into hot water; and release the flow of blood from that foot into it [to control bleeding].
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	 If the bandage is placed at too low an elevation (i.e., if it is placed inappropriately), then you should repeat with another bandage placed higher; because this is better and will not cause harm when applying pressure to the veins as we mentioned before [to apply pressure].
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	 Similarly to the other foot
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 The sciatic nerve is located as we described it on the back of the heel (calcaneum).
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	 Its accompanying vein is connected to its pain when there is warmth because of cold blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	 The quality of its accompanying vein is such that when it becomes weak from cold water and warmth disappears; and you can stretch both legs all the way up to the top of the heel with four fingers while holding on to a very fine thread, because otherwise it would not appear until then.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	 When it appears then you can either touch or pull from the inside; and it is better to cut her off with a single stroke than to split her open with two.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	 Its location however is hidden from many people and itself is hidden among the multiple number of men.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	 If not by your touch and does not appear to everyone then the accompanying vein of that sciatic nerve is visible on another's back foot near the ear; or with a turn it can run out the quantity of blood as far as you are willing, depending upon its own power.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	 Then place a restriction around where that accompanying vein goes through and then stretch it.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	 In this way it is cured
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	 Of venesection, and the use of its quality
Caput XCVIII.	 The eighty-ninth chapter
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	 They are to be seen from the arms, ears and face.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	 Venesection however is done in two ways
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	 With scarring and the removal of blood; or another way venesection without scarring.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	 This kind of venesection which is done without scars is done in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	 Or it can be done with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	 Alternatively, it can also be done without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	 Venesection and those who administer them with scarring and the removal of blood are in thirteen places on the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	 "One vein is the vena cava, and it extends to the top of the head; there are two veins in the forehead; one vein descends from the top of each ear; there are two veins on either side of the nose; one vein goes under the chin towards the lower jaw; there are two veins at the base of the neck; there is a vein between the thumb and forefinger, which is medium for both arms.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	 "But the vena cava does not carry blood to you from thin veins scattered on your body, and this is due to its lack of power coming from these veins; thus it is caused by phlebitis.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	 "It is not necessary to administer the vena cava either with fire or without fire from any part of your body until it fills up the entire body.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	 "If a need arises to administer the vena cava due to heat or custom, we will administer it at any time during infancy, its end and in between, whenever necessary.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	 "It is so because the one who multiplies blood within him through his veins does not cease from extracting it by its administration until he is completely emptied of his load at the top of his head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	 "And there are those who fill and cover their face with blood from its own forehead, neck, and shoulders.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	 "And there are those who fill the face itself with itching, its front, darkness, and cloudiness of the eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	 "And there are those whose location for administering their own vena cava is affected by itching or other conditions.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	 "And there are those with an increased number of eruptions on the body.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	 "And there are those who fill their own mouth with the taste and feeling of blood, or whose tongue is paralyzed so that they cannot speak.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	 "And there are those with a greatly increased sleep.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	 "And there are those who see within their dream blood and its effects, as well as other things that happen.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	 When it is necessary to remove any part of the three body parts listed above, let us make incisions for removal at a time that falls between noon and two o'clock in the afternoon or three o'clock.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	 The removal of the nose is an exception to venesection (vein cutting), as it leads directly to the face and results in loss of vision
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	 At that time we should remove everything from the body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	 The removal of the nose is a location for cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	 It's not allowed to remove it if it's extremely cold or has phlegm.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	 He was given a large bandage.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	 And for that reason it is not allowed to remove it if the body part has extremely cold feelings (freezing).
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	 The one who does this repeatedly becomes an obstruction in front of him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	 And for that reason it is necessary to remove the arm when it has become an obstruction in front of him while he is performing venesection from above downwards, afraid of being obstructed by his own generation (i.e., his own limbs).
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	 Venesection or Alkehel is a location for cephalic and basilar phlebotomy, and also because of the desire to constrict (restrict) and open wounds with instruments, and in order to relieve constriction and prevent tears.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	 It is necessary to make sure that the Venesection or Alkehel is forced downwards so as not to weaken the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	 The removal of the nose or Alkehel causes pain and blindness (opthalmia), and hemigranulon (half paralysis) of the face and neck, and perforatio (perforation) and dolor (pain in the ribs). And it is a location for basilar phlebotomy.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 It is necessary to make sure that the Venesection or Alkehel does not force the hand towards it so as not to hit the artery and cause a loss of blood flow.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	 The removal of the nose or Alkehel below the chin causes damage to the tongue and gums (gingiva), and also to other parts affected by coldness in the mouth: it is a location for alternative phlebotomy on both sides of the lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	 Venous ligation
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	 Venous ligation of the lower extremity's three veins (Basilica, Fusca, and Cephalica), followed by ligating the internal jugular vein to facilitate access for blood collection from the superior vena cava through a catheter introduced into the femoral vein.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	 And it is necessary to prevent multiple punctures and cuts when the site has been exposed skin, as well as beneath there are veins and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	 Venous ligation of the superficial veins over the elbow to ligate hemorrhoids or treat minor varicose ulcers below the knee.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	 And it is necessary to perform the ligation in one long movement and make sure that all veins are closed; since the area is more susceptible to strong suction which can tear delicate veins, so a larger cut must be made for such purposes.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	 The veins of the lower extremities will be ligated with a visible decrease in size because they are drawing blood from all over the body and causing pain in the kidneys, liver, and urinary tract; as well as causing menstruation and making both orifices swell up; and there is constriction at the saphenous veins below the knee.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	 However, they will weaken the body greatly by causing many deaths in humans.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	 The internal jugular vein is close to the veins of the lower extremity ligation.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	 The quality of the position of the veins is to make them loose and soft first, then tighten them with a gradual increase in tension until they are equal on both sides; do not prolong this position too long because it may cause discomfort for those receiving blood samples and will exhaust them quickly: but after removing all obstacles so that they can move freely again.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	 Then consider the body's disposition.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	 A person whose skin is very tender and prone to bruising needs frequent bleeding at that place so as not to cause ulceration.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	 "The cauterizer is warmed up so as to increase the burn and deepen it; also for warming the suction so that it may be easier to grasp with both hands.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	 If there is excessive bleeding, then you should apply a second cautery at that time.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	 "The first incision is made in a delicate vein and to extract the blood; also in the second case, make an incision that is most skillful for removing excessive bleeding.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	 If there is foul smelling blood, then you should apply a third cautery at that time; to result in the final outcome.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	 "And when we desire to remove blood quickly and efficiently, one incision is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	 If you wish to extract blood in multiple places, make a many incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	 "If the blood is excessive then you should make a deep incision; and when both incision and depth are equal, it is at that point where the depth of the skin reaches its maximum.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	 "What should be done with the oils placed near to the area around the cautery and what is their purpose?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	 "For the skin is rough and thick, with its pores being closed; for such a person it is good to apply oil in a way that they can be rubbed vigorously, using very fine oils or oils of sweet taste like almond oil.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	 "And if the time is hot and humid then use oils that are fragrant like those of daffodils or lillies; also for these.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	 "If excessive cold is present then use oils that are bitter like those of balsam or those made from the plant called Alben; also for these.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	 "If excessive bleeding is present and the skin is tender then you should apply oil so that it may be prevented by the oil; after that, they should be washed with warm or cold water depending on what suits them better.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	 "One who has blood that is excessively moist should cleanse himself with vinegar and water or a mixture of vinegar and myrrh, just as follows.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	 "If there are excessive ones, cleanse them with a mixture of wine and water or a solution of vinegar, saffron, water of samsuci, or a decoction of anetii [aneth], or with the addition of camomilla.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	 "It is necessary that he bathe himself with vinegar or water of the bath, or from a bath towel [vestigium balneae], and it must be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	 "And it is not necessary that anyone should sleep after being washed with vinegar.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	 "What does one need to regulate the Ventosus or Phlebotomatus before cleansing?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	 "After that one should consider the following first: if a Ventosus or Phlebotomatus is choleric and there is pain in his blood or inflammation, he must take cold to soothe him just as one would crush alum [granatum muzum], with vinegar and lettuce, and secanibin, and iuleb. And do this for all of them.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	 "And he must eat [feed] his body with a food that is not too hot or cold, and cooked dishes mixed with barley, and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	 "And for someone whose constitution is cold, he must take in a bowl syrup of honey or molasses or secanibin from the seeds and drink water fragrant with middle fragrance that is between wine and dew, and should be taken sparingly because it causes an upset stomach.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	 "And he must feed his body with food that is not too harsh and does not cause indigestion, such as the flesh of pheasants or pigeons, i.e., birds eaten in moderation, and flesh from young geese.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	 "It is necessary that the vessel for cleansing and phlebotomy be large enough to hold food as well, and it must also be in a bowl of certain people whose eyes are red or inflamed from too much drinking, or medicine made from musk, i.e., muscatum, or aleesilith before the cleansing or phlebotomy, or after to comfort the principal veins and blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	 It is not permissible for them to burn her in a container [made] of embers
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	 Without incisions
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	 The members of the vagina which are without incisions should be put upon a board [made] for this purpose; and then they should be struck by an instrument on their vulvae (small lips), labia majora, labia minora, mons veneris, umbilicus, anus, and clitoridis. For these members have not undergone incision above them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	 It is not permitted for intercourse to be sought through them unless there is a contact from the member of the blood towards the member, as we put the vagina on the breast during the flow of menstrual blood; and so it must be done with regard to the vulvae.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	 We apply them that we may put cold water upon her member to cool it; as we put the vagina on the breast and the umbilicus [belly button].
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	 Because of this the member is swollen and heated up due to it; as a result it relieves pain because she has resolved [or settled] her desire for intercourse.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	 She is put on the kidneys when there occurs a stoppage within them or with a bandage.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	 By reason of her strong desire for intercourse she may either open the flow [passage] by force or remove the obstruction from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	 And similarly when she is put on top of a board and her vulva is to be gently taken away within them both.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	 The members of the vagina are administered with water only after incision, that is by pouring it over them.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	 And sometimes they are given [administered] with fire (as in cauterization).
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	 And sometimes they are given hot water to bathe [in baths] with; and it is so that the vagina should be large like a bath of warm water, or water alone that has been heated up, or water mixed with herbs which have been cooked.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	 The form of administering the members of the vagina by fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	 The form of administering the vagina by fire. And its aperture is opened up to both hands; and its quantity in depth are moderate palm size; and there it lies on the side where it was placed on [the board], near the middle thereof, hole through which the probe goes in, according to the quantity for which it must be inserted with an instrument: so that the member may not pain from being above itself; also it is between its parts a sword transversed by wind or iron when it is put upon with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	 This is translated as follows: "And now it's ready for use in great size, greater than that we had learned before, and smaller by but little, according to the age and temperament of him who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	 "The size used for children is different from those for adults, as they are more delicate and less robust.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	 "When applying this tool on the skin with fire it should be done carefully and gently to avoid burns, either by using a candle for more delicate areas or by using a lamp made from soot.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	 "Then we apply it on the skin and keep our finger over the hole I mentioned until we have finished using it.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	 "After that, when you come across another one of these instruments
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	 "The size used for urine collection using water is different from that one and does not have a hole in it, so it cannot be applied to the skin directly.
Et haec est forma eius.	 "This is its shape.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	 "The size used for urine collection using water is larger than that one and allows collecting a lot of water making it better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	 "On the subject of drawing blood
Caput XCIX.	 "Chapter ninety-nine:
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	 "Bloodletting is not done on many people unless there are specific areas that can hold the tools, due to their delicacy.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	 "Or on an exposed part of the body like fingers or nose and so forth
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	 "The quality used for bloodletting is to make use of those present in the water and not in any corrupted ones.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	 "They are given rest for a day and night in sweet waters until they become dry and there is nothing left on them.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	 "After that the body is prepared with bloodletting and then rinsed
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	 Remove the member while it is still bleeding
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	 They are placed on top of him
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	 As a result they are inserted and fall away until the bleeding stops. And if not, then it is possible to make suction from there with an arrow, at that time being more ultimate in injury: and if not, then go back with vinegar to the place.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	 Remove when much water remains, until it starts to drip, and is expressed.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	 If the course of blood after the death of blood occurs for a long time and it has become still left over then take out the cold water, put it on top of him until the remainder is discharged.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If blood becomes excessive then take out a vessel or a jug and pour it over him with vinegar and similar things from vessels until the blood is discharged.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	 Or they may be placed on top of the place for treating ulcers by removing all kinds of lice or nits from them and take away until the wool is held together in that place because blood is discharged.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	 And if it is necessary to make a second incision into the body with vinegar then change these things when possible.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	 If the bloodletting is prohibited by suspension then remove from that place where there has been recent bleeding.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	 Or if it goes into a vessel or another thing with blood then come back until something is taken out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	 They are placed there when they sense something from the blood and immediately hold it.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	 When this is necessary to make them fall then pour over them something from alum, salt or pitch and they fall immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	 The second part has ended.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	 Third part of the book on surgery by Albucasis
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	 A speech about restoration and dislocations, and the care for twisted things, and others similar things.
Caput I.	 First book of the chapter on surgery by Albucasis.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	 This chapter is very necessary for the art of Medicine and it is restoration of fractures, dislocations at joints in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	 Brothers, since you are studying this chapter on medicine and surgery that you have not yet examined the ancient book or read it from beginning to end
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	 Because of this, a mode has been established for those of us here who are familiar with science in our own land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	 And I, having never known its benefits or proficiency in it, and not being accustomed to extracting its knowledge from others because of the length of their ancient books' chapters and the effort they put into studying them until I had acquired that science through study with them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	 Therefore having studied it for a long time, I have now come to understand its benefits
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	 And now I have explained to you everything from that book which contained my knowledge and the experiments beyond it after having taught it to you and given it out of length through reading, and after having shortened it by abbreviation and declination until finally showing it through shortening as well: so that in this way forms were made for me from instruments used in its administration with the addition of declination just like I did in two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	 In summary then and collections broken into pieces from these which have been delivered by necessity before we begin the memorialization of the fractured members and others if any one of them
Caput II.	 Chapter Two
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	 It is appropriate to say at the beginning of this chapter that our master teaches first and foremost about the artifice required for the station over their excellence: so that you who are eager may learn or teach this noble art, as well as others among you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	 I say then when any fracture or dislocation or twist occurred to him: it is then that the first thing needed is to apply a tourniquet and secure the injured part with something similar so as not to cause further harm if one does not prohibit anything, just like weakness from old age, or a heated or cold bath, in order to prevent this.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	 "In his hunger he is satisfied with cold foods and those of the flesh; and for him there should be prohibited wine, large meats, and any food that fills a person to excess.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	 "Until you are satisfied with the cold foods given to your partner and not excessive material effusion on the member; then restore weakness to its first course, according to his custom.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	 "When you restore the broken mouth, then it is necessary that the sick person should eat from nourishment to nourishment, much, big, coarse, which are sources of weakness; like those made with boiled wheat and rice, head, feet, hands, heart, liver, kidneys, lung, liver, fish recently cooked: and large wine and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	 "When the course of treatment is established, it is better than before.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	 "You know that broken bones when they are in the elderly who are in their first old age and decrepitude cannot be possible to continue as before due to the exhaustion of members; and they must remain and continue according to their nature forever, for the benefit of their members: and they will strengthen and continue what from them is at the end of lenity.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 "However nature has arranged something similar to gluttony into the mouth from all sides, which is bulkiness and can stretch it and hold it until the ones binding it are released; then there will be at the end of strength and firmness like before unless he does not prevent with his operations anything: for this reason, they must put nourishment on the sick person's food as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	 "You know that the species of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of members; for example, a fracture of the thigh is different from a fracture of the head of the bone: and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the arm: and similarly all the other bones are different as regards the tongue.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	 There are many kinds of fractures of bones and also within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	 Because it is curved fracture, they fell apart from the stars that happened to her
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	 And sometimes there is a fracture of his by length of the bones: and these fractures belong to the bone disease, that is, stars, and additional sources come from it, as they are in a cloak when cultured for writing
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	 And not coming: and there's a fracture with wounds and disruption to the head: and there is a fracture that cuts through it.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	 For all kinds of knowledge or tool to be used by him for the restoration of it, according to what is not remembered by him, being separate at their places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	 And from the one who knows about the fracture of bones is its winding and prominence: and appearance to him senses, and sound when compressed by your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	 Therefore when there is no more winding appearance in place, and not the sound near your touch with the lips and agitation, nor did he feel a great pain: then there is not there fracture, it's possible to be a curved wound or even broken bone.  And do not need that you hold him with his hand and compression constantly, but must throw it on top of it from medicines, whose memory was after the moment mentioned above in place: then it will be tightened with a fine cord
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 You know that when it is curved and divided into two pieces apart from the fact that there are stars in him, but all parts will be separated by his comparison: then you must begin to do this with your own time for its restoration before he falls on a cold hand.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	 If it happens that the cold hand will fall off him after some days then rest on his arm until he stops falling off
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	 After all, you can try gently and intelligently.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	 And remember that the restoration of him and his adjustment is easier than bones where there are stars
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	 "Therefore, draw it as you remember it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	 If the bone is broken in more than two places, then it's necessary to extend this member with both hands or feet if one hand can be used as a foot and vice versa; either using your own hand if the member is attached to it, or using two ropes or tying a knot with both hands.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	 And when you place the member on a level ground with your own natural shape, until the parts of the broken member are extended; then tie them together in every way possible and according to whichever method suits your location: and also according to your strength so that no pain or injury occurs from your operation, neither damage nor hurt. And when you apply force equally on both sides against each other with a partner, use more beautiful forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	 In that moment, stretch and pull it out of your own hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	 If therefore you see something different there, correct it according to the amount of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	 And with a very strong stretch and compression as many other strong people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	 Indeed, they make the cut very cold and use compression on a member of their own; as we have seen it from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	 Afterwards, tie and untie the member after the stretch; fix its parts in place with tightness and calm; secure it firmly so that no one can move on top of it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	 And fix it so that it doesn't move during your own hours of work and in the sleep you have taken; make sure to remove all your motions from its last strength
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	 So that the position of the member is not with a pain following it.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	 This is because when the member senses pain or damage from its positioning, then it's necessary to change its position to another one without that pain being felt.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	 And when you are with it so that its positioning is equal and straight; so that no twisting occurs when it's restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	 The quality of a fractured member is determined according to how it heals
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	 If a fractured bone differs in length or size, and shape as well
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	 Therefore, since they are similar to the arm and finger (forefinger), you should apply a soft, smooth cloth for healing
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	 However if it is large like the thigh or leg, then use a broad, rough cloth for healing
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	 Because the large ligament holds the bone tightly and connects it to all parts of the fracture with equal force, therefore the cut cannot penetrate
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	 After removing your bandage from it and placing the liniment upon it gently on top of the place where the fracture is, you should begin to apply pressure with a soft, smooth cloth over the entire area.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	 After removing the bandage from it and applying liniment gently on top of the place where the fracture is, you should start to apply pressure with both or four hands depending on how much effort can be made on the bone: while holding your hand tight along with the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	 Then proceed to apply pressure further up towards the upper area of the fracture and hold it as tightly as possible while releasing some of the tension you had previously applied.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	 Then continue applying pressure further up towards the upper area of the fracture while gently relaxing it slowly until you have released enough tension to cause the large bone part (arm or leg) to return to its normal state.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	 After this continue applying pressure on another hand and repeat it with a second hand above the area of the fracture.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	 Then proceed to apply pressure further down towards the lower area of the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	 And your operation shall be based on our first mention of the application of pressure at the higher area, and relaxation and gentle touch to it, as we mentioned earlier.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	 After this place an interval between the two pressures and either apply a bandage or cloth to it depending on how tortuous the fracture is (if there are any twists), or do not put anything on it if there aren't any twists.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	 "Then remove from above the same wound another.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	 "Next, apply an equal bandage to cover up the incision, and if there is no inflation from above, do not put on a cold compress.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	 "If there is an inflation above it, or if there was one earlier, then place over it the same bandage that caused the inflation, and continue to wrap it until the inflammation subsides, removing it every few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	 "Then tie up the incision as above.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	 "And the bandages above should be of different types and sizes, such as those made from linen, rope, or reeds that are wound around a pole, or strips, or branches with palm leaves, or rushes: and their size should match this form and shape exactly.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	 "However, it is necessary that the bandage placed above should be larger and more extended than any other bandage.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	 "Then tie up the other bandage as described earlier with another bandage of a different type or size.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	 "Finally tie the second bandage above with another bandage of different type or size, and it should be such that your bandage is placed on top of the fracture, which has been described as being higher; and how much more extended will your bandage become at the time when there is a fracture compared to an uninjured area: so in this case you have to make sure that your bandage becomes larger.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	 "And it is necessary for the middle file of bandages to be softer and more delicate than any other: they should be made from linen cloth.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	 "Since if the middle file is coarse like those put there by experienced surgeons from tightly bound threads, it's a major mistake because the bandage will fall off due to its quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	 "And delicate middle files should never be used together, since you won't achieve what was intended by using them with these.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	 "Do not make the distance between the two bandages less than one fingerbreadth.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	 "If a bandage is loosened or injured as it passes over the incision and down to healthy parts, then place something soft under them, like linen cloth or a dampened piece of clothing until nothing more slips off from there.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	 When there is a fracture accompanied by a wound and disruption of the skin occurs, I apply remedies to commemorate his memory according to this specific rule
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	 And you know that every fractured member should be treated with splints on the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	 Because when a member is large, you should not place splints on top of it unless five days have passed, or seven, or more, according to your safety guidelines from the cold wind and rain.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	 And this is how splints were used by old physicians who are placed over fractures or dislocations.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	 A common method of splinting is to use them over many days with various dressings and especially on the head, breasts, or legs because it does not cause heat or cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	 And it is so that you remove the moles from the flesh and apply a bandage around the ear, holding them with strings as mentioned above except for the mole itself, which should not be bound tightly to avoid damaging or irritating it.
Deinde utere eo.	 Then use this splinting method.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	 Another way of splinting is to treat fractures and dislocations as well as twists or bends.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	 Take aloe, and labdanum, and cedar, and mulberry; and put them all together in a mixture with water or with the juice of aloes (used for moistening); or apply them as bandages if there is heat from putting on too tight a bandage.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	 Then use this splinting method.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	 This is a good mixture to splint fractured bones or to support limbs many days in succession.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	 Another way of splinting is to treat fractures and twists as well.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	 Take mugwort, and mullein white (used to treat skin conditions), and aloes, and acacia; put them all together in a mixture with water or with the juice of aloes (used for moistening); or apply them as bandages if there is heat from putting on too tight a bandage.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	 The modus of separating bones from their places is as follows. And one must cause pain to them and cut open the flesh with a knife, so that they may be separated.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	 Scald the wool until it is loose and dissolved; then immerse it into vinegar solution (vinegar mixed with oil); and place this on the affected area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	 However, regarding the modus of separation by means of an implement, there is no virtue for restoration but only a benefit to those being soothed with warmth; and it gets rid of pain itself.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	 The modus for restoring a broken bone (which I assume means setting the bone back into place).
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	 Fold your fingers like this [demonstrates], and your other hand makes a loop around them; then take all of it, and make the separation implement (plaster) out from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	 The modus for reducing a fracture is as follows. When you have finished the treatment and are left with the remaining parts to be soothed (the other bones), do this.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	 The recipe for the treatment of high fevers is as follows. Take a mixture of radish tops, chamomile, and the flowers of hawthorn; and add ground herbs to it all in one part. Then mix them with wine if the member being treated isn't heated up (i.e., not scalded).
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	 If the member is already hot when this treatment is to be given, then mix it with warm water or wine for cooling (but if scalded by wine don't use it).
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	 The modus for a stronger separation procedure is as follows when the pain is severe due to the soothing of a member's part.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	 The recipe for treating high fevers is as follows. Take a mixture of radish tops, linseed, walnut, millet, and sweet cicely; add all these to one part, then mix them with salt water or sugar water (wine if available)
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	 Treat it according to the member's temperature and calm his heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	 Hippocrates stated in his book that one should place a plaster over the broken member if it is necessary for restoration of its parts, but only from the horn of a goat and oil; he also mentioned to maintain an equilibrium between coarseness and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 Galen advised that when a member is fractured for repair of its part, which contains heat extraction, such as myrrh, aloes and olibanum; similar things from them which we have taken
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	 A method for application in plaster to heal wounds and alleviate pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	 Make of mugwort and chickweed, or the hair of men's incisors, or the beard hairs, or salt parts equal; they will be mixed together, and sifted, then made into a plaster.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	 The quantity according to what is necessary for the bandage to hold, then it will be soaked, so that you consider at that time if there was no accident of weakness or pain or itching not to be opened with its mouth in its place; thus it does not resolve itself within days many.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	 If it happened to him with the itchiness of a man or pain and swelling; then quickly soak that plaster immediately, and apply it at the same time: take linen cloth or sponge soaked in warm water, put it over where the itching is or the pain arises; until the itching stops and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	 Then allow one hour for the member to rest quietly.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	 Then put on top of that member a hot compress soaked with vinegar and oil, or almond oil; bind it on at night for one hour until it is secure from the heat by the next day's morning, then the swelling in the member will stop, and its pain will be removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat this to a thin bandage and the plaster, and do not tie it with your constriction first, and gently as you go along with it until it is cured.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	 If you see that the plaster and bandage are loose or broken from accidents and injuries which have already occurred, then repeat this as before, equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	 If none of those things which we mentioned has happened to the member in these days or weeks, then do not apply it again until after three days, four days, five days, seven days; at your discretion
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	 When an object remains a hundred days unbroken and has the appearance of being dissolved by your solution (in other words, you are not able to dissolve it completely), then until that time when the fracture happens or the coagulated flesh is above the fracture, add more than before in binding together: also at this point put on the addition of the loosening food for the patient.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	 If you are already aware that a fracture has occurred and if it is necessary to extend the treatment further than before, then know that nourishment must be withheld from him (the patient).
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	 Therefore dissolve it with hot water into all kinds of vessels that are available to you and let this continue for three days; also increase the binding together more than before.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	 With this procedure, the treatment is directed towards restoring or healing the member.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	 That which restorers of a broken member do with another vessel when the restoration is not accomplished first, according to what needs to be done and according to the tortuousness; this is an error from their procedure and great fear exists: if it was rectus they say that those men in their books did perform operations on him.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	 And I (Albucasis) do not follow the request of any of them for doing that to him at all times, and it is correct as long as he does not want this.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	 Of a fracture or injury on the head
Caput III.	 The third head.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	 There are various species of fractures and many shapes of them; their causes also are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	 From the fracture is what happens from a blow with a stroke, and this blows all of it until it reaches the siphon that is below the bone as an axe cuts through wood; for this reason, this species of fractures is called Axialis.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	 Or a blow is struck by the very bone of him and hits his face, but does not penetrate into the very end of him; this species of fractures is called Kalaan, which means an absolute severance.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	 The two arteries may be either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	 If it is fractured, whether there was a contraction (contritio), or an abrasion (attritio). And the cause of this was either a blow with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or something similar
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	 And this fracture is also when it pierces through and meets the flesh of the body (panniculus), so that a blow on the face would be like one hitting bone with a stone, or falling upon bones.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	 And this fracture is when it passes secretly into the bone through a very thin channel (capillus), so that an injury to the nail would be like one hitting bone with a stone, or falling upon bones.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	 And from these is the fracture that occurs by chance or by impact on a stone, and are similar to those who enter the layer of bone into its inner part, so that there comes a hollowing out: like what happens when hot air strikes against them (aeris) and hits their parts inward.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	 And this occurs very often on the hands of people's bones, like children's heads.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	 There are separate species of fractures from those mentioned above for all these days and times.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	 And we know all the species of fractures from the examination of them and their examination with hands, and also the destruction of corrupted tendons that are above them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	 The species called "Capillaris" is recognized through this one, in that it is grasped over the eye and pulled out by wax with a stroke of the pen; for thus the black fracture appears.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	 In the healing of a fracture, it is first necessary to consider the accidents of an individual; if you see from accidents what signifies a clear manifestation over fear, such as in cholerae and its extension and damage, and excision with words, and syncope, fever, and exiting the eyes, and reddening them. And like these are caused by many accidents, proximity does not heal well: and if you do not see accidents, but you have faith in salvation, then begin the healing of it.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	 "If a bone is broken to you and it hurts first of all, then this is the time to study how to heal bones on the fourth day following.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	 "And if the tooth is broken on that day as well, then this should be studied how to remove it before the seventh day, before what occurs beneath the bone from the socket and any accidents that occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	 "If a bone is broken to the socket and it is causing discomfort as well, then this should be studied how you hit that portion of it which was separated and torn off, according to what happened to you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	 "And it is so that you remove the head from what was broken to you, and cut above the bone according to any way possible for you, and according to how bad it looks over the sick one.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	 "If an accident occurs at the fracture of a bone by blood flowing or a hot stroke, then you should bind it with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	 "And it is so that you bind the place with burned fat and oil until the stroke settles down, and you are safe from blood flowing.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	 "Then begin to study on the healing of bones and their removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	 "This will be according to one of two ways.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	 "One way is so that you cut the bone with a sharp and narrow knife; and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	 "The other method is to administer another incision above those, and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	 "Then you administer the second incision still more than according to that one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	 "The second way is so that there is a different number of incisors than yours, some of which are wider and others smaller; and the last ones being at their extremity, they hurt and are used in cutting with iron, or burned; and you use it easily to strike over the incision so as not to cut off your head, and to cause its pain.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	 If the nose is strong, you must then perform an incision in its vicinity before applying Incisoria, while using the blades that are called Terebra and not penetrating deep: furthermore they do not call them so because the same does not pass through the term of the flesh to what follows immediately after this. Because, since the Terebro is round about it which is below his head sharp like a circle and prevents submersion by surrounding completely with the blades
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	 And it will be given to you that you take from these many Terebras of various sizes until the present moment when all the Terebras are around your neck: whose sharp extremity has a certain quantity in length and width, according to the quantity of the blade of his head
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	 These are the shapes of three species of Terebras or Trepans
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	 The quality of piercing the flesh through and through is as follows: put the Terebra on your nose and keep it there with your fingers until you know that the nose has been pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	 Afterwards change the Terebra to another place and put it between every hole in a row or around it.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	 Afterwards make an incision with Incisoria between every hole in a row or around it as subtly as you can above the same using its edge, just like we said until you remove the nose or with your hand or by means of some other instrument which is used to that effect: so carefully and with subtlety.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	 And you must be very careful not to touch the Terebra or Incisoria at all.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	 Once you have pierced the nose and it is separated from the shaft if there was continuity with that, then remove him quickly so that he does not remain attached to bone with some other instrument similar to Incisoria
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	 Nevertheless, it is necessary that they be thin and subtle more than the others Incisoria
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	 If something needs to be removed from bones using a saw, then take it with ease, accompanied by that which is in your instruments
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	 Then apply the wound care after removing as directed
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	 Another method of treatment is easier than that for wounds, because it was said by Galen and praised greatly with great praise: and this is his word.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	 It is not necessary for you at first to remove the portion of bone from that place where it was more broken and visible: until when you have removed that part and placed under it the extremity of this arrow-shaped cutting tool whose form is like that one.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	 And the flat part does not cut anything at all: and the sharp part of it is drawn by both sides to its length like a picture: so that the flat part should strike towards an end, the sharp face of it hitting on bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	 Then strike over the arrow with one edge gently until you have cut it all with ease, just as before: and you are sure from the bone not to hit where the fall was, which delayed at last.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	 If the physicians were not more stupid and ignorant than they are, then something would remain attached to the bone from the shoulder in some places, it would come away with ease accompanied by that of the flat part of the arrow-shaped cutting tool whose form is like that one, and it would let him go free with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	 It will be released from it without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	 If the fracture of the bone does not extend to the shoulder blade, and what is removed from the bone is the face of it, and remain in this place sharpness and subtletiness: then you should try to remove that sharpness, and get rid of those subtleties with the help of the ones prepared for many quantities by number. So that you can administer them on every part more conveniently yours, and better theirs according to what was done to you, and it is broken bone face, whose figure is like that one.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	 "Firstly you must administer your veins through which arteries of greater size.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	 "After that, use a smaller vessel afterwards to administer it.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	 "Do not cease the administration of this medicine until you return to administer it through a smaller vessel and use a more narrow one.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	 "From the remaining small veins and capillaries you must break a smaller vessel to administer this medicine in order for it to return from its incision.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	 "And there is that which we did not conceal above all things, of which here in this art whatever study or knowledge was possible and stood over what we have written and demonstrated the great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	 "If the scrotal vessel is detected and retained when you open your mouth, then it must be taken up by its lining as much as possible to the oil rose and placed over a urethral opening.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	 "Then take up another doubled or tripled lining and immerse it in wine and rose oil to place it over the first one and do this as easily as possible so that you may not be embarrassed.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	 "Then administer the broader ligature over it and do not bind it except to what extent is held by a small vein; then loosen it with this care one or two days later until you are six times secure from another person.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	 "Then let it go loose and administer after that medicines with which there is excess of dryness as much as the roots of lilies, flour of herbs, and urine of thurys, and parsley, and similar things: so that you may make a poultice from these less dried-out medicines which will be applied over the vessel in the same way as you would apply them if they were not dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	 "And universally administer all medicines of which it is necessary to withdraw and do not bite upon it.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	 "And according to your virtue so that the vessel is clear during your care and not has any foul ointments or foulness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	 "Do not remove the knife from any part of his body unless it is on the skull; because when the knife enters through the brain's sheath and touches the brain itself, it corrupts it, putsrefies it, and causes him to fall down when great malice intervenes at that point. And if it happens in the neck, while its head is being held out of its sheath with negligence towards its care, then his flesh turns black on the surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	 Therefore, if accidents to an invalid occur as we have said (i.e., injuries to an invalid that are life-threatening), you know, since it is extremely harmful close by.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	 If blackness does not occur unless some medicine is placed upon him and has the power of that medicine to make it dark, then you should take one portion from oil and three portions from sesame seed paste and bind them with threads on his body.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	 Then place him upon the sheath; after this, care for him as much as you can according to the procedures which I have mentioned.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	 "When restoration fails.
Caput IIII.	 The second part of the head (i.e., the neck).
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	 Know that the nose does not break through unless two of its upper parts are both broken at once or one of them; moreover because it has two bones: namely, the lower part is cartilaginous and cannot be broken, nor can he fall except from injury, dislocation, and contusion.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	 If one of the two upper parts breaks through, then you should put your thumb in the nostril to push it out with your index finger and pull its fracture back towards yourself; and press downwards on both sides as much as possible until the nose is restored to its natural shape: and let this be done gently by art.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	 And also, that you do not cause harm from your own operation on him.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	 If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach that finger, then you should stretch your hand to its utmost limit, where there is some fat.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	 If the fracture is in both parts at once, do something like that; and proceed with his restoration on the first day of the fracture if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	 And if not then on the 7th day after, or on the 10th day at calm and friendly places.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	 Afterward, if the bandage becomes loose or torn at all points except for one, you should insert two bandages; and let their width be such as to fill up the opening of the vein.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	 Some ancient restorers said that the bandages should often be changed with butter; and daily change would occur.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	 I am afraid this is beyond my capacity to understand, but it seems necessary that the bandage be filled with white egg yolk beaten with pulse powder.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	 After removing the bandage, let the mouth be opened up and the cartilage softened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	 And sometimes a feather from the wing of an ostrich is inserted into the vein on Nasum's arm; when it has been stretched gently over this band without any effort: and so that if the injury to Nasi extends upward, then she does not prevent the weak one being inspired.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	 No, these are not necessary things.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	 If you wish to do this, then do this; if you wish to do that, then let the bandage be done.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	 If Naso is operated upon by a cold vein, he should bandage the nose with crushed laurel leaves or crushed saffron; or if cooked in olive oil, or mixed with a certain amount of dried fig powder.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	 If the vein is not cold however, then it is necessary that you put a bandage on him with flour and egg yolk beaten together; or if he has already been given an ointment of flour and pulse powder mixed with white egg yolk.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	 Afterward let it be placed gently on top of him without any others; or else you should place a bandage on his arm separately.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	 If Naso's bones are broken and torn in several pieces, then it is necessary that you saw through them; or else remove him with any instruments which fit for this purpose.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	 Afterward you should saw through it; and look after him as he is placed in the bandage with a suitable substance to hold him firmly together, or with an ointment if that's necessary.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	 When a man sustains an arrow wound in his neck, then it is necessary to treat him with the right remedies and administer a poultice of lead until he recovers.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	 Restoration of lower mandible when broken
Caput V.	 Skull V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	 When the lower mandible is broken and the fracture does not involve any wound, then only a simple break occurs; however, if the bone breaks through the mouth (fractura deforis tantum), or if it splits in two (frangitur in duo), there will be some damage to the interior of the mouth.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	 Therefore, if the break occurs in the right side of the mandible (si est fractura eius in parte dextra), then you should insert your left index finger into his mouth to provide support: similarly, if it is on the left side, you should use your right hand and push with both hands to quickly bring the bone out from within, using one hand for support at the interior part of the face, while using your other hand to hold back against the exterior.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	 If the mandible has already broken into two parts (si fractura mandibulae iam separatata est in duo), then it is necessary to administer an extrusion with both hands, following proper procedure until there is equality between them.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	 If an accident occurs to the teeth or disruption has already occurred (si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio), then secure them with whatever you have for preventing loss of the tooth: wire from gold or silver, a file, or a needle.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	 Then place over the broken jaw (deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum)
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	 Then place over it a double band (deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum), and over the broken head an equally large star that has been made crooked; or you may use a skin patch of equal size to cover up any remaining wound on the face, running lengthwise down the length of the mandible.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	 Then bind it over with the bandage that you prepared for yourself (deinde liga ipsum desuper), apply it evenly and securely until no further damage occurs; and provide him with something soft to lie on, so he can be at rest in peace and quiet: and bring him a gentle drink of food.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	 If you suspect that something has changed regarding a figure of any kind, then proceed and remove it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	 Then correct what has been altered in it and scrape out the mold with a scraper made of pumice stone or ashes mixed with lime or flour, depending on whether you use pumice stone or flour paste.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	 Once it has been attached to the figure in this manner and its disposition is not changed, you may remove it; however, if anything should change regarding the disposition of his limbs, then set him free (i.e., let him go).
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	 It often happens that a fracture is held in place by three supports for seven days.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	 If an abscess becomes hot while we are administering the remedy that I mentioned earlier (i.e., if a complication occurs during administration of the remedy), then remove that abscess.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	 And if there is a fracture along with a wound, consider it carefully.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	 Now if the bone has already separated from the flesh (i.e., if there is no longer any connection between the two), either by force or by cunning, then proceed carefully to this procedure so that you may remove what came out with them during the removal of their instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 If the opening in the wound is narrow, then widen it by means of a phlebotomist according to your needs.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	 After removing the abscess and nothing comes out of them anymore, then you must widen it if necessary; otherwise, attach a scraper that conforms to this on top of him and scrape off what is coming from there until he is freed (i.e., let go).
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	 Of the restoration of the phallus: when it is broken
Caput VI.	 Chapter six
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	 Indeed a lot of phalli can be broken from the front part to the side of the arm and the fracture occurs according to one of three modes.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	 Alternatively it can be broken apart from both sides without complications arising; and restoration is easier for him (i.e., the phallus).
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	 Or so that complications arise with bone injury; and this makes the restoration more difficult.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	 As a fracture accompanied by a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	 If there is no wound accompanying a fracture, then the surgeon should have two assistants present; one assistant to follow the fractured limb and another to stretch the other side of the body upwards.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	 Afterwards, straighten your fingers as much as possible until he forms his hand according to what is appropriate; but there should be no excessive elevation or fall of the hand itself.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	 If your fingers extend more through the stretching process, then you should put a small sponge or thread on it so that its size matches what is necessary for your needs; and stretch out your arm as well as possible to get the elbow free from around the hand.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	 If you are unable to pull the elbow out of its socket; instead, because it has gone deep into place, then put an assistant above his head so that he can be lifted up from beneath him onto the ground below: and have this assistant put a medium-sized piece of cloth under the elbow itself.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	 If you feel that he is falling out from around it; then in this case, put an assistant next to him and pull him gently away quickly.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	 If the fracture is on a bone, then in this case take one of the assistants who has prepared it and put it under his arm so that he can be freed from around it; but if you are using wood or iron as an instrument for this, you should prepare another assistant to hold onto him.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And here is the form of the operation.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	 If he has no concavity, let a small sponge be put in his ear to help with this.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	 And the length of it should match what your fingers are extended towards from their size and reach.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	 The length of his arm as well, but also according to how much you can manage during the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	 And he has two arms just like yours; one is wide and the other is narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	 If you disrupted when extricating the sutures of a wound and it became wide open, then secure it with a ligature from an apostle's hand; then close both lips together over the suture
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	 If it is wide open, or you have used too much force to remove the sutures; then secure it with a ligature from an apostle's hand; and close both lips together over the suture
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	 If you used too much force against an apostle's ligature; then insert a linen cloth soaked in oil and vinegar into the wound, together with honey and wine, and place it on top of that.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	 The suture was undone because there was no wound and no incision; it is as if you placed a plaster made from flour mixed with egg whites over the mouth that had been smeared with it.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	 Then place a linen cloth soaked in vinegar on top of that.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	 After that, smear the ball under his titillation if he becomes tired out.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	 After that, take a date palm leaf which the Saracens use; it is long and thin like a rope. And its breadth on one side or all around will be enough to close his mouth.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	 After that, place two layers of linen cloth over the plaster and the titillation.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	 After that, take a star from a small table; its breadth is similar to three fingers' lengths.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	 After that, put it into the linen cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	 After that, place the star where it fell upon a fracture and location.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	 After that, place the star over the fracture just as you put it; and put it on top of his head, and under one titillation for him to heal and under another for him to be healed from: And reduce her above all parts, so that you know how to hold the suture tight when holding onto a fractured bone tightly. It is this way which cannot be hidden from you, and in total it will not go away from over his mouth unless he removes it
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	 And for that reason, you should strive to have him always during the day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	 "Therefore soften the ligament and look for the star that has slipped away; then correct it by pulling the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	 Then lie the patient on his back and put a feather beneath him while he is asleep; then blow into the ear of the same person during sleep as if you were helping them breathe by placing your hand over their mouth, until they die.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	 Therefore a broken bone will heal through elevation and manipulation of the arm.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	 Bend his arm at the elbow and do not loosen it unless there is a fall or accident from scratching or falling on an object for twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	 Then resume the plaster if you see that face to it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	 And add to it when it is contracted and remove it when restored; then it will heal and coagulate.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	 A broken bone is bound up gently and firmly within twenty days, sometimes for shorter periods among some people.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	 The healing of the fracture
Caput VII.	 Chapter Seven
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	 A spatula is often broken at its base and does not break away from the part it is attached to; unless one of its edges breaks.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	 When therefore it is broken from that location and it is broken through the middle of it, then one does not know about this until they touch; at which point they remove what was a figure of the fracture.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	 Reduce that to an inherent form in any way that you are capable of doing it.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	 Then lay the patient above a bed with feathers and pillows; then cover him up with a linen sheet two times over.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	 Then lay upon them a feather spread wide from the small table as large or larger than it is.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	 If there has been excess in the concavity of some spatulae; then equalize that concavity with the feather gently until the star descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	 Then firmly fasten upon him above with long and decent constriction and the firmness of feathers until he is moved from his place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	 On every day
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 For whatever reason the ligament softens, tie it up and align the star so that when pulled loose from its place, there is relief for the patient to his proper health.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	 And a spatula should be restored every 10 days or every day
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	 When that number is completed, then the tie securely.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	 This same thing happens when the bones are not connected and their solution cannot be made.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	 If the bone is broken, or if it has been pulled to pieces, then hold its upper end up, lift it out of place.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	 And do what we said when the neck bone is broken because of a cold and wet environment if it comes into contact with something
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	 On the treatment of a broken shoulder.
Caput VIII.	 The eighth head.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	 When it is broken on its middle part and rarely happens to that one.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	 His extremities are the least frequently broken from accidents occurring there.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	 When the middle part is broken and it falls towards the lower end with pain and difficulty to raise, there may be a loss of blood, there's a weakness in the bone declared when fractured, and not hidden from those watching over him; and its treatment is that he lies on his back until lifted up by the spatula.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	 Then raise his upper arms and both sides with hands, and gently towards alignment as much as possible until it is restored to its original shape according to the way it can happen and agreed upon, when that happens and it has been done then restore to what should be the figure of the bone, according to how necessary it is.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	 Then put a bandage above him and a spatula on top of it, and put the star from the small table or the salt shaker over his head as well, and similarly to both sides after you have wrapped her up, so that she may be bound with care.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	 Then gently bind her to the broken part so that it may not be pulled loose and hold the binding according to its shape towards the back a little bit and tie it firmly.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	 In every hour when the ligature is becoming soft and loose, gently tighten it; if a need arises to remove or cure whatever has happened there through injury, corrosion, pain, or loss: then proceed immediately, tie off the ligature again and cleanse and treat the affected part with the appropriate care.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	 After you've tied it off, if you wish to examine its appearance more closely: then wrap your fingers around it and examine the ligature again.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	 In the event of a break in costae.
Caput IX.	 The ninth head.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	 When the costae break and are not accompanied by more serious injuries elsewhere on the body or from its extremities to the front: then you should examine their connection with the back.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	 Nor is this breakage caused by a weakening of cartilage;
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	 You should not miss the opportunity to examine them with your fingers during an inspection, as this may reveal any connection or weakness in their support system.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	 And the restoration of such costae can be done so that you gently correct their break and adjust them as best fits to restore their shape in accordance with what is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	 After you've corrected it: if there are still any signs of tension or looseness around the wound and ligature after all this work has been done; then gently wrap your fingers around them again to tie off that part as well.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	 If the costae break inwards, causing pain to the wound and to the surrounding tissue as if struck by a fuller's spindle or a point of needle; then you should examine with great care for any injury to the hand that has been weakened, especially because this will cause discomfort to the injured part, and many other injuries as well: wounds, bruises, multiple bleeding points. And these are very difficult to treat.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	 And they have also used remedies such as those who say to put food into the hand of an inflamed and swollen intestine so that it will be calmed down by this application: or perhaps a remedy where you apply pressure on one side of the wound to prevent any breaking outwards.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	 We are afraid that we should not cause harm or looseness in order to perform a cold application if it does not help at all.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	 If an injury has already occurred, then apply this remedy immediately
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	 Some of them said that it should be placed on the injured part and applied with force, then the reasoning is similar to this one.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	 However, caution must be taken because too much pressure may cause paralysis due to weakening of the affected part.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	 Some of them said that the injured part should be treated with wool that has been soaked in warm oil and then placed between the ribs until it swells up; so that a knot may be tied at an equal length when pulled out, according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	 After this the injured part was cured by treatment with food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	 If the injured part swells too much and does not tolerate food or drink, or it emits a stream of fluid from the wound accompanied by pain, and we fear for the patient; then let us cut away the swollen part and remove any broken fragments that may remain attached to the ribs.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	 After this we place on it an instrument for holding its shape which remembrance follows: and strike it with ease both in front and behind.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	 After this we gather two lips of the mouth if a big stitch has been made; and we treat it with plasters until it is cured.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	 If an accidental injury has occurred to the lips with cold oil and is being treated; let a warm wool be soaked in oil and placed on it; then treat the injured part as if it were from the finger, until it is cured because of its contact with the cold.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	 In addition a warm wool soaked in oil should be placed on top of the affected part when it has been sleeping to speed up its cure.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	 Of the treatment for fractures of the spine and collar bones.
Caput X.	 Head, X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	 The collar bones sometimes break and rarely sustain injuries; similarly the vertebrae of the back also do so.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	 When this occurs to someone else, inquire if he is able to recover or not; then be advised.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	 As soon as the hands are soft and relaxed, and motionless, and dead; nor can they move them or stretch out, when you press on them with your fingers, or try to pull them apart, for this is not possible: and if you should grasp them together by means of your fingers, and squeeze upon them with force, it will not be felt or cause any pain in the hands themselves; but then you may know that such things cannot be cured, and death has come to many men.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	 If the hands should move them and there is felt a squeezing with your fingers or pain, then you may know that such things cannot be cured, for the hand has become weak from illness.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If the hands become like those of a man who is paralysed or lame (swayed and disordered), you will know that they cannot be cured, for the hand has become weak from illness; then consider his feet to see if he can move them at all, when placed upon him - whether it is movement with force, or without force. And if he moves upwards towards his back, in such a way as to be moved downwards by weight and not able to do so, you will know that this also cannot be cured: for death has come to many men.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	 Therefore, no more work is done on curing him.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	 If nothing falls from that upon him, it's lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	 And the curing that fell upon him from that is such as you would apply a soothing ointment and place over his paralyzed limb some warm, fragrant oil or with a touch of sweet food.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	 Place him over that thing on many occasions in a day until when the cold application is finished; then place something else upon it with plasters and moistening, and tightening around to him by means of a rope or bandage: and anoint gently so that he may be made quiet and tranquil.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	 Do not let him stay over the part from which pain was caused until it is cured.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	 If something should fall from the diseased hand or limb that has already been separated from him, then you must take it off and give it to someone else.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	 After making a large incision in two layers of skin
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then apply the incision with a knife to remove the flesh
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	 The remaining bones are removed after the incision by cutting them out with a knife, and then you should insert your left hand's finger into his anus, while simultaneously fracturing his right arm at whatever point may be possible and breaking it along its length, and then finally break the second one as well.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	 After this is done, apply pressure to stop the bleeding while simultaneously cleaning with what precedes it in order to prevent further loss of blood.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	 In the restoration of Anchae
Caput XI.	 The 11th head
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	 Bones of Anchae break easily
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	 If the bones break, then a fracture is not made unless there are comminutions at their extremities; and they are severed along their length, and decline towards the interior; and there occurs pain by force which is inflicted on that which breaks; and it grows dim where it is fractured.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	 And the restoration to him is as follows: You extend your hand over him until the fracture has healed just like he himself was doing.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	 If the fracture is only at his extremities then you should make it equal to that which was taught to you from an agreement with him until the natural figure of his own body comes back into place.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	 If the fracture is along his length or has already declined towards its interior; then you should place a soft object above him until the restoration of that fracture occurs with precision.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	 When you make it equal then you place above him a soft object; next to that you place the star from wood or hide and bind with a strong knot so that the motion of the fracture is prevented by the star and the movement of the constellation is not hindered.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	 And you make the equality with him in order to fix it; and you bind the soft object tightly so that he lies on his back or flat chested body.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	 "If the cold object touches him (the patient), then immediately cease applying it and begin his treatment in restoring its position as soon as possible.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	 "If a satchel accidentally touched his bones or came off by itself, remove it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	 "On the restoration of broken leg bone with Adiutorium.
Caput XII.	 "Head 12th.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	 The Adiutorium is that which lies between the elbow and head of Spatulae.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	 "If it breaks then his restoration will be in one of two ways.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	 The first way is to apply a flat middle sized plank following this shape.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	 "And the two ligaments at both ends are tied.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	 Then the suspension is removed from its place and it rests on the bed.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	 After that he places his broken arm above the plank and when it reaches its end, then hooks into a splint attached to its middle.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	 "Then he suspends him something heavy from above so that he may be stretched downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	 After that the physician simultaneously deals with both broken limbs until the fractures are healed in accordance with what is necessary.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	 Another way is for him to rest on his own bed and tie the broken arm to its head with a ligament.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	 And he prepares two assistants to support the one above the break with his hands and the other below him so that each of them stretches towards their own side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	 If it is desired to have a stronger stretch then he ties the broken limb under with a ligament and above with another one following this shape.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	 If the fracture is close to the elbow then it is necessary that a ligament be placed under the elbow and one below the break.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	 And similarly if a fracture is close to it, then there must be placed over that point a ligature and above the bone itself
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	 After that, when the fracture is equal to it without difficulty or labor, only then will the fracture be in line with what needs to happen and a good application should occur. Then bind her if not she will escape unharmed.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	 If by chance it escaped from the cold ligature, then release the restraint until seven days have passed
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	 And place on top of it a thin thread soaked in vinegar and oil and make it into a ball with honey, until the ligature has quieted down; then bind her like this: and there is the mode by which you can bind her so that she may be placed over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	 After that, place a new cloth on top of the ball.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	 Afterwards, hold your arm up and put your open hand over your own shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	 And place the cloth and bind it over your arm so that it will be held in a stable position; if this doesn't hold you from something falling on it or anything else escaping out of the fractured bone, then nothing will escape above or below you.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	 If something else escapes up from the fractured bone above you after that, use a star like this; and it is so that you bind her over the fracture with one which is smaller and stronger than others.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	 And place between all of them a width equal to your finger; the length of the stars should be according to the fracture with an additional three fingers on every part.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	 After that, bind the ligature as I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	 And so it should be that your ligation is placed over the place where the stricter fracture occurs.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	 And as the length of the fracture increases, then the ligature will decrease in length.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	 If you have everything ready and the ligation is placed as I described it at that time when you will restore the member quickly, then do this: if by chance she escapes from her cold ligature, then release the restraint and let her go until seven days have passed.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	 "In considering a ligature for three days, ensure that it does not cause itching or swelling at the site where it is applied, nor shall it be removed from the body by force, due to the constriction of fluids.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	 Therefore, let this be done as we have said so.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	 "If it is too close to the skin, then do not let anything come from it; for three days at most, unless otherwise specified.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	 "The nurse should lie down on his back and hold his hand above his belly; and place under the support there fill a full sack of equal weight.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	 "And consider at every hour of the night or day that it does not remove or soften the fractured member, nor ease the ligature.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	 "Therefore, do this with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	 "Place food for the nurse according to our order so that his mouth is first fed and does not start choking; then he must eat as much as possible.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	 "Therefore it is customary for the nurse to bind his hands and feet with ligatures for forty days; then he must be given water so that he may drink, and a bath will be provided for him, and medicated with oils that are suitable.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	 "If a fracture has occurred in the body, bind it tightly; then remove the ligatures and fasten them until fifty days have passed, or two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	 "Of the restoration of the arm's broken bone.
Caput XIII.	 "Chapter 13: Restoration of Fractured Bones.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	 "The arm is composed of two bones called the forefinger and thumb.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	 "One bone of it is small; that one follows the hand.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	 "The other bone is large and is placed below a smaller part from below.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	 "Therefore the larger bone may be broken along with it by the small one, or the small one alone; and sometimes both are broken together.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	 "Therefore, when the larger bone is broken by the smaller one at its top, then the restoration and healing of it are easy.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	 When the lower eyelid is broken, it's a bad injury and healing for it is difficult
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	 When both upper eyelids are broken simultaneously, that causes great damage.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	 If only the upper eyelid is broken, then it should be treated by a physician as soon as possible so that he can apply a patch to cover up the defect and make things equal.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	 If the upper eyelid is very broken (i.e., badly injured), then it should be treated by a physician as soon as possible so that he can apply a stronger patch to cover up the defect.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	 It is necessary for him to have someone else apply a mask over his face during treatment and to stretch it as much as possible above the eyebrows.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	 The hand should be placed on the upper eyelid and all other fingers of both hands except for one that is broken or disabled should point downward to protect his face from injury while he lies flat down.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	 After applying the patch, stretch the arm above him using a bandage if necessary.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	 And another person extends it from the other side in the same way.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	 After applying both patches and stretching them as far as possible, the physician should make things equal to him by reducing the difference between his two eyes according to what he can do.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	 If both upper eyelids are broken simultaneously, then you should reduce each of them separately where they were broken with your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	 If you see a defect separately from it and mark it with ink so that it is not lost to you; then find something above him similar to what we described for the patches on both eyes, and apply it as far as possible over his face according to how much was done in the ones that were applied.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	 If a defect is caused by injury and I have already provided a separate bandage for it separately; then take care of him from that point on.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	 If the bandage on your face turns cold in the beginning of your treatment and you need a warm one; then use a warm, white patch with some oil or rose water mixed into it to keep his eyes moist, but don't let it drip off him as he sits there, until after applying both patches everything is equal. Then remove the warm bandage and apply another fresh one made from flour and egg whites that you can mix together in a similar way for each patch separately.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	 "In place of stars, put another one that is placed above the cut in a manner wider than it and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	 "You know that the number of stars in the arm is six depending on their arrangement; either there should be one fracture in one pair of scissors or two fractures in two pairs of scissors.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	 "And place your own stricter over the fracture of strength more and stronger than it, as well as some amount with a stricter above the fracture or below; either place the stricter milder over his own fracture instead, remembering that this was mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	 "And there are those wrapping around a fracture, with loose ones and wet; they should not be hard or sharp.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	 "And it is the thread that is stretched from linen itself, in between subtle and coarse like we mentioned.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	 "And consider the member and ligament after a day.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	 "If you want to apply something whose rectification is necessary, as itching that strikes a member; then there should be such as the member becomes heated with water until the itch stops and the member is not twisted, in order for him to stop, after that stricter.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	 "If the stricter has already been made milder and removed its mouth as well as similar ones; then rectify that thing with your own strength and consider it again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	 "If food is prohibited from being given to the member due to excess in stricter, then there should be such that it becomes milder instead and you remove him for a certain number of days until he comes back; after that you should stretch it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	 "If on the other hand none of those things listed struck you with weakness, then there is no need to do it unless after one day or around them.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	 "Then your hands should be held weakly against his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	 "And the neck of him is equal and he should protect himself with his strength from movements that are agitated.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	 "And make him sleep on top of his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	 "It is known that this fracture will be restored within 30 days or 29 days; and possibly it will take more than one month.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	 It depends on the dispositions of the complexion and virtues.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	 On how to restore a fracture with the hand
Caput XIIII.	 The twelfth book.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	 It is known that the fingers of the hand are rarely injured by a fracture of the thumb.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	 And it did not happen to him unless there was excessive atrophy beforehand.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	 When the plants are fractured due to their own structure, it is necessary that he lie down flat; and his body should be placed symmetrically about him as though lying on his side.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	 Then place one of his hands upon her extended arm.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	 Then he extends the broken bones and arranges them symmetrically; until they are held together by a good jointing.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	 When it is necessary to lay the plaster and bandage on him, unless there has been severe cold injury.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	 Then place a star above according to its quantity; you have now covered it with linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	 If the plants are fractured on all sides except below, then make a ball of linen cloth; and place the weakened one upon it in such a way that he holds onto it with his fractured plant. Then tie him up with long cloth after this manner.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	 And the star should be of lead; so that it is rubbed against his body until he is covered with a plant's skin; and tie her up as necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	 If the plants are fractured on all sides except below, then place a star above; and another one of them from below upon the plant; have his hand open straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	 Then tie it up as before with the hand, so that he extends between the fingers by a cord.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	 If one of his fingers is fractured, then it should be placed as necessary to the side.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	 "After the application of a plant, if you are in love with it, apply to it an appropriate star, and then bind the wound with sinew so that it does not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	 "If the fracture is in any other digit except for the middle one, then bind it just as you would with the thumb and forefinger or ear lobe; at that point it will heal well, and if done correctly, all of them are bound together [in a similar manner] and it works better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	 "Or you can apply the star to the top with sinew as I mentioned for the thumb; this will also heal well if done correctly.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	 "And consider the restoration of yours and after its placement be careful with your hands in a gentle manner; hold it tightly when something happens to it from that moment on according to how its story is told.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	 "On the restoration of the fracture of the tibia.
Caput XV.	 "Head XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	 "The shin bone is often broken and declared to the interior and exterior parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 "And the restoration of it happens like this, where you bind sinew above the fracture and another one below it.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	 "And with his leg stretched out in front of him.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	 "Then he extends all ligaments so that they are equally balanced on the part and this is when there is a fracture in the middle of the bones.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 "If the fracture is close to the shin bone's root, then it will be sinew bound to the chin side so that the extension goes upwards and another one below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	 "And in similar fashion if there is a fracture close to the knee, then it will be sinew bound near the knee so that the extension goes downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	 "Then the physician equalizes both hands with their own sinew and until it is reduced to its proper shape according to the nature of the figure; it is then bound together through a good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	 "Then you must apply plaster and bandage if there was no damage to that member.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	 "If you injured it then remove the plaster and bandage after a few days so that the member is cold; thereafter return to your care.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	 The stricture is such and so
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	 A stricture should be removed by applying pressure to it from both sides until the bone is broken through its thickness. That means binding and stretching simultaneously on one side or two sides alternately while pulling out excess flesh
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	 Afterward, apply pressure to the heel from beneath it until both are released.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	 Insert a long thread between the thigh and calf up to the knee near the bottom, so that both extremities extend from the top of one half of the body parts to the top of another half.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	 Afterward release pressure on the thigh and calf which is excess from beneath it.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	 Afterward place a stick over the thigh where the fracture was made above this, and then apply one stick on top of the heel.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	 After that, attach both thighs with strips to equalize pressure so as not to damage the bone from too much force.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	 Begin by applying pressure with great force at its middle where the fracture is made through three or four solutions.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	 And if you make the strip longer at the place of the fracture so that it becomes smaller and softer and less tough.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	 Afterward, attach both extremities to each other as before between thighs and calf.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	 Finally tie three sticks which are above with one another.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	 Afterward push downward on both extremities to the foot so that you break it free from below.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	 And tie together also the extremities of sticks with one another, in order not to remove the ligament at its place itself.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	 Afterward release pressure on this so that there is no damage to the member or limb from below, nor breakage of the nail, nor swelling, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	 If you do not succeed in removing it without harm
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	 And repeat the solution to that place until it is corrected as described many times before.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	 If you are unable to remove by bone what bites the bone then you must apply pressure from above until that is equal if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	 If not found, remove it and cure what precedes it until it is healed
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	 And when the heel fracture occurs without adding stars to it, just as we said in support and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	 However, in restoring such a fracture, there is no risk of paralysis or weakness.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	 If it is restored only, without applying another heel to it, then he must walk with the one that belongs to him always.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	 And you know that the heel is stretched for 50 days or added and reduced according to its different kinds of complexion and disposition.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	 Of the restoration of the bone fracture in the knee.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter Sixteen
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	 You know that bone fractures are rare in the leg but often occur due to wear and tear.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	 If it occurs only to him as a fracture, then either an opening or a hole should be made on its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	 This is with the aid of a tool and without one.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	 And it is raised entirely with the help of understanding.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	 The restoration of that is thus done so that the restored thing matches what was torn from its parts with your hands until it is complete and then connected according to what can be derived by calculation and ease, and making.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	 Then place a plaster of flour and egg white or milk on it; and put over that round stars if they are ready; and stretch it with strength above as much as to it.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	 Then consider all the dispositions that we mentioned in other fractures; such as cold irons and similar things; so that you should act with everything that can happen to him until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	 Of the restoration of the bone fracture in the knee joint.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter Seventeen
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	 You know that the knee has two bones; one is large and named after it, and the other is fine and called phalanges.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	 "A bone was broken in two places and as a result of this injury the arm had to be restored; thus restoring an equal limb to its original state.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	 "If two bones are simultaneously broken, it becomes an emergency situation where all parts become converted (reassembled).
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	 "If a bone is fractured slightly, only the anterior portion is restored.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	 "If a larger bone is broken, it will be inferior to that which was not hidden from you; and this operation must not obscure what is not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	 "Then administer the correct stretching, straightening, and stitching as needed according to it in equal measure.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	 "However, if the arm is broken and there are many injuries present (as in a battle), let extension be shorter than normal and healing take longer.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	 "And in the arm there is an operation performed on top of the arm; and it will be as if you have equally stretched the elbows, and completely perform all your operations. Take two cords from the pinewood which is put down under tables: and they are to become like the palm branches: and choose those with a larger size, not from small ones: and its length should be according to the length of the arm from the elbow downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	 "Then bind the skin with two stitches on both sides according to the length of it.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	 "Put one part of the arm onto another and alternate them from elbow to heel.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	 "Then tie two cords with three stitches, at each end, equally spaced.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	 "As long as the arm is in its correct position and you continue to administer correctly, it will recover.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	 "Then administer the bandage from the wood according to the length of the arm and put it on the arm so that it supports him with movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	 "Moreover, if there is a fracture when it has not been caused by an external injury, you should do more of these operations as needed.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	 On the final day of each week and during every study session with him until he is exhausted from fasting or other external causes
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	 If something happens to him during that period of time (that he is studying with Albucasis), then let the following be done by his side: whatever needs doing until such a point as God wills it should be done.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	 Regarding the bones and joints of the foot and hand.
Caput XVIII.	 The eighteenth book
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	 Only once during that period did he suffer a break in his ankle.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Regarding the bones of the foot and hand sometimes fractures occur and so do fractures of the fingers; but not all at once unless there is a fall in several positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	 If the foot's bone is broken then he lifts his leg to rest on the ground as an invalid does when he falls.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	 Then you lie down and place your foot on what has been made by the broken bones; later praise it, or call out for help; but until then keep still and be quiet where you are.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	 Then he lays his mat beneath him and places a thin plank beneath each foot having two flat surfaces.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	 Then tie it down with the other end after you have used it as a pillow and the others to whom it is appropriate.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	 After three days or four, then let the rope go loose.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	 You make sure both the bones and joints are either broken, fractured, or dislocated when you put on your shoes and boots.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	 The operation is done there as such.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	 If any of your fingers break then you restore them and do the same for each finger that I showed you how to repair hands.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	 Then you place your finger's astillam according to the length of each finger and make it wider than that; then you put under the foot this plank as I showed you how to do and tie it down with the rope securely.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	 If the bone is broken into two or three pieces, then hold onto all of them with a single finger and use that to draw out the string on the palm: And when you have drawn it down through the heel of one foot, let its tail hang outside as you keep tension by holding both ends.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	 And when you have done this, do not neglect the things I told you about other broken bones and all that pertains to accidents we mentioned; for oppose every accident with what is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	 About the fracture of a woman's ulna bone, in her arm and man's arm.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter Nineteen
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	 When a woman's ulna breaks, hold it with a square grip.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	 Then tilt her towards the side of her back further and hold onto the rear end.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	 The midwife will then apply a dressing to it until she has applied it evenly; and make the ulna into a sphere as smooth as if made of wax.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	 Then the woman lies down and stretches out her arm gently.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	 And this will be done until it has become level in front of the ulna like a sphere; and its mouth is broken open.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	 Then place a small sponge over her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	 When he is done kneading gently and has moved it onto her back, then knead lightly; reduce by the same amount you reduced it by initially; and then move it towards its first sponge again.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	 It will be done in seven days or as near to that time; for indeed he will restore the mouth of it back whole.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	 And if there is an obstruction, take the hollow sheath of the bone; and tighten it onto its canal with the help of the tendons; insert the whole sheath into the ulna of her.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	 Then blow gently through it until the sheath is inflated inside the ulna; for indeed its mouth will be broken.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a dressing to it and hold off some days until we have spoken as to when it should be done; for indeed it will heal.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	 When the windpipe is broken either by man or woman then administer to restoration of it, and its balance will be found as we have described it in the bone of Anchae
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	 Nor should a man's or woman's rectum be hidden when it is broken, which rarely happens and especially to those who have much study or use
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	 And read my book thoroughly, for the fracture itself means to you that the right of restoration and the restraint on it are many. Therefore understand
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	 When a man's windpipe is broken, take the bird feathers; insert them into him.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	 Then place over it a solution from the cloth and it is done (i.e., insert into him), or otherwise as many days as there are until he becomes better if God willed it
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	 For the restoration of bones when there's a fracture with a bone.
Caput XX.	 Head XX
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	 He who has a bone fracture with a blow to the head is especially treated as if it were the pelvis or assistant's hand, in order that he may be quickly relieved by phlebotomy; should you find conditions for phlebotomy (i.e., symptoms) according to our description.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	 If the blow caused blood to flow, then immediately apply phlebotomy so that the ulcers are removed; if not present at your hand, you must apply immediately as described.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	 Then begin to restore the fracture on that day itself and do not delay it, if no other has been hit by an arrow.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	 If a hot arrow has struck him then postpone the restoration of his fracture until after one day; until he no longer feels pain from the arrow.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	 Do not approach to him on the third and fourth days, nor thereafter if you were to bring upon him bad accidents.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	 If the windpipe is broken high above the throat then it must be reduced to its place with you, and made equal with your hands in ease and extent.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	 If the extension is not prepared for him and his balance cannot be restored by your hands, then reduce it to this instrument
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 It is an instrument made of iron, the length of which is equal to seven or eight digits; and its breadth is proportional to the amount of your nails
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	 For that reason it is necessary for a doctor to take three or four of them according to the amount he needs from this instrument after being broken in all respects
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	 It is round; and its size is equal to that of a pear so as not to be doubled up when compressed during the time of an operation; but it has sharp edges such that there is room for the fingers on both sides of itself.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	 It sits above with respect to its size, from just below it up to the bottom.
Et haec est forma eius.	 This is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	 It is suitable for this operation so that its sharp edge can be placed on the protruding finger or thumb; and with it alone pull back when he has emptied his mouth and reaches an equilibrium through some balance.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	 Therefore, align both fractured limbs in one direction.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	 If the limbs of his are broken and he cannot grasp it with a good grip because of that, then let him try to strike one of its extremities onto another extremity of his own, until the instrument has power over him.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	 If you cannot reduce them with him as we have described, then strike him with an instrument in any way that is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	 After striking it to the bone from its sharpness and fine texture, release your own weapon.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	 Therefore, when you have reduced the mouth and he is relieved from severe pain, then know that his mouth cannot return to its original position.
Fac ergo illud.	 Do this.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	 Thus the restoration of your strength is completed as you have done with your hands.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	 "The finger must be washed with vinegar.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	 And it is proper that there should be water used for washing.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	 Nor apply any oil above the nail, lest it cause infection and decay of the flesh near it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	 Then administer the pills to you at your hour for restoration of bones.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 Then wash off the finger nails so that you strike with a hammer through the holes into the proper position according to quantity of bones.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	 Be careful not to pull the nail apart when it breaks.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	 Many surgeons of old did practice this method on the sick or dying, causing death by cutting through bones and flesh, eating away at the bone itself, i.e., the bone was eaten up.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	 Your grip should be soft, flexible, different from those of broken bones' remnants.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	 If the nail is bad or large, and some very bad accidents happen on top of it, causing great pain near the spot; then you should not apply anything above that at all.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	 Then provide solutions from hard nails in place so they can be struck with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	 When the day has passed one or two days and you see the nail starting to grow, then wash it off with vinegar above where you placed it on top of itself using vinegar.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	 Then administer the medicines and ointments as we have always done for our wounds; such as the ointment Tetrapharmacion, and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	 And it is fitting to you so that there are only bonds left.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 Consider the nail every day morning and evening until it settles down and heals.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	 It is fitting that you will prepare the body in this manner so that the discharge from above may go down to below with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	 If many days pass and it does not heal or consolidate, then you know that the bones near there are already broken off.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	 Certainly! The Latin phrase translated directly from medieval Arabic is "When you seek (for something), grasp it with your hands.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	 Indeed, when removed are the attachments that bind them apart, remove her and then take her herself.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	 And when those that are not detached remain attached to it and cause it pain by grasping the part of it, strike her with a blow so as to release her from all manner of binding constraints and obtain her in any way possible for you that thing.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	 When you strike the bound one with a blow or tear him apart, that is to say, either remove his head from among those who have been mentioned earlier and those who have been corrupted by putrefaction, or take some other way of escape; then it is necessary for you, having come to grips with each one as he has provided in his chapter on this matter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	 And from that in which it is necessary for me to remain silent when the mouth breaks and blood flows forth from between the teeth like those of a horse or dog, and those who provide support, and similar large ones among them; so as not to give him excessive attraction, since often death comes by this way too. So I let go of him until he has putrefied.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	 Indeed, if you stay alive for more than 21 days or 30.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	 Then give him a cure when it seems to you, and otherwise release him.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	 About the care of fractures that occur through the use of ropes or cords.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter 21
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	 Often death comes by this kind of treatment for fractures that occur through the use of ropes or cords.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	 Especially when it is about stitches; and it becomes detached from that figure on a member.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	 And sometimes it prevents the member's natural use of his own body.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	 Therefore consider at that point if the treatment is with a rope; administer medicines containing astringency like aloe and myrrh, and others, and bitter substances such as acacia.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	 In that case, either grasp some of those with a rope or all at once; and bind them with wine or vinegar or acid (wine acidity); then place them on the knotting above it, and tie them tight to the same good suture.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	 "Remove the stricture but not its cause from many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	 "Then remove that thing and try another one until the blockage is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	 "Cut through the same membrane from both ends with a sharp knife.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	 "The membrane is the property that needs to be removed, which cannot be done without cutting into it from both sides.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 "If the blockage is in a stone and tight and pressing urgently for removal, then find it from above his part, and cut off excess material to one side with some forceps until it can be removed; then treat that which was found, so that it may heal.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	 "After the membrane is restored and remains after this subtle, not according to its nature.
Caput XXII.	 "Chapter 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	 "When the fracture of the bones is restored and the membrane after it remains subtle and weak, then that thing cannot be done except for many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	 "Of one there is a solution and ligature of his; not according to what should be done but for many reasons: either the ligament's stricture or the excessive embrocation, until the nutrition run to it may be prohibited: or for too much abundance in non-his hour: or for lack of blood in the weak body, and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	 "The care of it is to feed a sick one, to make his body strong until he may multiply blood within him.
Et administra balneum.	 "And administer the medicine.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	 "And insert joy and gladness upon it [the sick person].
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	 "Then place a needle over the membrane so that many a picture can be drawn into him with much nourishment.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	 "And diligently administer to him with hot water so that the nourishment may run through it and return to its own nature.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	 "About the care of fractured bones when they are restored in a tortuous manner.
Caput XXIII.	 "Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	 "When the member already restored after healing of it tortuousness has come upon him or a blockage and its form becomes a member, yet the membrane cannot be prohibited from its operation naturally; therefore one does not need to give a sermon to him who exists so that he may break it with force.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	 "Many surgeons and restorers have come from foreign lands.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	 This operation is extremely difficult to perform, either causing death or great fear, so that it may be called fatal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	 The recent collapse and paralysis require a treatment with hot water; boiled herbs should be used that are soothing, such as those of the elder tree, its root, mallow, and others like them.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	 A plaster made with softened linen should also be applied; it is effective for relaxing muscles.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	 Or mallow roots can be used, or the lard of geese could also work; or you might use olive oil as well and apply them both.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	 Or fig leaves can be used too; or you might use pine resin mixed with columbine and other such things that help reduce swelling.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	 And sometimes paralysis can be treated by a combination of persistent friction, ancient, and gentle, which is like the treatment using human hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	 The limbs should be gently moved to all parts of the body in every direction possible.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	 If the body is already rigid and has been overcome with strong measures, then a firm grip of stone should be obtained to remove him from there; continue the treatment with the use of hands and incisions must also be made for those that are left behind due to the removal of swelling or bones with sharp instruments. And it should be applied with ease in this way using eagerness and persistence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	 Of the dislocation of the tongue.
Caput XXIIII.	 The 24th head
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	 Dislocation is the exit from the joint, where it was.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	 Because of this, motion should be avoided and the member's appearance restored.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	 It causes injuries to the sick and those who are already injured.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	 Therefore, when a dislocation occurs, it is necessary then to take immediate action for its restoration; there should be no delay whatsoever.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	 "When time is delayed, separation occurs at that place, and sometimes with it reduction of dislocations.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	 Therefore, it should not be done to prevent delay so that extension does not occur during the time of his separation.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	 Because many things cause spasms and pain accompanying them
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	 Indeed when that happens, then it is necessary to order an intravenous infusion of fluids.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	 Afterwards, until he has stopped moving away from the time of separation.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	 Afterwards it is moistened with a warm bath and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	 Afterwards, it can be reduced easily.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And everything else is cured along with that memory that has forgotten its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	 I have already ordered the bones of the dislocated, and also according to what preceded it in fracture, going from the upper part of his body all the way down to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	 Treatment for the lower jaw bone dislocation.
Caput XXV.	 The 25th chapter
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	 The two jaws are rarely dislocated.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	 And the dislocation of both is done in a manner similar to one of them.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	 Or they may be separated by movement from their places and softened slightly.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	 Or they may be separated by a complete dislocation until they are softened to the point of the chest and saliva is released as well as she can no longer hold her mouth shut and her tongue slips out with words.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	 When their dislocation occurs suddenly they return to many positions by themselves with a few, but when it is complete then they are returned to the normal position on their own.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	 If the dislocation is complete and integral then it needs to be treated immediately either with immediate reduction or otherwise; and it is important that he holds on tight by having the head held by someone else so as not to miss out on any pain, whether it was due to one part or another of his jaw.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	 Or if both jaws are dislocated then he holds onto two fingers each at once.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	 The fingers are removed from his hand
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	 And he will perform the surgery with great care and precision; freeing them to move the hands up and down at all times.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 The surgeon adjusts the amputated limbs and propels them until they reach their proper place (wherever that may be).
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	 If the surgery is difficult for him, especially if both hands are affected simultaneously; in that case he administers a mixture of warm water and oil to facilitate the process, until they become easier to separate (from each other).
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	 When they become equal and relaxed, and the arms weaken but do not soften (i.e., don't lose their firmness), then he places them over some kind of padding or cushion with a layer of wax on top; and oil is used for lubrication.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	 After that, they are tightened up again using soft bandages to regain some of the strength which had been lost.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	 He then sleeps on his back with a pillow between his head and two arms to prevent him from rolling over; not to chew or swallow anything (i.e., nothing goes down the throat). His mouth is bound gently in order that he may take only small sips of something, until the pain decreases and his limb is loosened up enough for the doctor to administer it with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	 He does not eat anything by mouth during or after surgery and avoids breathing in any air; he is given something to take orally until his arm is loosened up enough for him to swallow normally (i.e., he's given food).
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	 If the surgery is difficult for both arms at once and they become dislocated, then it may be necessary to apply heat frequently (in addition to oil) until they return to their proper place; there are also instances of severe fevers and heavy sweating that require additional measures or a change in diet towards purgatives.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	 When you know this has occurred, remember that it is a serious loss and many people who have suffered from such a thing may die within 10 days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	 The reduction of dislocations in the elbow (forearm) or any part of the arm
Caput XXVI.	 Twenty-sixth head
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	 The furcula cannot be dislocated from its own place because of its connection to the chest wall.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	 However, it may sometimes be dislocated externally; and this is felt by the sense.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	 The restoration of its connection to the chest wall allows for relief on the back and extending of the arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	 Therefore, when you join your palm with the right hand's strong grasp, she will be restored.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	 Then place it on her own clasp, and pull gently and firmly, until she is recovered.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	 Those that follow the elbow joint remain in their place, continuing with them without dislocation, unless rarely.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	 Whenever it is dislocated on one day; then you must reduce and equalize it according to what we have said, and prepare yourself for it.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	 Then place her back into her own clasp, and pull gently but firmly until she is restored.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	 And you must gently hold the injured one, with ease and tranquility, until he recovers his strength.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	 And with this same care, the extremity of the arm is reduced when it is separated even from its own place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	 Of the reduction of dislocated arms.
Caput XXVII.	 Twenty-seventh head.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	 It is known that the arm cannot be dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	 The first way is to dislocate it so that its lower end is pulled upwards towards the tip of a finger.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	 The second way is to dislocate it from near the chest wall.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	 And perhaps it may be dislocated externally towards the top of the arm; but this is rare.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	 It cannot be dislocated backwards for fear of hitting the shoulder blade.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	 And it cannot be dislocated forwards, due to the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	 It is most likely to dislocate and reduce downwards towards the tip of a finger; especially on those whose flesh is thin.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	 For when you pull it back in quickly, and release it quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	 In those whose flesh is abundant are they opposite one another; for their appetite grows with difficulty and their digestion with difficulty
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	 And some men have died from blows or illness and the arm is torn off by its fellow in a heated state; so that it is dislocated because of this occurrence
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	 Therefore you should seek out what happened to him until he has proven his story and then proceed with the treatment of that part of the body.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	 The dislocation is known when it is below and opposite to the wrist; distinguish between the dislocated arm and the healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	 You will find a difference between the two and distinguish the one at the top of the arm from the other; and you should grasp it under the chin as if it were your own hand so that you cannot weaken its grip on your shoulder but cannot move it with all your movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	 Similarly if the dislocation is above or to the side; then you should find a visible touch and it cannot be hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	 And this kind of dislocation reduces easily when there are no longer any restrictions on his movement or he is young.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	 The reduction of that part will be so you can let your hand go to the top.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	 Then put your fingers under it and gently pull with strength towards the top; you will release the grip while extending to its own place and then let go of the hand.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	 And afterwards he puts her back down below and straight away releases or moves her quickly
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	 If he does not release as we have described and there are many days from the beginning when dislocation occurs; then it is necessary that a cold bath be given to him, so that he may recover through the use of embrocation which soothes and cools just as if the roots were cut off by frost or the leaves of the apple tree wither in water and so on.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	 Then he is placed back down onto his back; and put under it the sphere of wool that lies between restraint and freedom.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	 Then lay the surgeon upon his heel and lift up his head with a stroke of skill, then stretch out his arm to bring it down gently
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	 And another assistant should hold onto the surgeon's head so that it does not move downwards; he himself will soon be lifted up again.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	 And if you wish to bring his body down this way; he will be lifted up by an assistant on the opposite side so that it lies flat and its arm is brought downwards under control of the assistant, then lifted upwards towards himself from there until the limb is held suspended in the air
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	 And another assistant should hold onto the surgeon's hand so that it moves downward; he will be brought up again by an assistant on the opposite side.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	 If the limb is weak and should not move; then it's necessary to hold onto him something else so that he can be lifted up again; as for the dislocation, this will happen quickly.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	 And can also be brought down by another method; as when a long stick with a round head is used so that it may rest on the ground like the hand of death which should not be heavy nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	 Then lay him under after he is laid on a long stick; and then the limb will remain in place according to the length of the stick.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then his hand is stretched out to its opposite side and the body from the other side with strength; as for the joining together it will be in place with a firm connection.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	 And if the reduction of his body is difficult through all that we have described; then use this care; and it will be as when you take a stick whose length is equal to the sum of two arms, its width is equal to four fingers, its thickness is equal to the sum of two fingers, its head rounded so that he may be lowered into the depths with control in this shape.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	 Then wrap a soft stick around his round head to prevent him from falling off.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	 Then lay him under the control of an assistant so that his hand may be stretched out or be held by a stick above it all the way down to its opposite side; and bind the stick above the other arm and the end of the hand with binding materials.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	 In order that the arm be placed on the steps and extended downwards towards the lower part of it so that the hand is moved to its lowest extent while leaving the other body suspended in support
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	 The stroke should immediately follow.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	 When the entrance is thus completed according to whatever manner possible, it must be done that one places an equal quantity of wool balls beneath [the patient's] ear.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	 After the above, apply a pre-prepared plaster from flour mixed with water and egg white on all of his body as was done previously.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	 After all of that, tie the plaster bandage tightly and it should be able to hold up well. The arm will then be extended upwards towards its body as was previously mentioned and is left immobilized for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	 It must also be done that the limb of the sick person be placed so as to be in a comfortable position for its recovery since it is one of the means towards his health improvement.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	 After seven days or five, when he's placed on a stretcher and moved to somewhere suitable.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	 If it then becomes firm but does not loosen up, at that time the sick person is cured.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	 If the stroke occurs due to excessive moisture that has happened [to him] or because of another reason, it must be done so that a cautery is administered with three holes as was mentioned before in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	 If everything is done as mentioned above and the bandage loosens after seven days without being tightened up again, it must be cut off and thrown away because it cannot stay fixed to him and he will not be able to raise himself up with his arms stretched out or loosened up either: then you know that the hand injuries are made.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	 Or if a dislocation occurs on the breastbone or nipple, or towards the back, it can be done with the use of force and stretching with the hands until it is no longer there after which the remaining bandage must still be applied so that he may heal.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	 If the wound is treated after a certain period of time has passed and there is swelling and slowness in motion due to it, then that member becomes weak from lack of blood flow many times over, until finally the pain subsides and returns to its original nature
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	 Of dislocations involving the Cubitus.
Caput XXVIII.	 Head 28th.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	 If the cubitus joint is dislocated with difficulty and also returns to its original position with difficulty as well; it itself may dislocate from all parts especially towards the anterior or posterior regions.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	 The dislocation of that joint is not hidden from you because it lies beneath the hand and under touch; according to whatever position it may be dislocated in.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	 When you connect a dislocated Cubitus with a healthy one, that is clearly visible to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	 The joint becomes swollen and cannot simultaneously use the arm; it can only move while separate from it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 It is necessary that you should make haste to restore the joint immediately before any cold comes upon it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	 If a cold attacks that member, then the reduction of its dislocation becomes difficult; perhaps it will not recover at all, especially if it is towards the posterior region.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	 The dislocation itself has many forms and its pain increases; sometimes they even fall with death accompanying them.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 The restoration of that joint when it can be reduced is as follows: the hand is extended with two hands; the arm is fully expanded and the hands of a physician are above and below the joint, while itself it presses down on the dislocation by using both its hand or the palm's root until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	 Alternatively the dislocation can be towards the anterior; then it returns in this way to double up its hand with its own hand until it strikes against the dislocated Cubitus's root.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	 If the dislocation cannot be reduced then administer an intensive and strong stretch; it is as follows that two ministers expand the arm while holding onto it from both sides so that it may not be moved away by stretching.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	 After having been moved away from its original position above one's hand due to a broken strap on the forearm or wrist being stretched too far
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	 And when the surgeon joins up with oil on his own hand after having cleaned it himself with lubrication, making use of those that are applied to facilitate the joining process
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	 The joining motion is completed by a strong force.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	 After the reduction of it (the strap) is necessary to put it on top of its own wrapping, which provides support and allows for proper movement; then stretch and tighten with a bow tie in order to achieve the desired tightness.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	 And the arm is lowered from the shoulder to the elbow after having been reduced by a certain amount of time.
Deinde soluatur.	 The motion is completed.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	 If the joining operation becomes solid at its own place, then remove it (the strap) immediately afterwards and dispose of it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 If you find that the joining is not done properly, then try again with another wrapping and remove (the strap) after a certain amount of time has passed, until tightening occurs.
Deinde solue ipsam.	 The motion is completed.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	 If the joining process causes the strap to be injured after reduction, then make adjustments according to motion; that is, administer wet dressing in bathing water and apply rubbing and compressing techniques until the wound is closed or if it is put over the joining point (the strap), as long as a small piece of flesh remains.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	 And tie up again with another strap after day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	 And remove it afterwards from that place in a bath
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	 After cleaning up, apply rubbing and tightening techniques to the joining operation.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	 Repeat this process with another strap after each one, until it is done properly.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	 If there's a knot above the joining point (the strap), wet it with butter, apply heat and tighten on top of that.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	 Do this repeatedly until it is done properly.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	 The flesh is removed and returned to its own place
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	 Of cuts
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter 29
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	 The hand is cut through multiple times, meaning the incision made between the arm and hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	 Reduction of this injury is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	 After cutting off all fingers
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	 However it is necessary that the wound should be bandaged before it has been dislocated and afterwards, to prevent a cold or hot object from coming into contact with the injury at the time when the dislocation occurs.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	 The reduction of the dislocation is to place a soft bandage over the hand and extend it across so as to support the arm; and then put on the doctor's palm that incision which was made, so that he may move it gently downwards until it becomes detached.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	 However it is necessary to consider if the palm has already retracted towards the other hand; in that case the arm supports its back over the bandage at extension and reduction, so that the hand may be placed on top of the incision with its inside part against the bandage, meaning that only the inner part of the hand should be put on it.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	 If so he does quickly well; and if not, then tie her with a bandage and let him go loose, that is do nothing further.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	 If it does not tolerate the reduction of its dislocation after a day has passed away, then the incision remains as per the tortuousity of its own; and nothing else is harmful except for what softens the hand, nor can anything be tied on; you see that the nails have been broken off or torn.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	 It should not happen by chance but should be bandaged gently for its benefit.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	 And perhaps nothing else may occur.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	 As it does not do with the hand of Almahassem then put a bandage over him so that we might bind or tie it in place.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	 After five days, it is bandaged and then taken off; after that it is soaked in a solution, then wrapped again and used for surgery
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	 If the movement of his hand is restrained and held in that way for some time, it will become soft; he then gently washes it with warm water, rubs it vigorously a few times to soften it, until it becomes soft
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	 Of the treatment for dislocated fingers
Caput XXX.	 Head of John Doe.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	 When the fingers are dislocated in such a way that they touch all parts of the body or rest on the palm of the hand, or between them and you want to release it: first extend your finger(s), then press down on their dislocation with both hands until it is released.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 After that, support the head of the finger and suspend it towards where it was dislocated, then let it rest for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	 After that, hold him tightly while straightening his fingers, until they are equal to their former state on the day after.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	 When you have finished with him for the night, bind his hand according to its own way of binding and do not relax him during that day; then exercise him with movement, but bind him at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 Do this on several days until it is bandaged.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	 And similarly do with him if the fingers are dislocated between them; bind him to his own way of binding and perform your first surgery on him until he is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	 Do this when they are dislocated in any other part as well.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	 Of the treatment for dislocated shoulders.
Caput XXXI.	 Head of John Doe.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	 If the shoulders are dislocated or completely torn apart by falling forward with both arms at once; do not try to treat it as there is no cure and death comes quickly from weakness.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	 Its sign is that the release of its strength without resistance cannot be held by it; and certain members of his body may lose parts or become weakened in this way from him as well
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	 "Many things are moved when many things move away from each other towards four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	 And if something is moved to the rear part [of the body], it is called gibbositas
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	 Therefore its cure must be sought out if you remember that gibbositas happened to the youth; then there is no care for it, nor any healing from all diseases.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	 But if this happened through case or impact, the ancients said many modes of treatment in a long and difficult speech.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	 Which one did not return with great success.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	 I myself already mentioned that from it to the one whose fault was partly mine and who was nearby my intent: with my exposition which I showed him, and I formed his tool in a different way from how they presented this thing to me
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	 Therefore, that which was moved away from the preceding part of [the body] is not a result of its own nature nor healing by it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	 Similarly, if this happens towards two sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	 And it is not cured from them except that which happened in the back part as I mentioned; and there was one to extend [the body] upwards towards its own face over a level platform nearly up against the wall: and to expand under him moist bandage so he may not be harmed by his chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	 Afterwards, a fixed straight piece of wood is put into the ground at its lower end on the earth; another one around the head and another one around the feet near to the other side [of the foot]; he holds it tight so that it may not be loose in the hole.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	 And the second holds the second piece.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	 Afterwards lift up the head of him with his hands loose but holding it tight; and extend its end to bind that piece at his head firmly and bind him on that part [of the body].
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	 Afterwards tie another piece over his ankles; above his knees too; above his thighs as well; and at his calves [of the legs].
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	 "And remove all ligaments and tie them on another bone which is below his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	 "Then he extended all the ministers to the bone of the ligaments and did not remove two bones from their places where they were fixed; however, these are not set firmly as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	 "And the doctor put his hands on the spine with strength until he was exhausted; or placed it on a table.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	 "Then he fixed his feet on top of the table until he was exhausted.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	 "If not by this treatment, then take a tablet whose length is about three times his arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	 "And so put the place where we said it should go near to being weakened and insert the extreme of the tablet into him.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	 "Then he placed a middle tablet on the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	 "And the doctor placed his feet near to another extreme.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	 "Then he tightened well and until it was bent by the spine, and until it was exhausted at its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	 "Afterwards if you are able to operate using a turn-around and what he had used with your hand; it is that way the figure stands on the ground at his head near to two bones of the feet whose length is one arm, and at his feet near to two bones from the feet whose length is also one arm.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	 "The length that is between all the bones of one hand; and it has been done everywhere a hole through which the arrow runs; and every bone will be firmly set down on the ground much.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	 "And an oblong bone is inserted; it was a hole through which he pulled the ligament from two bones of two rods.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	 "And at his extreme there is a hole through which the bone will be fixed whose length is between his hand and what was pulled; and similarly with two other rods.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	 "Then you tighten the ligaments that were torn from his chest using a turn-around which is below his head; and the ligaments that were torn from his limbs with another turn-around which is below his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	 The thumb is held by every surgeon who performs the operation on his hand with a bandage soaked in medicine until the wound has healed completely.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	 This is the form of a tourniquet which follows this pattern.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	 After applying the plaster bandage soaked in excitant oil to the wound and it has been applied evenly, then it is time to apply the tourniquet.
Deinde stuppam.	 The tourniquet must be tightened.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	 After the plaster bandage has been placed and stretched over a surface of three fingers' width or around them, it is necessary to tighten the tourniquet.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	 The length of it should be such that its thickness does not exceed the space between the fingers and is even on the healthy side of the thumb.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	 It must then be tightened with a bandage which we have mentioned before, until complete healing occurs.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	 And it is fed with a subtle nourishment until it heals completely.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	 If anything of importance has happened at the place where healing is occurring and it does not heal completely in its final stages: then it is necessary to administer the medicines that alleviate pain until the bandage has been used for a long time, as mentioned before.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	 And now the bandage soaked in excitant oil must be applied there again.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	 If anything of importance happens at the place where the thumb is being removed and it comes out with a dislocation, then there must be an application of that which has already emerged to restore its function.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	 This is because if he were given this medicine it could potentially cause his death instead of healing him as intended.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	 Of the dislocation of Ancha
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter 32
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	 It is known that the injury to Ancha and the elbow joint did not happen unless it was a dislocation only; neither of them happened as if caused by something else in the other joints' remote places or with violence.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	 The injury to Ancha is done according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 This means that the dislocation of Ancha can happen towards both the front and back of her body.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 The most of it is dislocated towards the internal parts; very little moves towards the front side, and even less towards the rear side.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	 The care of dislocation is towards the internal parts; because when you join a sick limb with a healthy one, it takes longer and there is more upward movement than in the healthy part, but he cannot make both legs stand upright at once on an uneven ground: and there is a track following behind that has been heated up to be able to remove the head from its place.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	 The sign of his dislocation towards the external parts is: it was an injury contrary to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	 The sign of his dislocation towards the front side is: it spreads out the healthy limb according to its complement; however, he cannot extend himself without pain in the knee and when walking forward cannot reach the front as well as before, the urine will be retained and the foot behind him will move upwards on the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	 The sign of his dislocation towards the rear side is: he cannot extend himself and cannot reach forward before extending both legs; there is a shorter leg and the foot behind him will be more bent upwards, and the head behind will remain in its place.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	 The reduction of this dislocation is that you should consider that if it is a false dislocation which has already become old and has been accompanied by the same person in the past.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	 Then if you administer its reduction, it remains according to her own disposition; at that time there is no care for all of them.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	 Therefore, it must not be that he suffers a penalty.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	 In the person whose dislocation is being discussed now and there are four signs of dislocation in him at that time it should be followed as follows to join them together and extend her towards both the internal parts and external parts, and move her with your right and left; for perhaps she will rise up again.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	 If not in this way, then you should prepare a strong remedy and extend her the foot from its lower part; or with your hands, or with a bandage that is tied over her foot above the knee; another one extends his hand on top of it so that he can put his hands underneath hers.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	 "With a ligature tightened above the hip joint and holding with the other ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	 "This is to stretch either towards the anterior aspect of the thigh or to the posterior aspect of the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	 "Or it may be stretched uniformly in all directions until he falls with his body to the ground and remains hanging there.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	 "The nature of this stretch is that of a common stretching for four limbs.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	 "If the dislocation occurs as described, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to do everything that I have said about self-curating.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 "If the dislocation occurs towards the interior of him when he is in reduction, it should be as if the patient lies on his healthy back.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	 "Thereupon ligatures are placed over the hip joint, in the place between the head of the thigh and the knee.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	 "Then stretches it to the upper aspect of the leg towards the higher part of his body, then to the posterior aspect of the back.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	 "Thereupon takes hold of his stronger arms and makes a large stretch over the injured hip joint, then extends it to the external direction.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	 "I remain in my place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	 "The nature of this stretch is easier than the others that I have described when we are curing a member.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	 "If you fail or can not go on with this stretch when I am curing, then it is necessary to do as follows. Ligate the two lower limbs with one strong ligature and another tight with a ligament over both calves, over both knees, over both thighs: And let each of them be stretched towards his opposite leg four times.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	 "Thereupon the patient is suspended over a beam that lies within our home, and it remains stretched towards each of them as much as two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 "Afterwards command the strong man to support his head and to suspend him with a second ligature; then pull towards each of them and help together by force, for the ligament was attached to its place when it is held by you.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	 In its own version when dislocation occurs to external, it should be necessary that the patient lies on a platform as we illustrated in having a hump or protuberance.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	 And tighten ligaments over his thighs and over his breastbone
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	 Then they are placed two wooden planks, one under the legs of him, and another under the top of his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then the additional wooden plank is placed at the middle of his legs and firmly fixed so that it doesn't allow him to slip away when wet clothes are put over; also a wooden plank should be placed between his thighs to prevent his legs from being pulled downwards by extending movement.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	 Then the assistant moves all the way down to the patient's side and the physician holds back the reduction with their hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	 If so, it is a good thing.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	 And if not, put the same board over his chest and below as we illustrated for the hump or protuberance equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 However, it is necessary that the patient lies on a healthy thigh length wise.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	 When the dislocation is to anterior, then it should be necessary that the patient's leg is extended by his own effort or else he will assist with his right hand and place a palm on the knee of him.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	 Then support him with one other hand while with another he should extend his leg to the lower part of his knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	 If the dislocation is to posterior, then it should not be necessary that he extends himself downwards and lies on the ground; however, if he dislocates his shoulder towards the outside, we must place him as before over two planks so that both arms can reach out to support and the extensive ligaments are stretched according to what we said previously.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	 It is necessary that a compression should also be applied at the place from where he will receive the joint and after the reduction has been completed according to what is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 "Thou art not hidden from the sign of his redemption; and if you stretch out two limbs to him, he will seize with both hands his breast (the crus) and extend it without any excuse: then thou knowest that now has been given a limb as is necessary; then you bind up the two thighs together, lay on an implement, and tighten with rope, namely, stretched so that there may not be moved by any part of him towards one side or the other. And he will remain quiet in three days or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	 "Then you loosen the ligature and implement, and compare the legs together; then if you see that they are equal in their standing, then you know that the dislocation has already been fixed; so therefore the limb is now straight for walking.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	 "And if you see any softening of the leg; then remove it and the implement, and tighten it according to your first ligature; and give it also quiet in three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	 "Then you loosen that leg, make him rest a little while for walking over some time, until he is well-adjusted.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	 "Of dislocations of the thigh.
Caput XXXIII.	 "Thigh 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	 The thigh can be dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	 It can be dislocated externally, internally, and downwardly or downwards towards the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	 "And it is not dislocated forwards.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	 The sign of its dislocation is that the limb applies its leg towards itself in pain and discomfort.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	 "If it does not stay together with the thigh; then you know that the thigh has been dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	 "The restoration of all the modes for its dislocation is that you make him rest the straight limb; so that now it can extend if it is able to the leg on top, and keep your back against his face; and put the foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	 "Then you hold it with your hands to the thigh on top of him; and place them straight over his thigh between your fingers.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	 In order to apply with your hand two lateral surfaces of his knee joint when he is in a state of strength
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	 And another assistant extends the foot towards him until it reaches its place (i.e., his knee).
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	 The sign of relief was put on so that he could grasp the thigh while lying down without exertion.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	 He then grasps him and holds tight to the thigh.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 And at that time (i.e., when he has grasped it) he will hold onto it with both hands for 2 or 4 days depending on how long his hand stays attached to the thigh.
Deinde solue ea.	 And then he releases him.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	 Unless he is too weak and cannot walk around for a certain number of days until he recovers.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	 If however you refuse to release him and insist on trying to move his body again with the aid of strong assistants who support his ankles while they are being described (presumably as part of a medical treatment) until he recovers.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	 The cure for dislocated ankles
Caput XXXIIII.	 The 14th Chapter
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	 The ankle can be pulled away from its normal position or dislocated by force at right angles to itself.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	 The dislocation is either towards the inside of his leg or towards the outside
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	 The sign of dislocation was put on so that you can inflate and position his ankle so it is dislocated in such a way as to heal faster.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	 The cure for dislocation is easy and quick: just have assistants hold his ankle while it is being pulled towards the right position with ease using their hands so that once it has been moved to its place he will be held on until he recovers.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	 When dislocation occurs towards the inside of his leg however you must ensure that he is not made to lie on an uneven surface and assistants hold him while being held gently by strong men from behind who support his feet so they are at right angles with each other in the middle of it until he recovers.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	 You should then hold his right foot towards its top part and with your left hand from below the lower part of his feet until you reach each ankle separately.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	 And then pull it towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	 "On both sides.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	 "Extend on the left and pull towards the belly with the right foot, without effort (or: without strain).
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	 "Do it twice as we did before.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	 "Pull the belly towards the heel on the third time, and you will draw the rope.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	 "If so returned on the first time (that is, if you pulled him towards the heel in one motion), or twice as we did before and both feet equally equaled, then this was a good thing; but if not, do it again over his body: for he himself has done it.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	 "If you are not allowed to pull him with him as we did before, then let go of the rope while standing on your back and place a firm peg in the ground at one side so that he falls between his legs: and you will have pulled the sheet over it.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	 "Then receive the foot of him as his minister; after that, let your other minister extend it, either with your hands or with a rope tied above the leg.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 "Then let every minister stretch against his own comparison (that is, the ministers of both feet should extend equally), so that the peg may remain between two legs holding him up without drawing his body towards the lower side.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	 "Then let your other minister hold tight to the good foot towards the lower side.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	 "The dislocation was accompanied by fatigue.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	 "Then declare the health of his restoration to you; and fasten tightly with a peg and a rope, and tie it firmly with a strong cord, and bind the leg with its band towards the heel.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	 "And you must make sure that when you pull or push from the posterior part of his heels above, they do not carry the cord over them, and let go of them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 "Then release him in two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	 "If the band becomes slack, tie him up again; and then release him on the third or fourth day, or after forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	 "If a man is able to walk before reaching that space without fear of dislocation occurring and dissolution following from it, security does not exist; otherwise he must prepare for its destruction.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	 "If you deliver him a cold cup of water at that moment (i.e., during the process), then it is necessary for you to administer his medication there, which precedes our narration elsewhere due to care and anointing; otherwise remove the result.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	 "Regarding the dislocation of a finger or hand, cure [the cause].
Caput XXXV.	 "Head number 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	 "It is necessary for it to be made equal when dislocated with slight extension and without effort; however, that thing itself isn't difficult at all, but easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	 "If the dislocation occurs due to some knots of the forearm's finger(s), then it is necessary for him to support his foot on the ground or table in such a way that it is as if walking; and he remains like this until healed.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	 "Afterwards you remain there [i.e., supporting his foot on the ground or table], and place your hand upon that from which he is coming.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	 "And strike it with his foot along with vigor until it is redressed; and you should then strike him again to make him equal once more, and he will not appear to be superior.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	 "And place your foot beneath his feet as if it can support the entire foot; there are two hands for that purpose.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	 "And then stretch him with a decent cord over three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	 "Then remove him and make him rest from all movement for several days until he is stretched and securely reduced.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	 "Regarding the species of dislocations along with fractures.
Caput XXXVI.	 "Head number 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	 "When something happens to him and you cure his illness and restoration of it, many times there is death; and for that reason it is not necessary that he should become superior in the care of him as a result, which I have said earlier unless someone who is prudent with long use in the art of medicine, compassionate, pious, slow, without fearlessness, or extravagant. And to be used by doctors who administer cold bandages.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	 "Unless you wish for good health and salvation from damnation with gentleness and humility, there is no hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	 Therefore, reduce its severity at the very beginning of things before it can cause coldness to others.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	 If therefore you reduce the limb according to our wishes, then immediately administer a treatment that will make it healthy again; and care for wounds with its assistance in drying out through ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	 If the dislocation occurs with a fracture and they are separated by separating pains, then you must cure their wounds as we instructed earlier through it what preceded them from its simple remedies.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	 And so, according to your virtue and trust me when you come into the house of fear; according to what I have taught you before.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	 That is better for you with your Creator and remaining to glory, and more food for your body among those of yours at that time.
