There are many kinds of knots/nodes, of which I will describe all the appearances; and now I must explain all the differences between a knot/node and a growth/protrusion.	There are various kinds of cyst. We have already mentioned all their varieties in the proper place. But we need here to set forth the difference between a cyst and an abscess, for it is complicated.	0.6388382
I say that a growth/protrusion involves heat and persistent fever, until the boiling is over, and the putrefaction is complete; then the fever and heat subside.	The abscess will be accompanied by heat and fever and fearsome pain, until the boiling-up of the superfluous matter settles down and the suppurating process is completed: then will the fever and intensity subside.	0.7386488
With a knot/node, there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains a cyst, which is its own sac and is the same color as the body, and it begins like a speck and grows large; and they are of two types, either fatty or moist, and of many colors as I have said in the classification.	But with a cyst there is neither heat nor fever nor pains, and a membranous capsule encloses it, its own particular covering. The cyst is flesh-coloured, and it begins like a pea and becomes like a melon, more or less; and is of two kinds: either fatty or containing humidity; and the colours of the humidities are several, as we mentioned in the appropriate section.	0.8211846
It is necessary, when you come to treat a knot/node, that you first examine and explore it with the instrument called a "probe," according to its form, which will come in the chapter that follows.	When you come to treat the cyst, you should first sound it and examine it with the instrument called the explorer, which is figured in the next chapter.	0.69665515
And the way to examine the abscesses of the nodes is that you take the moistest place that you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, provided that it is according to the size of the abscess; then withdraw the probe, and pay attention to what comes out.	The way to examine all tumours and cysts is to take this instrument and press it in at the spot where the tumour is softest, and revolve it gently with your fingers till you know you have pierced the skin; then press it in proportionately to the size of the tumour. Then remove the explorer and see what comes out after it.	0.797467
If a thin, flowing moisture comes out, note what color it is, then lance it as I have said for other abscesses; and if no moisture comes out after the probe, know that it is fatty, then cut it crosswise, and take it with forceps, and peel it gently on each side and watch the membrane in which it lies so that you pull it out whole with the node; and if you cannot pull it out whole, pull it out in pieces so that nothing remains.	If a humidity should flow, whatever the colour, make a simple incision, as I said for the other tumours. But if no humidity come out along the track of the explorer you know at once that it is fatty. Therefore make a cruciform incision upon it in this shape, as I have told you, and attach hooks and dissect away the skin gently from all sides. Be careful with the capsule; if you can, get it out whole, together with the cyst.	0.8490341
For if anything remains, the node will return many times; and if a bit remains, and the blood troubles you, fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and bind the wound, and apply soothing things for a hot abscess, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed; and if the node is large, stitch the two edges of the wound, and treat it with what generates flesh.	For if a part of it is left behind, either great or small, the cyst will generally return. If it defeats you and some little piece of it remain, pack the wound, when you have done all you can, with some caustic powder and bandage it and put on it something to ease the inflamed tumour, and treat in the usual way until healed. If the tumour be large, sew the edges of the incision together and treat with stimulants.	0.78011906
And if the pulsating vein or other things hinder you, hurry and fill the place with crushed vitriol, and leave it there for two or three days, until the wound rots, and the boiling of the blood subsides; then return to cutting out what remains of the node.	If you should come across a blood-vessel, pulsating or not, and there be haemorrhage, hasten to pack it with pounded vitriol; and leave bandaged for two or three days until the wound becomes purulent and the boiling-up of the blood is allayed; then resume cutting open the rest of the cyst.	0.8600895
