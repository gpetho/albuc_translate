The thirty-third chapter on cauterizing the beginning of humpbackedness.
This ailment frequently affects young children.
And the sign of its beginning in the child is that he experiences shortness of breath upon standing and moving.
And you will find at the end of the vertebrae of his back a bead that has protruded, elevated above the rest of the beads.
So if you see that and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery iron that is circular in this way:
Take the cautery on each side of the vertebra evenly.
And if you wish, cauterize it around the vertebra with the point cautery, two or three rows.
And let the points be close to each other.
Then treat the area until it heals with what we have mentioned.
And be careful to use the cautery in the hump that results from a spasm of the nerve.
