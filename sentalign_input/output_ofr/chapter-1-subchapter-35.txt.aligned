When you cut the fleshy growth, heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and then place it, burning hot, on the cut fleshy growth; and keep your hand there until the cautery reaches the base of the vein from which the blood flows; do this once or twice, and if there are many fleshy growths, cauterize each one as we have said; afterwards treat them with beneficial ointments until they are healed; and if you cauterize with a large cautery on the ischium, it will be more helpful.	When you excise warts, heat a spike-shaped cautery and bring it, hot, to the site of the excised wart, and press down till the cautery reaches the mouth of the vessel whence the blood comes. Do this once or twice over. If the warts be more than one, sear each one separately as we have described ; then dress with suitable ointments till healed. And if you burn the patient with one big cauterization over the lumbar region that will add to the effect.	0.8592938
