When someone experiences acute episodes affecting the eyes or chest, and this becomes chronic, and medication does not work, then the most effective treatment is to cut these two arteries.	When a person gets painful defluxions into the eyes or chest which become chronic, and medical treatment is ineffectual in this case, then section of these arteries will be the most efficacious treatment.	0.8302368
Therefore, if you intend to cut them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the artery appears, then tie the patient's neck with the excess of his garment, then look where the vein pulsates, and their locations are the two lowered places behind the ears, and they are rarely hidden except in some people, then mark them with ink, then cut them with a sharp scalpel down to the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.	When you decide on section, you should shave the patient's head with a razor; then rub the place with a rough cloth to show up the artery; then bind the patient's neck with an end of his garment; then you will observe where the artery is pulsating (the sites of both are the depressions behind the ears) for it is uncommon for them to remain hidden, except in a few persons. Then do you mark with ink over both; then cut with a hooked scalpel, cutting down to the bone; the incision should be lateral to the head.	0.8172176
And if you wish, you can insert the scalpel from under the artery and lift it upwards while cutting, and the length of the cut should be about two closed fingers, because when the vein is cut, the blood will come out in a pulsating flow, leaping forward in successive spurts.	Or if you prefer, introduce the scalpel beneath the artery and make a thrusting cut up at it. The incision should be of about two fingers' breadth. When cut, the artery gives out a pulsating jet of blood spurting intermittently.	0.77097917
If the artery is not apparent to the touch, then you should measure from the ear a distance of about three fingers, then mark it with ink and incise down to the bone.	If the artery is not discernible, you should measure three fingers' breadth from the ear, than mark with ink, and cut down to the bone.	0.92260426
It is advisable to let out six ounces of blood on average, and sometimes you may let out more or less, all depending on the patient's strength and the fullness of his arteries as it appears to you.	The quantity of blood that should be let is six ounces on the average, but often more blood, or less, is withdrawn; all in proportion to the strength of the patient and the fullness of the arteries as they appear to you.	0.8941715
Then look at the wound, and if any membrane remains on the bone, cut it so that a hot swelling does not occur, then tie the wound with a wick of linen cloth, then treat it with ointments until it heals.	Then examine the wound and if there remains on the bone any part of the membrane cut it off to avoid a haematoma. Then bind up the wound with a bandage of linen cloth and dress with ointments till healed.	0.8325819
