On the method of cauterizing for vitiligo (white patches).
Chapter 51.
When vitiligo has persisted and no medical treatments have been effective, then cauterize the area with a slightly deep cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and the color changes.
Then treat it with an ointment made from herbal flour, lentils with rose oil, plantain leaves, dove's blood, and swallow's blood; take an equal part of each, mix them together, spread them on a cloth, and apply it to the area until it heals.
