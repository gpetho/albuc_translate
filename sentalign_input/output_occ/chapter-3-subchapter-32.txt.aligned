On the treatment of a dislocated knee.	On dislocation of the knee.	0.7519523
The knee is dislocated in three ways: outward, inward, and downward but mostly backward; it is not dislocated forward.	The knee is dislocated in three ways; it is dislocated interiorly and exteriorly and inferiorly, that is, posteriorly. It is never dislocated anteriorly.	0.89070207
The sign of dislocation is when you ask the patient to bend their leg at the knee; then you will know that the knee is dislocated.	The sign of dislocation is to bid the patient flex his leg on his thigh, and if it does not reach the thigh you may know the knee is dislocated.	0.8342717
The method to restore any type of knee dislocation is to have the patient sit straight, extending their leg if they can; place your knees against their thigh, and put their foot between your feet; then place your palms on their knee, holding it firmly with your fingers, while another assistant extends their foot until the knee returns to its place.	The way of setting all the types of dislocation is to make the patient sit down with both legs extended, if he can, with an assistant sitting behind him to hold him by the middle and incline him slightly backward. Then do you yourself sit on his thighs with your back to his front, and put his leg between yours; then the palms of your hands should be applied to his knee, and join them together by twining the fingers; then with the palms put strong pressure on both sides of his knee while another assistant extends his foot until the knee goes back to its place.	0.877313
The sign of successful reduction is that the leg can be easily bent without pain.	The sign of its return is that the leg can be flexed back easily and without hindrance upon the thigh.	0.760985
Then apply a poultice and bandage the leg to the thigh, and wrap them together with a bandage for three to four days, and then unwrap them.	Then apply a plaster and flex the leg on to the thigh and bandage them together for three or four days; then loosen them.	0.9363769
The patient should not walk for a few days until they are healed and strengthened.	He should do little walking for some days until it gains strength.	0.65545404
But if you cannot reduce the dislocation, then perform strong extension with the same bandages used in the hip treatment described earlier.	But if you cannot effect reduction by this method, apply powerful extension by bandages as we have described above for the treatment of the hip, until it goes back.	0.7987898
