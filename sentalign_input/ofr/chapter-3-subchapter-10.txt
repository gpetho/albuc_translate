of the fracture of the hip bone
It rarely happens that the hip bone is broken, and if it does happen, it is only a small break at the head; and it runs lengthwise, and slopes downwards, and the patient feels pain in the area, and a pricking sensation, and swelling where it is broken.
And the restoration is that you extend your hand over it, until you are on the fracture; and know what the fracture is like and its shape; and if the fracture is only at the head, align this fracture so that it returns to its natural shape.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, where it slopes inward, have the patient lie on their stomach, so that the reduction of this fracture is accessible to you.
And when you have aligned it, apply the plaster, then put on a splint of wood or leather, and tighten the fracture so that it does not move; and fill the area under the ribs, so that the bandaging is even.
And instruct the patient to sleep on their healthy side, or on their back.
And if hot abscesses develop there, do not touch them until the hot abscesses have subsided, and apply what we have said before; and then return to the reduction, and tighten it as needed, if there is no bad outcome; and this is the method.
