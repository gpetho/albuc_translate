of the cautery of the head When a sudden pain comes in one part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head has been purged by cleansing medicines, and the other treatments that I mentioned in the division of illnesses have been done, and all this is not effective: then make cauteries for him in two ways, that is to say with a sharp medicine and with iron.	When there occurs pain with headache in one side of the head and the pain extends to the eye; and the patient has cleared his head with purging drugs and there has been applied the other treatment that I have mentioned in the sections on diseases, but to no avail; in this disorder cauterization is of two sorts, either with caustic or with the actual cautery.	0.82707524
The cautery with sharp medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and remove the skin and cut it a little at both ends, and then split the temple where the pain is in such a way that you can put the clove of garlic under the skin; and when it is put in, bind it and tighten it well and leave it like that for twelve hours; and then untie it and pull out the clove of garlic, and leave the wound like that for two or three days; then put on cotton dipped in butter until pus comes out.	This is the manner of cauterization with caustic: take one clove of garlic; peel it and cut both ends off; then cut open the site of the pain in the temple with a broad scalpel till there is room to contain the clove under the skin; then introduce it under the skin till it lies completely hidden. Then bind up the wound tightly over it with pads and leave for fifteen hours; then unbind it, remove the garlic, and leave the wound open for two or three days; then apply cotton wool soaked in butter till it suppurates.	0.8910179
Afterward treat it with ointment until it is healed; and if you wish, do this with some burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.	Then dress with ointment till it heals. If you would rather, you may carry it out with one of the caustic drugs that I have included in the eighteenth treatise, on caustics.	0.8544863
The cautery with iron is in this manner. Heat the cautery, of which this is the shape:	The actual cauterization with iron should be done in this way: heat a cautery of this shape.	0.7073411
And it is called "closed" because the head is made in the shape of a nail where it has a little curvature, and in the middle has a small appearance; and place it on the painful spot, and hold your hand and turn the iron a little lightly, so that half the thickness of the skin is burned; and lift your hand so that the artery, which is outside, does not burn, and from which an abundance of blood flows.	It is called the claviform; the head is nailshaped in that there is a slight curvature with a small protuberance in the middle. Apply it then to the site of the pain, hold your hand steady and revolve it little by little. Let the thickness of skin burnt be about half; then remove your hand so as not to burn a subjacent artery, for thus a haemorrhage arises.	0.76668245
Afterward, put cotton in salt water, and place it on the spot for three days; then put cotton soaked in butter there, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed; and if you want to cauterize this migraine with the cautery that is called "cultellar", use just the tip, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine which is not old.	Then soak some cotton wool in saline, apply to the place, and leave three days; then apply cotton wool with butter; then treat with ointment till it heals. Or if you prefer you can cauterize this migraine with the knife-edge that juts out from the cautery; but be careful not to cut an artery, specially in this kind of migraine that is non-chronic.	0.8549292
