After cutting them: When you have cut the wart, heat the cautery iron that resembles an awl. Then, insert it hot into the place of the cut wart, and push your hand in deep, until the cautery iron reaches the opening of the vessel from which the blood flows. Do this once or twice.	When you excise warts, heat a spike-shaped cautery and bring it, hot, to the site of the excised wart, and press down till the cautery reaches the mouth of the vessel whence the blood comes. Do this once or twice over.	0.7852176
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as we have described. Then, treat them with suitable ointments until they are healed. And if you cauterize them also with a large cautery on the cotton, it will be more effective.	If the warts be more than one, sear each one separately as we have described ; then dress with suitable ointments till healed. And if you burn the patient with one big cauterization over the lumbar region that will add to the effect.	0.86142254
