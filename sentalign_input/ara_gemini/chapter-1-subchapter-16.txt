Chapter sixteen on cauterizing the eyelid if its lashes turn inwards and prick the eye.
So cauterization in it is of two types: either cauterization by fire or cauterization by a burning medication.
As for cauterizing it with fire, you order the patient, before that, to leave his eyelashes, if he is among those who pluck them, until they grow long and even.
If it pricks him when they are growing, you tie his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they grow.
When they have grown and are even, place the patient's head in your lap.
Then mark on the eyelid with ink a mark in the shape of an ace of leaves.
And the beginning of the mark should be near the eyelashes.
Then you place under the eyelid cotton soaked in egg white or in psyllium seed mucilage.
Then you heat a cautery iron, this is its image:
Then cauterize on the shape that you marked, little by little, in many times until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is completely burned, especially its surface.
And the sign of the correctness of your work is that you see the eyelid has curled up and the hair has risen from the flesh of the eye, so lift your hand then and leave it for three days.
Then apply cotton with ghee on it until the eschar falls off, then treat it with the ointment until it heals, God willing.
If any of the hair returns after a while and the eyelid relaxes, repeat the cauterization on that place as you did first.
If the hair is on the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and the hair does not prick the eye.
As for cauterization with the burning medication, it is that you order the patient to leave the eyelashes until they grow long and even, then you make from paper the shape of a myrtle leaf, then take from the usual soap and from the quicklime, not slaked, of each one the weight of a dirham or so, and you grind them both well, and you do that quickly lest it dry, then you spread it on the paper that you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf and place it on the eyelid of one or both eyes, and you place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white, and the patient's head in your lap, and you place your index finger over the medication and press it slightly while moving it whenever the patient feels the sting of the medication, because he feels a sting like fire, so as long as he feels the sting, leave the medication and move it with your finger, and when the sting subsides, remove the medication and wash the eye with water and look. If you see the eyelid has risen as it rises when curling with fire or cutting, otherwise, reapply some of the medication on the area where the medication did not affect and did not blacken until you complete your work and the eye curls up, then place cotton with ghee on it until the burning scab falls off, then treat it with the palm ointment or another until it heals.
And it is necessary for you, when working, to be extremely careful that nothing of the medication falls into the eye.
If the eyelid relaxes after days and we fear something from the hair in the eye, reapply the medication on that area of the eyelid that relaxed, specifically as you did first, then treat it until it heals.
And this is a picture of a myrtle leaf:
And know that people's eyes may differ in smallness and largeness.
So according to that should be your rolling up (of the eyelids).
And the correct way is not hidden from one who has practice in this profession.
