Of the fracture of the kneecap	On setting a fracture of the patella of the knee.	0.5669037
Know that the kneecap rarely fractures, but it often dislocates. And if it fractures, it is usually just a crack or a small hole, and it happens both with and without a wound, and this is easily felt.	You should know that the patella is rarely fractured, but crushing often occurs. If a fracture does happen to it, it will be either a splitting or a shattering which may be simple or compound; and all these can be palpated.	0.81861556
And the restoration is such that what is round is set evenly with your fingers, until it is as closely joined as possible; then apply the poultice, and place a round splint, if needed, and bind it as necessary, then address all the conditions we mentioned in other fractures, such as hot abscesses and similar; and apply to each condition what is needed, until it is healed.	Now the way to set is for the separated parts of it to be put right with the fingers, so that they unite and join as far as straightening and gentleness and skill can serve. Then apply the plaster and put upon that a circular splint, if need be, and over that a suitable bandage. Then keep an eye on it for all the conditions described for the other fractures, such as an effusion and the like, meeting whatever arises with what is good for it, until it is healed.	0.84707767
