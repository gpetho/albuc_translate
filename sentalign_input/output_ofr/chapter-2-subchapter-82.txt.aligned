of ash tree Formice is a small, misshapen/irregular appearance around the body, and it goes very deep;	A pimple is also a little compact thick prominence on the skin surface, going deep; when it gets cold there is a feeling as of an ant's sting in it.	0.5548792
and sometimes the cold finds it, and it feels as if numb with cold, and it occurs all over the body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.	It is found all over the body but mostly on the hands.	0.47380063
And the treatment is that you take a quill from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place this quill upon the formice, so that the circle encompasses the formice all around; then turn your hand with the quill until you cut all around the formice, and put it in deep, and pull out the formice by its roots.	The treatment is to take the quill of a strong feather of the goose or the vulture, and place the quill over the pimple so as to encircle it with the circumference of the tube; then revolve the quill with your hand so as to cut all round the pimple, and go deep into the flesh, and then the pimple may be drawn out by the roots.	0.90633607
And if you wish, do this with a quill made of brass or iron according to this shape, and it should be thin underneath and sharp on top: not sharp enough to pierce, so that it can be held by the finger, and also pressed.	If you wish you may extract it with a tube of bronze or of iron, of this form. The upper closed part of the tube should be fine, solid, and twisted, to give easy purchase for the fingers in holding and revolving it.	0.6525501
And if you wish, cauterize the formice, as described earlier in the chapter on cautery.	If you wish you may cauterize the pimple as described earlier on the cauterization of warts in the book on the cautery.	0.7403823
