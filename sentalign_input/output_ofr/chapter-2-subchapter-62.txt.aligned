of fleshy hernia A watery hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture or white hydrocele, which is below the covering of the testicles that contains the testicle; and it is called "hydrocele", and sometimes it is specifically in the membrane of the testicle, so that one thinks it is another testicle; and it is the skin of the scrotum between the white hydrocele that we have mentioned; and this does not occur except rarely.	A watery hernia is a collection of fluid in the white membrane lying beneath the skin surrounding the testicle, which is called the scrotum. Sometimes it has a capsule of its own which nature has formed alongside the testis so that one would think it another testicle; it may also form between the skin of the scrotum and the white membrane which we mentioned; however, this occurs very rarely.	0.83374465
And the cause of this hernia is a weakness that comes to the testicles, and this matter is spread.	This hernia arises from a weakness occurring in the testicles and this matter drains into it; sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles.	0.6335761
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: either it is a color tending towards jaundice, or it is blood red, or black, or watery white, and this occurs more often; and these are the signs to recognize this collection, for if it is in the white hydrocele that we have mentioned, then the abscess is round, a little long like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear, because there is moisture all around it.	The fluid is of different colours, sometimes yellowish, sometimes blood-red, sometimes like lees, black, and sometimes the fluid is watery-pale; this actually is the commonest. Now these are the signs whereby we know where the fluid is collecting: if it be in the tunica albugínea, as we have said, the tumour will be round and slightly elongated like the shape of an egg. The testis is not apparent since the fluid hems it in all round.	0.8412947
And if there is moisture in the membrane itself, then the abscess is round along with a part of the testicle, and therefore one thinks that it is another testicle; and if the moisture is between the skin of the scrotum and the white hydrocele, then one feels it well; therefore when you want to know the color of the moisture, test it with the square probe, whose form is shown above. According to what then comes out after the probe, judge what is inside.	The testis is not apparent since the fluid hems it in all round. But if the fluid be contained in a capsule of its own the tumour will be round, to one side of the testicle; therefore one imagines that it is another testicle. If the fluid be situated between the skin of the scrotum and the tunica albugínea it will be obvious to the touch. If you wish to know the colour of the fluid, take a sample from the tumour by means of the four-sided exploring needle which has been figured previously; and by what comes out in the track of the explorer you may know the colour of the contained fluid.	0.82987773
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another disease, you must tie the spermatic cord which suspends it, fearing the flow of blood; then cut the testicle along with the spermatic cord, and remove the testicle, and treat it as we have said.	If you find the testicle corrupted by some other disease, you will have to tie off the vessels which are in the suspensor, for fear of haemorrhage. Then cut the testicle from the suspensor and remove it and dress as we said above.	0.85041964
And if fluid is collected in two parts together, know that these are two branches; cut the other part as you did the first, equally, then wipe the blood and put wool soaked in rose oil in the wound; and above put other wool soaked in wine and oil, and place it over both testicles, and put doubled cloths on top, and tie it up with the bandage which is according to this form: Then take two cloths, and fill them with carded wool according to this likeness and join them by stitching at the opening of the pants, and one of the ends should go over the buttocks up to the back, and the other to the area of the penis; and the other two ends over the two groins, and let all the tightening be gathered in the buckle of the pants; and sometimes this branch is treated with a cautery instead of a cutting iron, and that is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the scrotum, and it should be heated as we have said, so that the white hydrocele which contains the water is uncovered; then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce this hydrocele with the hooks, and peel it with this thin, hot cautery:	If the accumulation of fluid be on both sides you may know it to be a double hydrocele; so make another incision on the other side as you did for the first. If it is convenient for you to make one operation of it, do so. Then wipe away the blood and apply to the incisions wool that has been soaked in olive-oil or oil of roses and on that again more wool that has been soaked in wine and oil, and spread that over the testicles and over the hypogastrium; and over that again folded pieces of linen forming pads and bind them down with a bandage having six heads. Two pieces of cloth should be taken and sewn together and packed in between with carded wool to this pattern.	0.8741933
And cut it in all the ways you can, until you remove everything; and be careful that the fire does not touch the testicle; and know that this work is safer, and less prone to bleeding, and gentler than the work of cutting; and if anything opposes you, either a hot abscess or bleeding or something else, then treat what opposes you, according to what has been said before.	But be careful that the heat do not touch the testicle. You should know that this operation is safer, further removed from the danger of haemorrhage, and better, than operation by incision. If, while operating either with the knife or the cautery, you are hindered by an inflammatory swelling or haemorrhage or anything else, you should deal with all of them by suitable treatment in accordance with what has been said before. If the patient be timid and will not suffer this operation on account of its unpleasantness, then treat by perforation as I shall now describe.	0.7658671
