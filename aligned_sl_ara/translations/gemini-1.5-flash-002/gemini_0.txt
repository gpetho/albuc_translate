The author of this book says: When I have completed for you, O my sons, this book, which is a part of the science of medicine in its entirety, and have reached the limit of its clarity and explanation, I saw that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the practical work.
Because practical work is completely lacking in our country and in our time, so much so that its knowledge is almost extinct and its effect has ceased. And only a few outlines of it remain in the books of the ancients, which have been copied by hands and marred by mistakes and confusion, until its meanings have become obscure and its usefulness distant.
Therefore I saw fit to revive it and to compose this treatise on it in the way of explanation, clarification, and brevity, and to present pictures of cauterizing irons and other surgical instruments, since this is an aid to explanation and a guarantee of what is needed.
The reason why there is no skilled craftsman in our time is that the craft of medicine is lengthy, and its practitioner must first practice in the science of anatomy, which Galen described. until he understands the functions, forms, temperaments, connections, and separations of the organs, and the knowledge of the bones, nerves, muscles, their number, origins, the pulsating and non-pulsating vessels, and the locations of their origins.
Therefore Hippocrates said that physicians in name are many, but in deed few, especially in the craft of surgery, and we have mentioned a part of this in the introduction to this book.
For he who is not knowledgeable in what we have mentioned of anatomy will inevitably fall into error, killing people thereby, as I have often witnessed in those who imagined themselves skilled in this science and claimed it without knowledge or expertise.
And that is because I saw an ignorant physician who incised a pig-like tumor in a woman's neck, and severed some of the neck's arteries, so the woman bled until she fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who proceeded to remove a stone from a man who had a fistula, and the stone was large, so he was reckless and removed it with a piece of the bladder substance. So the man died after about three days, and I had been summoned to remove it, and I saw from the size of the stone and the state of the patient that I could have assessed it.
And I saw another physician who earned his living practicing medicine with some of the brothel keepers of our city.
Then it happened to a black boy who had a fracture in his leg near the heel with a wound, and the physician, in his ignorance, hastened and bound the fracture over the wound with bandages and splints very tightly, and did not leave room for the wound to breathe.
Then he indulged his desires, then left him for days and ordered him not to untie the bandage until his leg and foot swelled and he was near death.
Then I was summoned to him, so I hastened to untie the bandage, and he found relief and was freed from his pains, except that the corruption had become entrenched in the limb and I could not prevent it.
Then the corruption continued to spread in the limb until he died.
And I saw another physician cauterize a cancerous tumor, and it ulcerated after days until the suffering of its owner greatly increased. That is because if the cancer is purely of black humor, then it should not be treated with iron at all.
Unless it is in a limb that can be entirely excised.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual operations are divided into two parts: an operation accompanied by safety, and an operation accompanied by harm in most cases.
And I have warned in every place in this book where this comes up about operations which are risky and dangerous, and you should therefore avoid and reject them.
Lest the ignorant find a way to criticize and attack, therefore take caution and circumspection for yourselves, and gentleness and deliberation for your patients.
And use the best method leading to safety and a favorable outcome, and avoid dangerous and difficult-to-cure diseases.
And keep yourselves clear from what you fear might cast doubt upon your religion and your worldly life; for this is more lasting for your reputation and higher for your status in this world and the next.
For Galen said in some of his precepts: Do not treat a bad disease, lest you become a bad physician.
This chapter has been divided into three sections.
The first section.
On cauterization with fire and with strong medicine, methodically ordered from head to foot, with illustrations of the instruments and cautery irons, and everything needed for the work by hand.
And the second section.
On incision, puncture, bloodletting, cupping, wounds, and the extraction of arrows and the like, all methodically ordered, with illustrations of the instruments.
And the third section.
On setting, reduction, and the treatment of dislocations and the like, methodically ordered from head to foot, with illustrations of the instruments.
The first section.
On cautery.
And before we mention its use, it is necessary to mention its benefits and harms, and in what temperament it is used.
And I say that discussion of the benefits and harms of cautery is lengthy, a precise science, and a hidden secret, and a number of wise men have spoken of it.
And they differed in it, and I have shortened their words for fear of lengthening.
And I say that cautery generally benefits every bad temperament that is with a material thing and without a material thing, except for two temperaments: the hot temperament without a material thing and the dry temperament without a material thing.
As for the dry temperament with a material thing, they differed concerning it. Some said that cautery is beneficial in it, and others said the opposite, that cautery is not suitable for a disease that is from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
And it is impossible to cure a hot, dry disease with a hot, dry medicine. And he who says the opposite says that cautery with fire may benefit from a hot, dry disease that occurs in the bodies of people. Because when you add the body of man and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you affect the body of man with coldness.
And I say as he says, because experience has revealed that to me many times, except that one should not imagine that matter except one who has trained and practiced in the matter of cautery to a great extent. And he has observed the differences in the temperaments of people and the state of diseases in themselves, their causes, their symptoms, and their duration.
But as for the other temperaments, there is no fear for you from them, especially cold, moist diseases; all the physicians have agreed on them and have not differed in the benefit of cautery in them.
And know, O my son, that among the secrets of cautery with fire and its superiority to cautery with a burning medicine is that fire is a simple element whose effect does not exceed the member which is cauterized, and it does not harm another member connected to it except slightly.
And cautery with a burning medicine may extend its effect to other members, and it may cause a disease in the member which is difficult to treat, and it may even kill.  Fire, because of its nobility and the excellence of its essence, does not do that except if one overdoes it.
And this has become clear to us through experience, long service, attention to the craft, and understanding the realities of the matter.
Therefore, I have dispensed with lengthy discussion. If it were not unbecoming of this book of mine, I would have presented to you concerning fire a hidden secret and the manner of its action in bodies and its expulsion of diseases with philosophical, demonstrative discourse too subtle for your understanding.
And know, O my sons, that they have differed concerning the time suitable for cautery, and they have considered the best time to be springtime.
And I say that cautery is suitable at any time, because the harm caused by the time is consumed by the benefit which is brought about by cautery. Especially if the cautery is for strong, urgent, necessary pains which do not tolerate delay, because of what is feared from them, that a calamity might follow which is greater than the slight harm arising from the time.
And let it not occur to you, O my sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that cautery which cures a certain disease will never return, and they make it a reproach.
And the matter is not as they suppose, because cautery is only like a medicine which changes the temperament and dries the humors which are the cause of the pains.
Except that cautery is preferable to medicine in the speed of its success, the strength of its action, and the intensity of its power.
And it is possible that the disease may return after a time, according to the temperament of the patient, the strength of his disease, and what is prepared in his body of an accumulation of humors, and his negligence in acquiring them from foods and the like of causes.
Except that the disease in which cautery is used is a mild disease and in a member with few humors and moistures. Like cauterizing a tooth for pain and the like; for it is possible that that pain may not return, and that is the least.
And as for the common people's saying also that cautery is the last of medicine, it is a true saying, not to what they go to, for they believe that no treatment benefits with medicine or otherwise after the occurrence of cautery, and the matter is contrary to that.
And the meaning of cautery being the last of medicine is only that when we use types of treatment in a disease and those medicines do not work, then we use the last thing, cautery, and it works; from here it happened that cautery is the last of medicine. Not in the meaning to which the common people and many ignorant physicians went.
The ancients mentioned that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they said that because of the moderation of gold and the nobility of its essence, and they said that the place of cauterization does not suppurate; and that is not absolutely so.
Because I have tried that and found that it only does that in some bodies and not others, and cauterization with it is better and more excellent than iron, as they said; except that if you heat the cautery iron in the fire, made of gold, you will not know when it is heated to the degree you want, due to the redness of the gold.
And because cold quickly affects it, and if you increase the heat on it, it melts in the fire and is spoiled, and the artisan falls into trouble because of that; therefore, cauterization with iron is, for us, quicker and closer to correctness in practice, God willing.
And I have arranged this chapter on cauterization into sections which I have organized from head to foot, to make it easier for the student what he wants from it, God willing.
The first section.
On cauterizing the head, one cauterization.
This cauterization benefits from the predominance of moisture and cold on the brain, which are the cause of headache and frequent colds from the head to the area of the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, and toothache and throat pain. And in short, for every illness that arises from cold, such as paralysis, epilepsy, aphasia and similar illnesses.
The method of this cauterization is that you first order the patient to vomit with a purgative medicine that cleanses the head for three or four nights, depending on the strength of the patient, his age, and his habit.
Then you order him to shave his head with a razor, then you seat him before you cross-legged, having placed his hands on his chest.
Then you place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes; where your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-shaped cautery, which is of this form.
If the bone is exposed to the extent of the head of a toothpick or the size of a carob seed, lift your hand; otherwise, reapply your hand with the same instrument or another if it has cooled. Until you see of the bone what I mentioned to you. Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, soak a cotton swab in it, place it on the spot, and leave it for three days.
Then apply a cotton swab soaked in butter to it and leave it there until the eschar from the cautery falls away. Then treat it with the quaternary ointment until it heals, God willing.
And they have said that the longer a wound remains open, the more pus it discharges, and this is better and more beneficial.
Some have mentioned cauterizing the skin to the bone, holding the cautery until some of the thickness of the bone is burned, then removing what was burned from the bone, and then treating it.
Others said it is necessary to exaggerate with the cautery so that it strongly affects the bone, until it falls from the bone in the shape of a carat or small flake. They claimed that this vents the vapors of the head from that spot, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then it is treated until it heals. I do not see these two types of cautery at all except in some people and in a haphazard way.  In my opinion, leaving it untreated is better, and if it is done, it is safer, for the head weakens when its natural connection is broken, as we have seen in other members.
Especially if the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it, so use it and you will be safe, God willing.
Chapter Two.
Also on cauterizing the head.
If a chronic pain occurs in the head and it persists in the patient, and applications, collyria, snuffs, ointments, and dressings have been used, especially if a single cauterization, as we have described, has been performed without benefit, then look. If the patient's head is naturally strong and not weak, and he feels intense cold, cauterize it again a little above the previous cauterization. Then cauterize each temple of his head until the thickness of the skin is gone and the amount of bone we described is exposed. And cauterize him in the back of his head in the place known as the hatchet, and lighten your hand in this, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will feel severe pain from this unlike the pain of all other cauterizations of the head, and I will mention this cauterization in its place.
And the cautery with which the temples and the back of the head are cauterized should be gentler than the cautery with which the middle of the head is cauterized, and this is its image.
Chapter Three.
On cauterizing non-chronic migraine.
If pain occurs in a fissure of the head along with headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then let the patient vomit with head-purifying medicines and use all the treatments I mentioned in the sections on illnesses; if that does not work, then cauterization is done in two ways. Either cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine or with iron.
As for cauterization with a burning medicine, take a single clove of garlic, peel it, and cut its ends from both sides, then incise the painful area of the temple with a wide scalpel until there is a space under the skin large enough for the clove.
Then insert it under the skin until it disappears, then bind it tightly with bandages, and leave it for about fifteen hours, then unbind it, remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, then dress it.
Dress it with cotton soaked in butter until the area suppurates, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. And if you wish, do this with some of the burning medicines which I mentioned in the eighteenth chapter on burning medicines.
As for cauterization with iron, it is in this manner: heat the cautery iron, which is pictured thus:
And it is called the nail cautery because its head is like the head of a nail, with some perforations and a small projection in the middle.
Then place it on the painful area and hold your hand while you rotate the cautery iron little by little, and the amount you burn should be about half the thickness of the skin. And lift your hand so that you do not burn the artery underneath and cause bleeding, then soak cotton in salt water and apply it to the area and leave it for three days. Then dress the cotton with ointment and then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize this headache with the knife-like end of the cautery iron, and be careful not to cut the artery in this chronic headache especially.
Chapter Four.
Cauterization of the chronic headache.
If you treat the headache with what we have mentioned of the preceding treatment and what we mentioned in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment is not effective, and you see a cause for which what we mentioned of the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire is not sufficient. Then it is necessary that you heat the knife-like cautery iron until it glows white, after you have marked on the place of the pain a line the length of half a finger or thereabouts, and you leave your hand for one moment while you pull it so that you sever the artery and reach towards the bone.
Except that it is necessary for you to be cautious of the contact of the jaw which moves during mastication, lest you burn the muscle or the nerve which moves it, and so cause tetanus.
And be cautious and watchful of the bleeding of the artery which you have cut, for there is danger in its being cut. Especially for one who is ignorant of what he is doing and has not been a trained and experienced person; and to leave the work is better.
And the treatment of accidental bleeding from the artery will be mentioned in its proper place in the book, God willing; if you see from the condition something which this cauterization does not overcome.
And you saw the body of the patient able to tolerate it, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, use the cautery which we mentioned in the chapter on the opening of the artery with the knife-cautery, for it is a better and more effective cautery than this.
Chapter Five.
In cauterizing the pains of the ears.
If pain occurs in the ear due to cold and it is treated with laxatives and other treatments which we mentioned in the classification, and the pain does not go away, then heat the cautery which is called the point, whose image is this.
Then, after heating it, prick with it around the whole ear, as it goes around, or around both if the pain is in both. And keep the cauterization a little distance from the root of the ear, after marking the place with ink. The cauterization should be about ten points in each ear, or thereabouts. Then treat the places until they heal, God willing.
Chapter Six.
Cauterization of Paralysis.
The paralysis treated by cauterization is that type which arises from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classifications of diseases.
And one should avoid cauterizing the type which arises from dryness and spasm of the nerve.
When you have treated this type of paralysis with plasters, snuffs, and gargles and your treatment has been ineffective, then the patient should be cauterized with three cauterizations. One at the base of the ear, the second a little below his temple, and the third at the junction of the lips.
And make your cauterization on the opposite side from the diseased side, because the relaxation occurs on the side which appears healthy.
And the image of the cauterization is that you cauterize with a cauterization opposite the upper tip of the ear, a little below the horn of the head, and another in the temple, and its length should be the length of the thumb.
Lower your hand with the cautery until you burn about half the thickness of the skin.  This is the image of the cautery; it is a type of scalpel, the image of which has preceded, but it is a little gentler, as you see. The scalpel should be a little thicker than usual, then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
Cauterization of chronic apoplexy.
If the apoplexy becomes chronic and you treat it with what we have mentioned, and your treatment is not effective, and the patient does not have a fever, cauterize him in four places. One cauterization on each temple, one in the middle of the head as previously mentioned, and one at the back of the head as before.
The application of the cautery is as previously described.  A cauterization may also be applied to the pit of the stomach, which will be more effective, then treat as before.
Chapter Eight.
On cauterization for forgetfulness.
If it is caused by phlegm, the patient should first be given strong purgatives and brain-cleansing pills.
Then his whole head should be shaved and a mustard plaster, as described in the chapter on plasters, should be applied to the back of his head several times, for this is a kind of cauterization.
Do this in the same manner as I have described there; if he is cured by that, well and good; otherwise, cauterize him three times at the back of his head, in a row from the top of the head to the nape of the neck.
Make the distance between each cauterization the width of a finger.  Then treat the cauterization as described above. If you wish to increase [the treatment] and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle area.
If you wish to increase [the treatment], cauterize the temples, then treat it until it heals. The cautery should be olive-shaped, as previously described.
Chapter Nine.
On cauterizing paralysis and general body relaxation.
It is necessary that you begin by purifying the head with purgatives and as we have mentioned. Then shave the patient's head, then cauterize: one cauterization in the middle of the head, one on each temple, and one on the back of the head.
And three on the vertebrae of the neck. If, in the case of relaxation of the body, you need more than that, and the patient can tolerate it and the disease is strong and persistent, then cauterize with four cauterizations on the vertebrae of his back. Cauterize until you burn most of the skin, then lift your hand, and then treat him as previously mentioned until he is healed, God willing.  The cautery should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Ten.
On cauterizing epilepsy.
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is due to phlegm is cauterized.  It is necessary to first cleanse his brain with strong purgatives and with all the other treatments we mentioned in the classification, if the patient is an adult and able to take medication.
But if he is a child who cannot tolerate medication, then use gargles and masticatories that cleanse the brain for many days beforehand, along with improving his diet.
Then his head is shaved, then one cauterization is performed in the middle of the head as described before, and another at the back. And one cauterization on each temple. If the patient is strong and able to withstand it, perform the cauterizations described for the patient with paralysis and bodily relaxation, on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back; and the cautery should be olive-shaped, as described previously.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery mild in this manner.
Chapter Eleven.
On cauterizing melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, perform the cauterizations that we mentioned for the patient with paralysis.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess tending towards black bile and the patient's body is moist, purge what cleanses his brain as was previously mentioned in the classification.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tightly woven linen cake in the shape of a circle, then place it in the middle of his head while the patient sits cross-legged holding it on all sides, then take one pound of old sheep tallow.
Then heat it over a fire to a moderate temperature, as much as the finger can withstand when inserted, then pour it into the middle of his head inside the circle and leave it until it cools.  Do this for the patient once every week along with other good treatments until he is cured, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize it with many small punctures, without holding the cautery iron, but rather by applying it lightly; for this type of cautery moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply a cotton wool pad soaked in tallow or chicken fat.
Chapter Twelve.
On cauterizing the watery discharge in the eye.
If the watery discharge in the eye becomes apparent to you through the signs I mentioned in the classification, then act quickly, and purge the patient of what pollutes his head and purify him of all humors, and sweat him in the bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave his head and cauterize in the middle of the head, then cauterize twice on the temples if the onset of the watery discharge is in both eyes, or on one side if it is in one eye.
Then cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin, and let the cauterizations be lengthwise across the temples, and safeguard against bleeding.
If you see something of it, cut it off immediately with whatever treatment is possible for you.  And we shall come to the wisdom in cauterizing and cutting the arteries and safeguarding against bleeding.
And it may be cauterized at the nape of the neck below the two bones with two deep cauterizations.
Chapter Thirteen.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic tears.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and persistent, and are from the veins and arteries on the surface of the head, from outside the head, and you are certain that it is from cold, thick, phlegmatic superfluities, then cauterize it with the cauterization which I described in the beginning of the section on epiphora. A cauterization in the middle of the head, and two cauterizations on the temples, and two cauterizations at the nape of the neck below the two bones. And if you need to increase [the treatment], then cauterize one cauterization on each side of the tail of the eye at the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery iron.
Chapter Fourteen.
Concerning the cauterization of a foul-smelling nose.
If you treat it with what we mentioned in the classification and the treatment is not effective, then quickly purge the patient with colocynth for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the middle with an olive-shaped cautery iron. Then cauterize with the nail-shaped cautery iron, two cauterizations above the eyebrows, slightly below the hair, and be careful of the artery, do not cut it. And this is the image of the nail-shaped [cautery iron].
Chapter Fifteen.
Concerning the cauterization of a relaxed eyelid.
If an eyelid becomes relaxed due to illness or moisture, cauterize the eyelid with one cauterization using this crescent-shaped cautery iron.
And if you wish, cauterize a little above the eyebrows, two cauterizations on each side, and keep them distant from the temples, and let the length of each cauterization be the length of the eyebrow.
And do not exaggerate with the cauterization, but only to the extent that one-third of the skin is burned, and the shape of the cautery iron is like this.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If its margins are inverted inwards so that the eye is injured, then cauterization is of two types. Either cauterization with fire or cauterization with a burning medicine. As for cauterization with fire, you should order the patient beforehand to leave his eyelids alone, if he is one who plucks them, until they grow long and even.
If he plucks them while they are growing, then bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they grow.  When they have grown and become even, place the patient's head in your lap, then mark the eyelid with ink, a mark in the shape of an aspen leaf.
The beginning of the mark should be near the margins. Then place under the eyelid cotton soaked in egg white or in the saliva of a lizard. Then heat a cautery iron, its shape is this.
Then cauterize according to the mark you made, little by little, many times, until the surface of the skin, which is in the shape of the aspen leaf, is entirely burned, especially its surface. A sign of the correctness of your work is that you see the eyelid curled and the hair raised from the flesh of the eye.
Then lift your hand and leave it for three days, then apply cotton with butter to it until the scab comes off, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If some of the hair returns after a time and the eyelid relaxes,
repeat the cauterization in that place as you did before. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and does not prick the eye. As for cauterization with a burning medicine, it is that you instruct the patient to leave the margins until they grow long and even.
Then make from paper the shape of an aspen leaf. Then take of the usual soap and of unslaked lime, of each one a drachm weight or so. Crush them both together well and do this quickly lest it dry. Then spread some of it on the paper which you made in the shape of an aspen leaf and place it on one or both eyelids. Place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white, and the patient's head in your lap.
And place your index finger on top of the medicine and press it slightly, moving it whenever the patient feels the sting of the medicine, for he will feel a burning sensation. As long as he feels the burning, leave the medicine and move it with your finger. When the burning ceases, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And look; if you see that the eyelid has risen as it rises when cauterized with fire or with cutting, then do otherwise.  Repeat applying the medicine to the place where the medicine did not take effect and did not blacken, until you complete your work and the eyelid is cauterized. Then place cotton with fat on it until the burning subsides.
Then treat it with palm ointment or another until it heals.  It is necessary for you during the procedure to be extremely careful that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye. If the eyelid relaxes after some days and something like hair is suspected in the eye.
Then reapply the medicine to that place of the eyelid which has relaxed, specifically as you did before, then treat it until it heals. This is the image of the aspen leaf.
Know that people's eyes differ in size, so let your cauterization be according to that. The correct way is not hidden from one who has experience in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cauterizing the ulcer that appears in the canthus of the eye.
If you treat the ulcer with what we mentioned in the divisions of diseases and your treatment is not effective, then it should be cauterized in this manner.
Order the patient to place his head in your lap, and let a servant hold his head in front of you in such a way that he does not move or shake his head.
Then place a cotton ball moistened with egg white or the saliva of a frog on his eyes, then heat the cautery which is of this shape.
It should be hollow like the quill of an eagle's feather on the one side which is used for cauterization, and if you wish it may be perforated on the other end, and if you wish it may be solid like a nail, except that the hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then squeeze the fistula if it is open and remove its contents and dry it, or if it is not open, open it and remove its pus; then place the cautery on it while it is very hot, holding it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
And move your hand a little away from the eye towards the nose during cauterization, lest your hand slip or the patient become restless and the cautery fall into the eyelid and damage it. If you reach the bone with the first cauterization, well and good; otherwise, repeat the cauterization a second time if needed.
Leave it for three days, then apply a cotton ball with butter and treat it with drying ointment until it heals. If forty days pass and it does not heal, apply a strong, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and remove it as will be mentioned in its chapter, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing a fistula, mentioned by some of the ancients: you aim at the location of the fistula, incise it, then place in the incision a thin cone, its image is as follows.
Pour into it the amount of one dirham of molten lead, and hold your hand on the cone firmly, clamped down, and the patient must not move at all, lest the molten lead flow into his eye.  It is advisable to place on the patient's eye a cotton ball moistened with egg white or water.
For the lead will burn the fistula and heal it wonderfully. If the fistula heals by the cauterization and treatment mentioned, well and good; otherwise, it is necessary to use the perforation of the nose and return the fistula to the nasal passage, as will be explained in its specific place.
Chapter Eighteen.
On cauterizing fissures of the lip.
Fissures often occur in the lip, called sha`rah, especially in the lips of children; it occurs frequently. If you treat this fissure with what we mentioned in the section and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small, knife-like cautery of this form.
Its hollow should be like the edge of a knife, then apply it, heated quickly, into the fissure itself until the cauterization reaches the depth of the fissure, then treat it with kyrotos until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
On cauterizing fistulas occurring in the mouth.
If a swelling appears at the root of the gums, or in the palate, or at the roots of the molars, then it suppurates and bursts, and from the running pus a fistula results, then if you treat it and the treatment is not effective, it is necessary to heat a cautery to the extent that it fits into the fistula.
Then insert it, heated, into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and end.  Do this once or twice, then treat it afterwards with what we have mentioned of treatments until it heals, God willing.
If the matter ceases and it heals, well and good; otherwise, it is necessary to examine the place and remove the decayed bone, according to what will come in its chapter, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On cauterizing loose molars and gums.
If the gums are relaxed due to moisture and the molars move, and you have treated them with medication but it has not worked, then place the patient's head in your lap, then heat the cautery iron, whose image comes after this, after you have placed the tube on the tooth.
And quickly insert the hot cautery iron into it, and hold your hand for a short time until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth, then raise your hand, then repeat the cautery iron several times as you wish, then the patient fills his mouth with salt water.
And he holds it for an hour and then spits it out; for the loose tooth becomes firm, and the relaxed gum tightens, and the foul moisture dries.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In cauterizing toothache.
If the toothache is from cold, or if there are worms in it, and treatment with medication is ineffective, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with fat, or cauterization with fire.
As for cauterization with fat, you take cow's fat and boil it in an iron spoon or in a shell, then you take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe, then dip it in the boiled fat and quickly place it on the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools.
Then repeat it several times until the strength of the heat reaches the root of the tooth. And if you wish, you can dip wool or cotton in cold fat and place it on the aching tooth, and place the heated iron on top of it until the heat reaches the bottom of the tooth.
As for cauterization with fire, you take a copper or iron tube, and it should be somewhat thick in its body, lest the heat of the fire reach the patient's mouth. Then heat the cautery iron which is depicted, and place it on the tooth itself, and hold your hand until the cautery iron cools. Do this several times.
Then the pain will go away, either that same day or the next day. After the cauterization, the patient should fill his mouth with good fat and hold it for an hour, then spit it out. This is the image of the cautery iron.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish, and as much as possible. This is the image of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-two.
On cauterizing fistulas.
If the fistulas are caused by phlegm and cold humors and do not respond to ripening medications, and you desire rapid ripening, then heat a hollow cautery iron, which is depicted here, perforated at both ends.
So that the smoke exits at the other end during cauterization. Place it gently on the tumor itself, once or twice if necessary, until you reach the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, make the cautery iron proportional to the size of the tumor.
Then leave it for three days and apply cotton soaked in butter to it until what was burned by fire is removed. Then treat it with ointment and lint until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
On cauterization for hoarseness and shortness of breath.
If humors prevail over the windpipe, especially if it is accompanied by coldness of temperament, then the patient should first be purged with laxative medicines, then cauterize with a cautery iron in the hollow of the throat at the base of the gullet in the lower part.
Be careful not to reach the gullet with the cautery and do not burn more than half of the skin. Then apply another cautery at the joint of the neck at the end of its last vertebra, and let the cautery iron be nail-shaped in the manner previously described.
Then treat him with what has been mentioned until he is cured, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On cauterizing lung disease and cough.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold humors, and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the disease is chronic, then apply two cauteries above the clavicles in the low, soft, empty places, and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
And the cautery should be nail-shaped, in the manner previously described.  And if you wish, let your cauterization be punctate with the cautery called the point, the image of which has been previously shown in puncturing earache; and let the points number from thirty or thereabouts.
Then treat him with what has been previously mentioned until he recovers. You may also make a cautery with three branches, in this manner, and hasten the cauterization with it, because you cauterize three places at once with it. This is the image of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
In cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus is dislocated because of slippery humors, or if it does not remain in place when it is reduced from its dislocation so that this becomes a habit, then it is dislocated at the slightest movement as we have witnessed, then it is necessary to reduce the joint first. Then the patient lies on his back or on the healthy side, then the skin inside the armpit is raised upwards with the fingers of your left hand if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then heat the cautery iron with two points, the image of which is this.
Then cauterize the skin with it until it penetrates to the other side, and the shape of the cautery is four cauterizations.  It may be cauterized with a cautery iron with three points, in which case the shape of the cauterization will then be six cauterizations, and the points will be on the thinness of the rose.
And this is the image of the cautery iron with three points.
And this number may be increased by one, making eight cauterizations. Then, the pounded balls with salt are applied to the cauterization, then the patient is kept quiet and does not move the limb for a time until it strengthens. And if the dislocation is upwards, and this is rarely the case.
Then cauterize above the shoulder, one good nail-shaped cauterization, or many cauterizations by puncturing; for the joint becomes firm, and the moisture departs, and the patient is healed.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In cauterizing the stomach.
If there occurs in the stomach coldness and much moisture, to the extent that it removes it from its temperament and there are many catarrhs to it, and it is treated with various treatments but they are not effective, then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back and extend his legs and hands, then cauterize with three cauterizations. One cauterization below the clavicle, the size of a finger, with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauterizations below on the sides of the one cauterization, so that the shape of the cauterizations is triangular, and further apart from each other lest they unite if they suppurate; and the depth of the cauterization should be two-thirds the thickness of the skin, and that should be the shape of the cauterizations.
In this manner and to this extent, no more.
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cauterization in the middle of the stomach in this manner.
And the cautery with which you cauterize this single cauterization should be in the shape of a circle, in this manner.
And the stomach may be cauterized by puncturing for whomever is apprehensive of this cauterization; and that is that you mark points on the stomach to the extent that you wish with ink, then cauterize them with a punctate cautery, then treat it with the treatment that has preceded until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On the cold cauterization of the liver.
If there arises from the liver pain due to coldness and dampness, or due to a subtle wind, so that it has departed from its natural temperament excessively, and the patient has been treated with what we mentioned in the division, and that has not availed, Then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, and three cauterizations should be marked with ink in this form and this exact amount on the liver, below the diaphragm, where the elbow of a person ends.
And after each cauterization, there should be a cauterization of the thickness of a finger, and the cauterization should be along the body, straight; and do not press down firmly with the cautery.
Let the amount of thickness of skin that is burned be about half, no more.  And let the patient stand on his feet; and if he is not standing, then let him be lying down with his legs extended and his arms raised. And this is the image of the cautery.
And you may be able to cauterize these cauterizations with the knife-cautery if you have gentleness and skill in the craft, and be cautious lest you overdo the cauterization, burning all the skin, burning the abdomen and reaching the intestines, for the skin there is thin; so know this.
Chapter twenty-eight.
In cauterizing a swelling of the liver.
If an abscess appears in the liver, and you wish to know if that swelling is in the flesh of the liver or in its peritoneum, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient will find heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the peritoneum of the liver, there will be intense sharpness with the pain, and you see that the physicians have been unable to treat it, then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, then you should mark the swollen area with ink.
Then heat the cautery in the fire; it is the cautery that resembles a needle, and this is its image. And cauterize it with one cauterization until you burn all the skin and the cauterization reaches the peritoneum until all the matter comes out, then treat it with the treatment of abscesses until it heals.
And this type of cauterization should not be used except by one whose training in the art of medicine has been long and who has experienced these diseases repeatedly; then he may undertake such work, but leaving it is better in my opinion.
Chapter twenty-nine.
On cauterizing the fistula.
The ancients mentioned cauterization with the roots of rhubarb for a cold fistula in this manner: that you take one long, dry root of rhubarb, the longest you can find, and it should be about the thickness of a finger, then dip it in oil and heat it in the fire. Then cauterize with one cauterization between the juncture of the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauterizations slightly below the nape of the neck, inclined toward the side under the chin, and two large cauterizations above the breasts between the third and fourth ribs.
And two cauterizations also between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly inclined backward, and another cauterization in the middle of the chest and another above the stomach, and three cauterizations from behind: one between the shoulders and two on the sides of the spine, lower than the cauterization which is between the shoulders.
And you should not deepen your hand with the cautery, but it should be a superficial cauterization of the skin.  Some of the ancients mentioned that some people used an iron cautery like a spatula; they would heat it and insert it between the ribs until it reached the tumor itself.
And it expels the matter, as we mentioned in the tumor of the liver. And in this method of cauterization there is great danger; either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops at the site which will not heal.
Chapter Thirty.
On cauterizing the spleen.
If you treat the disease of the spleen with the treatments mentioned in the section and your treatment is not effective, then cauterization is done in three ways, all of which are correct. One is to cauterize it with three or four cauterizations aligned along the length of the spleen.
In the form of the liver cauterizations whose form we have described previously, and between each cauterization and the next should be the width of a finger or slightly more. The nature of the cautery should be as we described in cauterizing the liver, and do not deepen your hand in the cauterization. The patient's position is lying on his back.
And the other method is in the flank, and you lift the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left flank ends, and you lift the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left flank ends, and your lifting of the skin should be across the body so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body.
Then you insert the two cautery irons very carefully until you pass them through the skin on the other side, then you remove the cautery irons, so that the cauterizations are four. And if you wish, you may cauterize with the other cautery iron with three points.
Then you treat the site of the cauterization after you leave it to drain pus for many days; this is more effective than all the previously mentioned treatments.
Chapter thirty-one.
On cauterizing dropsy.
Cauterization is only beneficial in ascitic dropsy specifically. If you treat the dropsical patient with the types of treatment which we mentioned in the classification, and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize him with four cauterizations around the navel and one cauterization on the stomach.
Another cauterization on the liver, a cauterization on the spleen, and two cauterizations on his back between the vertebrae—one opposite his chest and another opposite his stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be approximately the thickness of the skin. Then you leave the cauterization open to drain pus for a long time.
And do not neglect the patient after cauterization with what is necessary to combine the two benefits for him, so that healing will be hastened. The shape of the cautery iron with which the back is cauterized is nail-shaped, as its image has preceded.  That with which the abdomen is cauterized is olive-shaped.
Chapter thirty-two.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If they swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, then it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the depression between the little finger and the ring finger.
And place your hand with the cautery iron and do not bend it, then raise your hand and do not return it at all, for the yellow water will ooze out, and the cautery iron is of this shape.
Then cauterize on the legs, two cauterizations on each leg, and the cauterization should be with the sharp end of the cautery iron, and the cauterization should be along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another below it towards the middle of the leg, and on each thigh, two cauterizations.
And leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time, so that the water oozes out, then treat it with all that we have mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On cauterizing diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is from cold and moisture, so that it weakens the retaining and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and this has been treated with various treatments and it has not healed, and you see the patient able to tolerate cauterization and strong, then cauterize him with a large cauterization on his stomach. As was previously mentioned in cauterizing the stomach with the circular cautery iron and four cauterizations around the navel with a gentle, nail-like cautery iron, and a large cauterization on the cotton above the coccyx, or two cauterizations.
If you see the moisture abundant and the patient able to tolerate it, then cauterize him on the pubis and cauterize him on each flank, and perhaps add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the large one, for this is a successful treatment whose benefit does not fail, God willing.
Chapter thirty-four.
In cauterizing the hemorrhoids of the anus.
If there are chronic, numerous, or single hemorrhoids in the anus, and they are from thick, cold humors or corrupt moistures, and they were treated with what we mentioned in the classification but the treatment did not work, then cauterize the patient with three cauterizations on the lower part of the sacrum, slightly below the table, in a triangular shape.
And a cauterization below the navel by the length of two fingers. And if you estimate that his stomach has become cold and his food is not digested, and you see his face swollen, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cauterization as mentioned before and a cauterization on his liver. And another on his spleen with a nail-shaped cautery.  Leave the cautery open for a while, then treat him until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter thirty-five.
On cauterizing warts.
After cutting it, if the wart is cut, heat the cautery which resembles a needle, then insert it hot into the same cut wart and deepen your hand until the cautery reaches the mouth of the vein from which blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as we have described, then treat them with suitable ointments until they heal.  And if you cauterize a large area with cotton wool, it will be more effective.
Chapter thirty-six.
On cauterizing fistulas which are in the anus and its surroundings.
If the patient does not consent to the incision and the procedure we described in its place and shrinks from that, then perhaps he will heal by cauterization. If a fistula occurs, and pus and foul moisture flow from it for a long time, then the first thing you should do is to measure it with a thin probe.
Then ascertain its depth with the probe, then heat the cautery iron which resembles a needle, then insert it, hot, into the fistula itself, along the course of the fistula to the depth the probe reached, and repeat the cauterization until all those corrupt tissues are burned, once or twice or three times according to your need.
And be careful not to burn a nerve if there is one, or a large vein, and if the fistula opens into the body of the bladder or into the body of the intestine.
Guard against all these places.  You should only do this if the fistula is in a fleshy location and you have estimated that it is not penetrating. Then treat the area until it heals. If the area closes and the flow ceases and remains so for a time, know that it has completely healed.
And if the flow does not cease, know that it is penetrating, or that there is a decayed bone in its depth, or something similar, which will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On cauterizing the kidney.
If pain occurs in the kidney from cold or a strong wind, and the patient's sexual function is thereby diminished, then it is necessary to cauterize it over the loins, on the kidney itself, a cauterization on each kidney with the nail-shaped cautery previously mentioned.  Perhaps you may cauterize it a third time in the same place, so that three cauterizations are made in a row; this will be more effective.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On cauterizing the bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder from cold and dampness, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize it with one cauterization below the navel on the bladder where the pubic hair begins, and one cauterization to the right of the navel and another to the left.
The cauterization on each side should be the size of a thumb joint, and cauterize one or two applications on the lower back if that is needed.  The cautery should be nail-shaped, as previously mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On cauterizing the womb.
If a substance from cold and dampness occurs in the womb, and it is thereby prevented from conception, and its temperament is spoiled, and its courses are difficult, or pain occurs to it upon their arrival, then it should be cauterized with three cauterizations around the navel, as we mentioned in cauterizing the bladder. One or two cauterizations on cotton on the lower back, and the cautery should be nail-shaped.
Chapter Forty.
On cauterizing a dislocated hip.
Erroneous humors may descend to the hip joint, and be the cause of its dislocation.  Its sign is that the leg is longer than the other when they are measured against each other, and you will find emptiness in the place of the dislocation. Then it is necessary to cauterize the patient on the hip joint itself with a semi-circular cauterization.
After you have drawn a circle with ink around the joint, so that the joint itself falls in the middle of the circle. The cautery whose image is presented in the cauterization of the stomach; and if you do not have this cautery, then cauterize with three cauterizations using the large olive-shaped cautery.
Make the cauterization deep enough to reach the entire thickness of the skin, then treat him until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter forty-one.
On cauterizing sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint and its cause is cold and moisture, and you have treated the patient with what we mentioned in the classification, and the treatment has not been effective, and the condition has become chronic, then it is necessary to purge the patient of thick humors with the fetid grain or prickly pear fruit, or something similar.
Then shave it and apply cautery in two ways: either cautery with burning medications or cautery with fire. Cautery with fire can be done in many ways; one of them is to cauterize the hip joint itself with three triangular cauterizations in this manner.
Make them of a suitable depth, and let the distance between each cauterization be the width of a finger. The cautery iron should be olive-shaped.  You may also cauterize one in the middle, on the head of the hip itself, making four cauterizations. Or if you wish, cauterize it with the circle previously mentioned in cauterizing a dislocated hip, as a single cauterization.
So that the circle surrounds the entire hip and burns the entire thickness of the skin. This is the method of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize two areas on the thigh at the point where the patient indicates pain, and one above the heel, four finger-widths towards the outer side, slightly. The cautery iron should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the cauterization should be only the thickness of the skin.
If he indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize where he indicates with a pointed cautery iron, three or four times, or more if necessary. If he indicates pain below the knee towards the leg, cauterize there with one knife-shaped cauterization.
In all your cauterizations, take care not to burn a nerve or a large artery, lest you cause the patient a serious or lasting injury.
I have seen one and another who were cauterized above the heel, and the cauterization was excessive, so that the leg became gangrenous, the gangrene reached the foot, and it became completely perforated, and the whole leg became corrupted, and then diarrhea and death followed.  If the pain is in both sides, cauterize both in this same manner.
Some learned physicians have mentioned a cauterization of the hip of this sort:  A cup-like instrument is made of iron, its diameter half a span, and its mouth the thickness of a date pit, or a little less; and inside this cup is another cup, and a third.
The distance between each cup is the width of a thumb joint; the cups are open on both sides; their height is about one or two finger joints; and a handle of firmly attached iron is made for them.  This is its form.
Then it is heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, then it is placed on the hip joint, the patient leaning on the healthy side; three round cauterizations are made at once, then it is left for three days, and dressed with butter, and the wound is left open for some days.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  The author of this book says: We have seldom used this type of cauterization because of its ugliness and the horror of its appearance, and because of the few who can endure it; however, it is a good cauterization for those who endure it and for whom its application is appropriate.
As for cauterization with burning drugs, two cup-like rings are made, similar to those through which the door hinges descend, of copper or iron.
Their rims have a height of about two finger joints or so; the distance between them is the thickness of a finger; they are open at the bottom and open at the top; and some are joined to others in this manner.
Then it is lowered onto the hip joint, the patient lying on his healthy side, and your hand is firmly held; then, between the circles, pour some sharp water, slightly warmed by the fire, and hold it for the duration of an hourglass; and let the patient endure its stinging and burning, for he will feel a burning like fire.
Until the stinging subsides, then raise your hand with the instrument, and wipe the sharp water from the entire hip with fresh water; then leave it for three days, applying butter to it until the blackness of the burn disappears, and leave it for days so that pus may flow from it, for this is more effective.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold for it that retains water, in the same manner as was done for the hip.  This is the description of the sharp water, which I have already mentioned in the chapter on the preparation of medicines.
Take one part of potash and one part of unslaked lime, crush them, and put them in a new pot which has a small hole in its bottom, large enough for a probe to enter; and place another glazed pot under the bottom of the pot.
And pour fresh water over the potash and lime to cover them by a finger's breadth, after having pressed them firmly with your hand; and leave the pot until the sharp water descends into the glazed pot below; then collect all that water and pour it over more fresh lime and potash.
For then it will be extremely sharp, useful in many medical procedures and in cauterizing various parts of the body, because it acts exactly like fire.  There are other medicines that also cauterize the hip, such as thapsia, honey with mustard seeds, and lime with soap, well mixed.
Galen recounts a treatment for hip pain and sciatica from an ancient man, and greatly praises it, claiming that no other treatment is needed and that it cures in a single application.
So much so that a man might enter the bath carried and leave cured. This is done by taking fresh green rue, or if fresh is unavailable, recently dried rue, finely grinding it with a little fat, and applying it to the hip where the pain is, or to the leg, or to the thigh.
Then it is bandaged and left for three hours, or as long as the patient feels the burning subside. Then he enters the bath, and when his body is damp he is immersed in the bath. The pain will cease and he will be healed, God willing. If it is not healed, repeat the application after ten days.
Then, God willing, he will be healed. Know that cauterization with these medicines should not be used unless the body has been purged. Dioscorides mentioned that goat hair, when used to cauterize sciatica, is beneficial.
Cauterization is performed as follows: wool is soaked in old oil and placed on the deep area between the thumb and forearm, closer to the forearm. Then take a dry goat hair.
Ignite it with fire until it becomes an ember, then place it on the wool and leave it until it extinguishes. Then take another and continue doing so until sensation reaches from the middle of the upper arm to the hip and the pain subsides, God willing. This type of cauterization is called goat-hair cauterization.
Chapter forty-two.
Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Pain in the back may occur from many causes, either from a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and the like.  It is caused by the effusion of a cold, moist substance, and cauterization is only performed in this type alone.
That which is caused by the effusion of a cold substance, it is necessary, after the patient has vomited with hellebore and the like, that he be cauterized on his back where the pain is, three rows across the width of the table itself, after marking the location with ink. In each row, five cauterizations or more, according to the patient's tolerance and strength.
The cauterization should be done with a pointed cautery; and if you wish, cauterize it three or four times with a medium-sized nail-shaped cautery, in this manner.
Chapter forty-three.
On cauterizing the beginning of a hump.
This ailment often affects young children, and its initial sign in a child is shortness of breath when standing and moving, and you will find at the end of his dorsal vertebrae a bead that has protruded, standing out from the other beads.
If you see that and want to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery of this shape. Let the cautery take hold on each side of the vertebra evenly; and if you wish, cauterize it around the vertebra with a pointed cautery in two or three rows, and let the points be close to one another. Then treat the area until it heals, as we have mentioned.
And be careful not to use cautery in a hump that is due to a nerve spasm.
Chapter forty-four.
On cauterizing gout and joint pains.
If joint pains are due to cold humors that settle in any member of the body, and if the pains occur in the legs, then it is customary for physicians to call that gout specifically.
If gout whose cause is cold is treated with the types of treatment we mentioned in the division and the pain does not go away, then cauterization will remove it.  This is done by cauterizing around the joints of the legs with many cauterizations after evacuation. The cautery should be olive-shaped and medium-sized, in this manner.
And if you need to cauterize the surface of the leg, do so with a pointed cautery. If the pain ascends to the knees or to the other joints—and this often happens—then cauterize each knee three or four times on each side with this same olive-shaped cautery.
If you need more cauterization than this, cauterize, but do not make your cauterization deep, but rather only to the thickness of the skin. If the pain ascends to the hips or to the back, then use what we mentioned concerning cauterization in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, cauterize around the forearms as if circling two rows. If the pain remains in the fingers, cauterize each knuckle with a point and the metacarpus. If the pain ascends after some days to the elbows or to the shoulders,
cauterize them on each side.  The patient should not be without good management and the taking of medicines, for if he improves his diet and evacuates phlegm, he will be cured with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter forty-five.
On the cauterization of hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin and some intestine and fat descends to the testicle, and this is recent and incipient, then you should order the patient to abstain from food that day and to use laxatives to evacuate the bowels.
Then he should lie on his back before you, and you should order him to strain himself until the fat or intestine protrudes, then you should return it with your finger. Then mark with ink below the hernia on the pubic bone a mark resembling a semicircle, its extremities toward the upper part of the body.
Then heat a cautery of this shape.
Until it becomes white and throws off sparks. Then return the intestine or fat to the abdomen. Then have an assistant place his hand on the area lest the intestine protrude.  You will have separated the patient's legs and placed a pillow beneath, and another assistant will bind his legs.
And another on his chest holding his hands. Then lower the cautery onto the same mark, your hand holding the cautery upright and steady, and hold it until it reaches the bone, or repeat it again if it does not reach the bone on the first attempt.
And take care to prevent the intestine from protruding while you cauterize, lest you burn it, which would cause the patient either death or a great calamity. And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work will not succeed. And the cautery should be gentle for children according to their size, and for adults according to their size.
Then treat the cauterized area after three days with butter until the scab from the fire is gone. Then treat it with other ointments until it heals. And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound closes.
And you should make his diet during his treatment such that it softens his bowels, lest the intestine protrude during straining and defecation. Then, if he wants to get up after forty days, use a tight bandage and keep it on for another forty days.  And let him reduce exertion, overeating and drinking, and loud shouting.
For if this treatment is used in this way, he will heal completely, God willing. And I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its chapter, God willing.  But as for a hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen and is recent, if you wish to prevent it from increasing, cauterize a circular area around it. Let what you burn of the skin be about two-thirds of it. Then treat it as we have mentioned, for it will not increase, God willing. And some of the ancients mentioned cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery in this manner.
After you mark the hernia with ink, making the horizontal line at the top of the hernia and the other line downwards, and you place a single nail-shaped cautery in the middle. The first cautery is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter forty-six.
On cauterizing fistulas.
If pain occurs in some member from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicine does not benefit it, then it should be cauterized with a point cautery.  The cauterization of each member should be according to its size, whether small or large, and according to its weakness or strength.
And if the pain and fistula persist, then if it heals from the first cauterization, well and good; otherwise, repeat the cauterization upon it, for it is the nature of these pains to move from one member to what is near it. Therefore, one should follow them with cauterization until the patient is cured.
Chapter forty-seven.
On cauterizing leprosy.
As for lepers, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially the type of leprosy that is caused by the corruption of phlegm and black bile.
If you intend to cauterize it, look: if the leprosy is beginning, and you have treated it with what we mentioned in the classification, and it has not diminished nor stopped, and you fear for the patient that the corruption will take over his entire constitution, then cauterize him on the head with five cauterizations. One in the usual middle of the head, the second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two on the temples, and one from behind on the nape of the neck.  And prolong your hand with the cautery a little until it affects the bone slightly.
And scales will be removed from it, so that the thick vapors may easily escape from it.  And cauterize it also with a cauterization on the spleen itself, as mentioned before. But if the leprosy has persisted on the patient and appeared clearly, then it is necessary to cauterize these cauterizations which we mentioned on the head. And a cauterization on the tip of the nose, and two cauterizations on the cheeks, and two cauterizations on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the coccyx at the end of the spine, and another above it in the same place, and two on the hips, one on each hip. And two on the knees, one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the breasts, and cauterize on each joint of the joints of his fingers and toes with a cauterization, and on each heel of his feet and forearms.
And be careful of the nerve that is on the back of the heels, lest you burn them.  And a cauterization may be done on the pubic bone, and another on the stomach, and another on the liver. And know that the more cauterizations you do, the more beneficial and effective it will be.
And know that the patient does not feel the pain of the cautery as the healthy person does, because his body is numb. And the cauteries should be large and small according to the organs and joints, as mentioned before in the descriptions of the cauteries.
Then treat the cauterization with barley flour mixed with honey and other treatments until it heals, God willing.
Chapter forty-eight.
Concerning the cauterization of numbness: When a limb becomes numb and is treated with medications, ointments, and bandages, but does not heal, then cauterize the numb limb with cauteries according to the size of the limb, whether large or small. Let your cauterization be deep, penetrating slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  And some numbness that affects the hand and foot in the vertebrae of the back, at the exit of the nerve that moves that limb, may be cauterized, and the numbness will go away.
And let none undertake this except one who is knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
Chapter forty-nine.
Concerning the cauterization of vitiligo.
If vitiligo is longstanding and no medical treatment has been effective, cauterize it slightly, to the depth of the skin's thickness, so that the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour, rose oil,  plantain leaves, and pigeon or turtledove blood; one part of each. Mix everything together, apply it to a cloth, and bind it to the area until it heals.
Chapter fifty.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
If the cancer is incipient and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it spreads. Some wise men have mentioned that a strong cauterization should be done in its center, but I do not agree with this, because I expect it to ulcerate, and I have witnessed this many times.
The correct method is to cauterize around it in a circle, as we said, or with many cauterizations.
Chapter fifty-one.
Concerning the cauterization of the fistula.
If a fistula occurs and is slow to mature, either because of the causative factor, or because of the patient's age if he is old and anemic, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the fistula, cauterize around it with many small cauterizations, sparsely.
Then leave it, for it will hasten maturation.  If you wish to stop it with cauterization, heat the cautery iron, the picture of which is this.
And insert it into the middle of the fistula until it penetrates the skin. Let the cauterization be from what is below, so that the pus may flow easily. Then treat it as necessary until it heals.
Chapter fifty-two.
On cauterizing the ulcer.
An ulcer is a corruption that spreads in the member, eating it as fire eats dry wood. If you see an ulcer in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, heat many small and large, nail-like cauteries according to what is suitable for that place where the ulcer is.
Then cauterize it from every side until all the corruption is eradicated and nothing remains at all. Then leave it for three days and apply to the cauterized areas powdered sulfur with oil until all the eschar and all the corruption are removed.
Then treat it with ointments that promote the growth of flesh. If after three days you see that the flesh grows healthy without corruption, that is good; otherwise, repeat the cauterization on what remains of the corrupted areas.  The ulcer may also be treated with a caustic medicine.
For it acts in place of fire, more quickly beneficial. And I have mentioned its treatment with caustic medicine in the section; take it from there when you need it.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On the cauterization of inverted and non-inverted nails.
This condition frequently occurs on the soles of the feet; it is a rough thing that pains the person.  Cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with fire or cauterization with a caustic liquid.
As for cauterization with fire, you heat a hollow cautery iron, similar to an eagle's feather, made of iron to the size that surrounds the nail on all sides, and it should have a thin edge; then you apply it hot to the nail, and then you rotate your hand with the cautery iron around the nail until the cautery iron reaches the depth of the nail.
And you leave it for three days, during which it will suppurate, then you dress it with pounded wild lettuce mixed with salt, and leave the dressing on it for a night; then it will separate from its roots, and then you treat the wound site with a flesh-growing ointment until it heals, if the nails are not inverted.
This frequently occurs on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet.  You should take a tube of copper, iron, or eagle's feather and place it over the nail or wart, then pour a small amount of caustic liquid into the tube.
Hold your hand as you rotate it, gently moving your hand to allow the edge of the tube to affect the root of the nail, and the caustic liquid will find its way to penetrate to the root of the nail. The patient should endure the stinging of the caustic liquid for a short time.
Then leave it, for the nail will separate from its roots.  Do this one by one until you have treated all of them on the body. Then treat the areas after they have separated with ointments that grow flesh.
Chapter fifty-four.
On cauterizing the  falling sickness.
If someone suffering from falling sickness experiences a cold in the nerves or a quartan fever or something similar, then it is necessary to cauterize him four or five times on the vertebrae of the back, with one cauterization between each vertebra, and one cauterization on his chest. And one cauterization on his stomach with the olive cautery, for the falling sickness is calmed and the cold illness is hastened to ripen.
Chapter fifty-five.
On cauterizing pustules occurring in the body.
Ugly pustules may erupt in the body, arising from cold, thick, corrupt materials.  At their first appearance, it is necessary to cauterize each pustule gently with a cautery stick whose end has been lit with fire, or with a long root of ziraund, or with a lenticular cautery.
And boils may be cauterized at their first eruption in this manner, so that the active principle causing them does not increase, and the patient recovers from them. However, this should be done after the patient has been bled.
Chapter fifty-six.
On cauterizing bleeding that occurs when an artery is cut.
Frequently, bleeding occurs from an artery that has been severed during a wound inflicted from the outside, or during the incision of a tumor, or the cauterization of a member, and so forth, making it difficult to stop.
If this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the mouth of the artery and press it firmly to confine the blood beneath your finger so that nothing escapes. Then place several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire and heat them until they are very hot.
Then take one, either small or large, depending on the wound and the place where the artery has burst, and apply the cautery to the same vein after quickly removing your finger, and hold the cautery until the bleeding stops.
If, when you lift your finger from the mouth of the artery, the bleeding resumes and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another cautery from those in the prepared fire, and continue to do this one after another until the bleeding stops.
Be careful not to burn a nerve that is there, lest another affliction befall the patient. And know that if blood flows from an artery, it cannot be stopped, especially if it is a large artery, except in one of four ways: either by cauterization, as we have said; or by amputation, if it has not already been amputated; for if it is amputated, its ends contract and the bleeding stops; or it may be tightly bound with threads; or medicines that stop blood flow may be applied to it, and it may be firmly compressed with compresses.
But whoever attempts to stop it with a bandage, or by compression with cloths, or by applying cauterizing agents and the like, will not succeed in stopping it at all, except rarely. If this happens to someone and no physician or medicine is available, he should quickly place his index finger on the mouth of the wound itself, as we have described.
He should press it very hard until the blood is constricted and flows from above the wound and onto the artery. The finger should not be removed; constantly apply very cold water to it until the blood coagulates, thickens and stops. During this time, you should consider what cauterization or medicine is needed.
Chapter Two.
Concerning incisions, punctures, bloodletting, wounds, and the like.
Khalaf said: In the first chapter we mentioned every disease suitable for cauterization with fire and caustic medicine, its causes, its reasons, its instruments, the types of cautery irons, and we made that into chapters from the head to the foot.
And I follow in this chapter the same method, to make it easier for the student to obtain what he seeks.
Before I begin with that, you should know, my sons, that this chapter contains more subtleties than the first chapter on cauterization.
And because of that, caution should be more stringent, because in the procedures of this chapter, there is often a risk of losing blood essential to life when opening a vein or incising a tumor, lancing an abscess, treating a wound, removing an arrow, incising a stone, and the like, all of which are accompanied by danger and fear, and often result in death.
And I advise you against undertaking what is doubtful, for in this craft various kinds of people will come to you with various kinds of illnesses; some of them are so weary of their illness that death is indifferent to them.
Because of the severity of their illness and the length of their suffering, and because of the established signs of death in their illness, and some of them give you their money and enrich you with it in hope of health, and their illness is fatal, you should not help at all anyone who comes to you who is in this condition.
Let your caution be stronger than your desire and eagerness, and do not proceed with any of this except after certain knowledge that assures you of a favorable outcome.  And in all the treatment of your patients, use foreknowledge and warning about what leads to recovery.
For in that you have help in gaining praise, glory, mention, and thanks. May God inspire you, my sons, with His guidance and not deprive you of correctness and success, for that is in His hand; there is no god but He.
And I have arranged the chapters of this section as in the preceding section on cautery, from head to foot, so that what you want from it may be easier for you, God willing.
Chapter One.
In the treatment of the water which collects in the heads of children.
This ailment frequently occurs in infants at birth if the midwife presses the infant's head without gentleness, and it may also occur from a hidden cause which is not known.
And I have not seen this ailment in anyone other than infants, and all those I have seen among them have quickly died; therefore, I considered leaving treatment, and I have seen an infant whose head was full of water and whose head grew larger every day. until the infant could not sit up because of the size of his head, and the moisture increased until he perished.
And this moisture either gathers between the skin and the bone, or gathers under the bone on the dura mater.  The procedure in this case, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, is that one should make an incision in the middle of the head, transversely, the length of the incision being about two fingerbreadths, until the moisture flows out. This is an image of the scalpel.
If the moisture is greater and the swelling is larger, then make two intersecting incisions in this manner:
And if the moisture is under the bone—and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side, and the water subsides if you press it with your hand inwards, and this is not hidden from you—then you should make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner.
After the incision, all the moisture will come out, then tighten the incisions with cloths and bandages.  Then dress it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day. Then untie the bandage and treat the wound with lint and ointments. Do not leave off binding the head moderately, and nourish the patient with every dry food, low in moisture.
Until the member strengthens and heals. Another description of the incision is that you look where the bone of the swelling and the gathering of water appear, for it may be in the back of the head more, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left.
Then aim the incision where the swelling and the fullness of water appear to you, and incise it as much as you can, and be careful not to cut an artery, lest bleeding occur and the patient die from that bleeding, along with the evacuation of the moisture.
Chapter Two.
Cutting the two arteries behind the ears, known as the "al-ḥasīsayn".
When someone is afflicted with acute attacks in the eyes or chest, and this persists and the treatment of medicines does not work, then the best treatment for that is to cut these two arteries.
Then, if you wish to cut them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to reveal the artery, then tighten the patient's neck with the excess of his garment, then look where the pulse beats and their locations, the two low-lying places behind the ears, and they rarely hide except in some people.
Then mark them with ink, then cut them with a lancet, a clean cut to the bone; this should be done across the head.  And if you wish, insert the lancet under the artery and cut upwards, and the length of the cut should be about two joined fingers.
If the artery is cut, the blood will gush out in a pulsating manner, leaping forward in successive throbs. If the artery is not palpable, you should measure three finger-breadths from the ear, then mark it with ink and incise to the bone. What should be...
...sent from the blood six ounces at once, and perhaps more or less is sent, all according to the strength of the patient and the fullness of his arteries that appears to you. Then look at the wound; if something of the peritoneum remains on the bone, cut it away.
Lest a hot swelling occur, then bind the wound with a thread of linen rags, then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
In the ligation of the two arteries in the temples.
If a person suffers from chronic migraine or acute attacks from acrid humors and heat in the muscles of the temples, or severe chronic headache and the like, and he has been treated with various medical treatments without success, then we have tried in these diseases the ligation or cauterization of the arteries of the temples as we have described.
And the method of ligating them is that the patient's hair in the temples should be shaved, and the artery appearing in the temple should be sought, for it will be evident to you from its pulsation, and it rarely hides except in a few people.
Or in severe cold, if it is hidden from you, let the patient tighten his neck with the excess of his garment, then you rub the area with a cloth or compress the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly and obviously. Then take the scalpel, whose image is this. Then you incise the skin gently with it until you reach the artery, then you throw a hook into it and pull it upwards until you bring it out of the skin and free it from the membranes under it from every side; and if the artery is thin, then twist it with the end of the hook. Then cut off a portion of it to the extent that its ends are separated and constricted, and do not cause bleeding; for if it is not severed and cut off, the blood will not flow at all. Then it is evacuated of blood from six ounces to three.
If the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with strong doubled thread; and let the thread be either of silk or of lute strings, lest decay quickly reach it before the wound heals, and bleeding occurs.
Then cut what is between the ligatures; do this at that time or after another time. And if you wish, cauterize it with a knife-like cautery to the bone until its ends are severed; this performs the same function or better, as we said.
Unless the patient has a fever or a hot temperament, for cauterization is among the things that help to consume humors, and it is more certain in benefit.  After ligating the arteries, it is necessary that the place be packed with worn cotton and that firm bandages be applied. After healing, it is treated with dry medicines which generate flesh, and with bandaging, until it heals, God willing.
If bleeding from the artery occurs during your work, quickly cut it, either by cauterization or by filling the place with alum and tightening your hand until the blood stops. If you do not have any of that, place your finger there until the blood clots.
Then wash the place with very cold water until the sharpness subsides, and bind it appropriately.  What is easier and simpler than ligating the artery is to cauterize the vein with this double-bladed cautery, after marking the two places with ink.
And lower it, very hot, until it reaches the bone and the vein is severed in two places so that its ends are separated, for it will not reunite with this cauterization at all.  This is an image of the cautery.
The blades should be sharp, resembling small awls, except that they should be much less sharp than a knife, because if they are as sharp as a knife, they cool more quickly and the flesh will not be cut quickly. If they have some thickness, the heat of the fire will be retained in them.
And the flesh is cut quickly. This procedure is better than any other, and lighter and easier.  Let the distance between the blades be the width of a finger.
Chapter Four.
In the treatment of the constant flow of hot tears into the eyes.
If the tears are constant and their flow is from the veins on the outside of the skull and nothing from medical treatment with drugs has benefited, and you see the patient's face has reddened. And he feels a crawling on his forehead like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are weak and moist, their eyelashes are eroded and his eyelids are drawn together from the severity of the tears.  Therefore, the ancients in treating it resorted to this procedure, and they call it treatment with the sword, which is that you order the patient to have the hair shaved from his forehead.
Then you make three parallel incisions in the forehead along the length of the forehead. The length of each incision should be about two fingers, one incision parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second a little distance from the movement of the muscle in the temple, and the third on the other side.
And be careful not to cut the two arteries on the sides, and keep your hand away from the connection of the jaws.  The distance between each incision should be about three joined fingers, and have with you prepared pieces of sponge or many dry cloths to wipe away the blood.
Then insert the double-edged scalpel, whose image is this. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, and with it you flay all the skin between the two incisions together with the membrane on the bone. Then you do the same also from the middle incision to the third incision. Then remove this scalpel. And also insert into the first incision another instrument called a scalpel, sharp on one side and smooth, not sharp, on the other; and this is its image:
And place its sharp side upwards towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision, and cut with it all the vessels which descend from the head to the eyes, without the cut reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do this in the middle incision to the other incision.  After a moderate amount of blood has flowed, squeeze the areas of clotted blood. Then place in each incision a cotton wick, and place over it a dressing moistened with a syrup and oil, or vinegar and oil.
Lest a hot swelling occur. On the third day, untie the bandage and use much washing with lukewarm water. Then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and whatever else you treat wounds with, until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
In the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from the interior of the head.
When someone experiences frequent, sharp, severe, persistent discharges, and you see his eyes weak, small, and his vision weakened, and his eyelids ulcerated, and the eyelashes falling out. And there is severe, painful pain in the depth of the head and continuous sneezing. Know from these symptoms that these materials and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment is this: order the patient to have his forehead shaved, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead.
And there is severe, painful pain in the depth of the head and continuous sneezing. Know from these symptoms that these materials and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment is this: order the patient to have his forehead shaved, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead. Or slightly higher horizontally, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple. The incision should reach the bone, and keep your hand away from the temporal muscles that move during chewing, until the bone is exposed and all the blood is dried with a sponge.
Then separate the edges of the incision with old cotton or a linen thread, then bandage from above and soak the bandages with syrup and oil, lest a hot swelling occur. When you remove them and see that the hot swelling has subsided, you should scrape the bone until the growth of flesh begins.
Then treat it with a drying preparation that produces flesh, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, preparing an ointment from them and using it for flesh growth in such wounds.
Chapter Six.
On the treatment of what falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic stone or a semi-stone like iron and glass; or a vegetable seed like chickpeas and kernels and the like; or a flowing thing like water and vinegar and the like.
Or an animal. When a stone or a kind of stone falls into the ear which does not grow in the ear, then expose the ear to the sun. If you see the stone, then instill some violet oil or cerate into it, then try to remove it by moving the head or sneezing with a sternutatory. And plug the nostrils when sneezing comes, after you place a ring of rags or wool around the ear and extend the ear upwards. Often it comes out with this treatment. If it does not come out otherwise, then try to remove it with a gentle probe, the image of which is this.
If it comes out with the probe, otherwise try to remove it with a gentle, slightly curved, blind hook. If it does not come out with that, then make a tube of copper and insert the end of the tube into the hole of the ear gently.
And seal what is around the tube with pitch softened with oil, lest there be a way for the wind other than the tube, then draw it with your breath strongly, and often it comes out with that. If it does not come out with what we described, then take a little of the gum of Nabataea or of the prepared gum with which birds are caught, and put it on the tip of the probe.
After wrapping tightly a piece of cotton around it, then insert it into the hole of the ear gently after drying the ear from moisture. If it does not come out with all that we described, then proceed to incision before hot inflammation or spasm occurs.
The description of the incision is that you first bleed the patient in the cephalic vein and remove blood from him according to his strength. Then you seat the patient before you and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear near its lobe in its lowest part.
And the incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone, then remove it with whatever instruments you can. Then quickly stitch the incision and treat it until it heals.
But if the thing that has fallen into the ear is one of the seeds that grow and swell, try to remove it as mentioned. If it does not respond to removal, then take a thin, delicate scalpel of this shape.
And try with it to cut that type of seed that has fallen into the ear.  You only do this if you are certain that the seed has become moistened by the vapor of the ear until it becomes many small pieces, then remove them with a blind probe or a soft sponge or by suction.
As we mentioned, then it is easy to remove it. As for water entering the ear, the patient should first use sneezing with hellebore, having filled his ear with some old cotton while lying on the ear containing the water. If it comes out with that,
otherwise, take many small, smooth pebbles the length of the fingers, warm them slightly by fire, and let the patient insert one into the hole of his ear. He should press down on his foot on that side and strike the stone in the ear with another stone.
He continues to do this with one pebble after another until all the water comes out.  The water may also come out by taking a piece of papyrus or a feather, inserting one end into the ear, and applying fire to the other end until most of it burns, then repeating with another feather.
Do this repeatedly until all the water comes out or draw it out with a tube as was described for the pebble. As for removing an animal that has entered, see if it is small in body like a flea and so on, treat it as described in the section, and as for...
if its body is large enough to be felt, try to remove it with forceps and hooks. This is easier than anything else that gets into the ear. As for removing worms that develop in the ear, if you treat them as mentioned in the section on instillations and your treatment is not effective,
you should look into the ear in the sun. If you see anything of the worms, remove them with forceps or fine hooks. If you do not see anything, take a tube of this shape.
narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, and insert the thin end into the ear as far as the patient can tolerate. Then suck strongly, doing this repeatedly until all the worms come out. If they do not come out, seal around the tube with wax as I described for the pebble.
If they do not come out by what we have mentioned, use the instillations I have mentioned, which the ancients have tried in killing worms. You will find that in the section on instillations.  Pouring oils and medicines into the ear is done with this instrument, and this is its shape:
As you see, make it from silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, wide at the top. If you wish, the nozzle inside the tube can be made of tightly fitting copper. If you wish, you can take a reed and wrap cotton tightly around one end.
Then pour the oil, juice, or whatever medicine you want into the tube while it is in the ear. Then insert the reed with cotton from above and squeeze it gently with your hand until the oil is forced into the ear and felt.
The patient will feel it entering.  Whatever you pour into the ear should be warmed slightly over a fire. Be careful that what is dropped into it is neither too cold nor too hot, for the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
In the treatment of the accidental blockage of the ear.
Some children may be born with their ear openings not perforated.
Also, some people may experience a blockage in the ear canal from a wound or from newly grown flesh. This blockage may be deep within the ear opening, unseen by the eye.
It may also appear slightly outside the opening and be visible. That which appears deep within the ear and is not visible is, in most cases, difficult to cure.  That which is visible should have the patient's ear exposed to the sun. And look into it; if you see the blockage, open it with a delicate scalpel, which is of this form:
Its tip should be slightly broad at the end, while the rest of the scalpel is smooth on both sides so as not to injure the ear. If the blockage is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with a delicate hook and cut it gently but firmly until all the flesh is removed.
If the blockage is deep in the ear, take a smooth, delicate probe and warm it slightly in the fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the blockage and the patient experiences a feeling of heaviness in hearing, remove it gently.
Be careful not to injure the eardrum. Then insert into the ear a wick to fit the size of the opening, having smeared it with Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are sure the wound has healed. Or take a wick, moisten it in water, and sprinkle powdered vitriol on it.
Use it. If you see that the ear has become swollen with a hot inflammation, you should remove the wick and replace it with another wick that has been smeared with a preparation made with rose oil to calm the hot inflammation, then continue the treatment until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear. Use the other treatments mentioned in the chapter on styptics to stop the bleeding.
Chapter Eight.
On the treatment of warts appearing on the eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry.  They should be grasped with forceps or a hook and cut off at their base with a scalpel. Then apply powdered verdigris to the area.
If it bleeds, cauterize it with a mild lentil-shaped cautery. Cauterization is best after cutting.  It often returns if any of the roots remain, but if cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and it does not return.
Chapter Nine.
On the treatment of cold sores appearing on the eyelids.
Something resembling a cold sore in its intensity and hardness often appears on the eyelids.
Therefore it is called a cold sore, which is a gathering of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids. The treatment is to examine it; if the cold sore is prominent on the surface of the eyelid and moves to every direction, then it is easy to treat, so make a transverse incision on it.
Then gently peel it from every side until it is freed, then suspend it with a hook and cut it. If you cannot cut it except after penetrating the eyelid with the cut, this will not harm the patient. If the incision is large, then close it with sutures and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, then there is no harm from it, for the ointment will heal and join it. If the cold sore is inclined towards the inside of the eyelid, towards the inner surface, then evert the eyelid and suspend the cold sore with a hook without needing an incision, and excise it from every side.
If it penetrates the eyelid with the cut, that will not harm. Then wash the eye after cutting the cold sore with salt water and treat the area with something that will join it until the patient heals.
Chapter Ten.
In the treatment of the stye which appears in the eyelid.
A stye is a fleshy growth that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid. This mostly occurs in children, and it weighs down their eyes, causing them to experience colds at night and prevents them from looking at sunlight. Because the tears flow quickly to them.
Therefore, you see them always leaning on their faces, and on them they sleep, and their eyelids under the eyebrows are moist, swollen, and the stye is clearly visible. When you press the area with your fingers, you feel the stye between them. The procedure is to have the patient place his head in your lap.
Then you take a linen cloth, prepare a wick from it, and make a circle from that wick to the extent that it surrounds the stye from every side, then place it on it and press with your fingers from every side to gather the stye in the middle of the circle.
Then you make a transverse incision in the middle of that moisture with a lancet, and the incision should not be larger than the incision made in bloodletting. As for the depth, you should cut all the skin until you reach the stye.
Then, in most cases, the stye protrudes from the incision in the form of a white piece of fat, so you pull it out with a cloth that you have wrapped between your fingers, while turning your hand right and left until it heals. Beware of increasing the incision lest the lancet reaches the eye and harms it.
If the stye does not appear to you at the first incision, you should gently increase the incision a little until the stye protrudes, then pull it out as we said. Then dip a cloth in vinegar and water, place it on the area, and bind it with a bandage. Some people crush salt.
And they place it inside the incision to dissolve what remains of that moisture. Then treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs in the area, treat it with emollient compresses until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the types of eyelid inflammation.
If superfluous eyelashes grow on the eyelid, outside the natural course beneath the natural eyelashes and brows, they harm the eye and cause various diseases, such as constant tearing, eyelid relaxation, whiteness, and thickening, even to the point of causing blindness.
Eyelid inflammation is of four types: either cauterization with fire, or with a caustic medicine as previously discussed in the chapter on cauterization, or the inflammation may be treated by excision and suturing, or with a reed, as I shall describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand; if it does not turn, then insert a needle threaded with silk from beneath the eyelid, passing the needle and thread from above, close to the hair itself, and draw the eyelid upwards with the thread.
Turn it over with a probe, then incise the inner eyelid below the superfluous hairs with a sharp scalpel, from the larger canthus to the smaller, then remove the thread and place a small pledget of cotton or linen under the eyelid, and mark the eyelid with ink.
Like the shape of a laurel leaf, except that the shape should be according to how much you want to raise the eyelid, because people vary in this; some may need a portion of the eyelid to be excised, according to the degree of relaxation of the eyelid.
And some need less to be cut; all this is according to the relaxation of the eyelid.  Then incise with the scalpel along the two lines that you have marked, beginning from the larger canthus to the smaller, and let each incision be near the natural hair, about the thickness of a probe.
Then insert the hook into one corner of the skin and strip it all off, then gather the edges with stitches using a fine woolen needle and thread, wipe away the blood, and stick the remaining threads to the eyebrows with some adhesive substance.
If you wish to do that, otherwise it does not matter. Then leave the stitches and threads for about three or four days, then treat it. And if you wish, leave the wound without stitching and treat it with things that dry and constrict, for the eyelid will rise when the wound heals and comes together; stitching is better.
This method of blepharoplasty was mentioned by the ancients, although it is burdensome for the patient; it is a good procedure and has no danger. Another method of blepharoplasty is also to mark on the eyelid a shape like a laurel leaf, as we described. Then raise the eyelid with three hooks, either separated or grouped in this manner:
Then cut off the excess eyelid with small scissors, in this manner, in moderate pieces:
If you cannot hold the hooks and they do not straighten for you, then take a needle with thread and insert it into the middle of the shape, and insert another thread near the larger canthus and a third thread near the smaller canthus, and gather the threads between your fingers moderately, then raise your hand with them moderately.
Raise the marked skin completely as we described, then join the edges of the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals. If hot swelling appears when you cut or incise, then soothe that swelling with cyrrhotum or similar soothing ointments.
The lower eyelid may also have its margins inverted; you should use in this case what we mentioned of cutting, suturing, cauterization with fire, and with a caustic medicine; cauterization with fire or with a caustic medicine is more effective and gentler for the patient than cutting and suturing, and I make use of both in these cases.
Cauterization with a reed is done in this way: you invert the eyelid and make an incision on the inside as described, then make two thin reeds or pieces of wood, their length equal to the length of the eyelid and their width less than the width of a scalpel.
And you cut at their ends on both sides where the threads are attached, then gently bring them together on what remains of the eyelid and tie the two reeds tightly on both sides and leave it for some days; then the tightened skin will die, turn black, and become necrotic.
Until it falls off by itself; if it is slow, cut it with scissors, then treat it until it heals. When it is healed, the eyelid will be raised and the eyelashes will not be inverted. This is an image of the two reeds: make them in this shape and this exact size in length and width.
Chapter Twelve.
On raising inverted eyelashes from the eye with a needle.
If there is one or two hairs, the procedure is to take a thin needle and insert a smooth, thin silk thread into it, then bring the two ends together and tie them in a very delicate knot, and let the length of the thread be about a span.
Then attach another thin thread to the hook, shorter than the first, and tie its ends if you wish. Then have the patient put his head in your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the work may be clear, for it is delicate work. Then insert the needle with the hook into the root of the extra hair.
And quickly pass it through the eyelid until you bring it out above the natural hair, then pull the thread upwards towards the hook and insert into the hook that hair, whether it is one, two, or three, but no more.
Then pull with your hand until the hair comes out with the hook in the eyelid along with the natural hair. If you pull the hook and the hair does not come out with it, pull the hook downwards with the thread you attached to it until the hook comes out of the upper hole.
Then return the hair into it and pull them both. Do this until it rises in the upper hole and you see it clearly. Then remove the hook and the thread and take them out, and bind the eye and leave it bound for two or three days until the hair settles in its place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, either add a long hair from the natural hair to it so that it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer after a while, then raise it.
Chapter Thirteen.
In the treatment of the sty that occurs in the upper eyelid.
The condition to which this sty is exposed is called arnabiyya, and this sty is either natural or accidental. The accidental one is from the healing of a wound or a cut or cauterization and the like.
The method of treatment is to incise that adhesion and separate its lips, and place a linen wick between them and tie it until it heals.  It is not advisable to use things that dry and constrict in its treatment.
For if you do that, the sty will return more severely than it was. Rather, use things that relax, such as fenugreek and a poultice with water in which alkanet and flaxseed have been boiled, and a diachylon ointment melted with some fats.  Smear the wick with it and treat it with this.
The key to its treatment is to try by every means to prevent it from adhering in the way it was initially.  This treatment that we have mentioned is only some improvement of the sty, not a restoration of the area to its original state at all.
Chapter Fourteen.
On the treatment of a sty which occurs in the lower eyelid.
This sty which forms in the lower eyelid is what is truly called a sty, and it is both natural and accidental. The accidental kind results from a wound, incision, cautery, or the like.
The method of treatment is to take a needle with doubled thread, and to insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left canthus to the right canthus, so that the thread lies at both ends of the flesh. Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a wide scalpel.
If the shape of the eyelid returns to what is proper, then that is it. Otherwise, take a probe and place it on the site of the incision, and manipulate the eyelid with it, and make two incisions in the inner aspect of the eyelid.  The ends of the two incisions should meet at the corners of the previous cut, so that they form an angle. Until, when they meet, their shape becomes similar to this shape:
This is the Greek letter lambda. Then remove that flesh to the extent that the sharp edge is below what is next to the eyelid. Then gather the separated parts with two stitches, sewing it with a wool thread, and then treat it with the previously mentioned emollient and astringent medications until it heals.
And if the fistula resulted from an incision, suture, or cauterization, then it is necessary to make a simple incision without the hairs of the eyelids, as mentioned before, then separate the lips with a tent, as we have mentioned.
In short, in the treatment of a fistula, whether it is above or below, you should proceed according to the form of the fistula, for it may vary greatly in appearance, and the skilled surgeon devises a method in whatever way is possible.
Until the shape returns to its natural form or approximates it.  The disease itself, in most cases, indicates the appropriate procedure and instrument.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion may occur to many people, such that the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, preventing easy movement and hindering its natural functions.  It is then necessary to insert the point of a probe under the eyelid.
And lift it upwards or stretch it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a gentle scalpel, not sharply like cutting scalpels, but rather somewhat dull, lest the patient be disturbed during the operation and the scalpel slip, injuring the eye with its sharpness.  Your cutting should be as if you are peeling off that adhesion.
Wait until the eyelid returns to its natural state and the adhesion is completely healed. Then pour into the eye salt water to wash it, or instill a solution of vitriol in water, then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen thread.
And place on top of the eye wool soaked in egg white, and after the third day use emollient eye-salves until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the excision of pterygium and the fleshy excrescences of the conjunctiva.
Pterygium is of two kinds: either nervous, resembling a thin, hard membrane; or non-nervous, resembling a firm, white moisture; if touched with an iron instrument or seized with forceps, it is torn.
And a forceps has not been fixed in it. Both types begin from the larger caruncle, extending little by little until they cover the pupil and obstruct light and the movement of the eye.  The procedure for its excision is that the patient places his head in your lap.
Then he opens his eyes, and you lift the eyelid with your hand; then you seize the pterygium with a slightly curved forceps and stretch it upwards; then you take a needle and insert into it a horsehair or oxhair and strong thread, and you bend the tip of the needle slightly and pierce it into the middle of the pterygium.
And you pass it through with the needle and tie the pterygium with the thread and stretch it upwards and dissect with the hair the side of the pterygium next to the pupil, as if you were spreading it with the hair to its end; then you cut the remainder at the root of the caruncle with a fine scalpel or small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the caruncle.
Lest there result from its excision a constant flow of tears.  The pterygium may be stretched with the forceps alone, or with the thread as we said, then the smooth scalpel dissects the end, the image of which is this:
And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the cornea, lest it cause a wound and the pupil is injured. Then after the excision, throw into the eye some powdered salt or some vitriol and leave it until the next day; then treat it as necessary until it heals.
If the pterygium is not fibrous and you are unable to insert a needle into it or fix it with forceps, this type of pterygium is often treated with medications, and it heals as described in the classification. If you wish to excise it, open the patient's eye.
And take a fine, smooth scalpel with a weak edge, of this shape: And dissect the pterygium from above gently with it. If you see that it is loosening and disintegrating and the dissection has affected it, then instill into the eye from your instrument vitriol or red vitriol or powdered salt and bind the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure until all of it is gone, unless a hot inflammation interferes in the eye; then leave it and treat the hot inflammation until it heals, then repeat the procedure of dissection until it heals. As for the fleshy excrescence of the canthus…
If the excrescence injures the eye severely, then hook that excrescence with a forceps and cut some of it, but do not overdo the cutting lest it cause tearing, then instill into the canthus red vitriol or white vitriol until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On the excision of the fleshy excrescence and what grows of excess flesh in the eye.
In the eyes of some people, a red fleshy growth may sprout, accumulating until it covers the pupil or approaches it or overflows onto the eyelids, and sometimes the eyelids turn outwards and it resembles a rose flower.
The treatment is that the patient should place his head in your lap, then open his eyes, and you should pick up all that red flesh with suitable forceps.
Or grasp it with a hook or forceps, then cut the flesh, piece by piece, until you have removed all of it, being careful not to injure the eye during the procedure. Your cutting should be either with the scalpel we described for cutting the pterygium, or with small scissors. Like those used to pluck hairs, as their image will be shown in the chapter following this one.
When you have finished cutting and removed all the growth, fill the eye with crushed salt or instill some Armenian bole or similar caustic medicine, and apply a cotton compress soaked in egg white externally to prevent inflammation.
If any of the growth remains and bleeding is excessive, and you fear inflammation, leave the eye and treat it with remedies that reduce swelling, then resume treatment until it heals.  Do the same for excessive flesh of this type that appears in the eye.
However, you should avoid treating any eye weak by nature or circumstance with instruments, and do not undertake any of these procedures unless you are sure that the organ can tolerate the treatment.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the removal of foreign bodies from the eye.
Pterygia are red vessels that grow over the eye, preventing vision and weakening the eye over time. First, you should examine: if the eye with pterygia is strong and has no other disease besides the pterygia,
then the removal is performed as follows: you should have the patient place his head in your lap, then hook the vessels with one or two hooks, according to your skill. The hooks should be delicately curved, in this manner:.
Or there may be two double hooks in one body, in this manner:
Then, gently grasp those vessels with a delicate pair of scissors, and wipe away the blood from time to time until you see that the vessels have been removed from the eye and the bleeding has stopped.  Be careful not to injure the eye with the tips of the scissors.  Let your work be done during midday, facing the sun.
And be very careful in your work so that you do not cut anything other than those vessels. When you have finished, instill green or red vitriol into the eye; its sharpness will destroy what remains of the pterygium. If you are unable to remove it all at that time, apply a bandage to the eye to soothe the pain.
Leave it for some days until the pain subsides and the inflammation is gone, then repeat the operation in exactly the same way until it is healed. This is an image of the appropriate scissors.
Leave it [and the patient's head should be in the student's lap, while another wipes away the tears and checks the front and back of the eye, and you]. The principle of the operation is to open the eye with fixed or triangular specula held by a student.
Sharp; and the patient's head should be in the student's lap, while another wipes away the tears and checks the front and back of the eye, and you have the choice of beginning to grasp from the top or the bottom of the eye. It is preferable to remove two strands in the upper part, one at the end of the iris and the other at its beginning.
Grasp it between the middle and index fingers, then hook the forceps underneath opposite them, then grasp it between the little and ring fingers, and lift your hand gently until you see that all the pterygium has been raised. Cut it from the smaller side if you wish with scissors, or if you wish with a delicate scalpel.
And insert the thread on a needle and raise all the pterygium until it is elevated on the conjunctiva, and do not cut the forceps, for the tears and blood will obscure your vision.
Then cut with scissors what extends beyond the cornea from above and below, so that nothing remains attached except to the cornea. If you can elevate it from the cornea by scraping with the thread, it is better, and this may be possible in some people.
And when you have cut it, let its site be cauterized for several days, until the pain subsides and the inflammation is healed, then resume treatment on it.
Chapter Nineteen.
On restoring the nose.
Physicians call a fistula a polypus. If you treat it with cautery or with the sharp, burning medicine previously described, and it does not heal, then there is no remedy except to incise the swelling when it is ripe and to extract all the moisture or pus within it.
Until the bone is exposed.  And when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument of this shape:.
The rasp is called a head; it is made of Indian iron, and its head is round like a button, finely engraved with the pattern of a file or rasp. You place it on the corrupted part of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers, pressing gently with your hand, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away.
Do this repeatedly, then dress the wound with drying, astringent medicines. If the wound closes and the flesh grows over it, and the discharge ceases, and forty days pass without recurrence, inflammation, or other complication,
know that it has healed. Otherwise, there is no remedy except to return the fistula to the nasal opening in this way:  You expose the bone again with an iron instrument or with a sharp medicine. When the bone is exposed, take a probe of this shape:
The tip of the instrument is triangular, and its shaft is conical, tapering towards the tip, as you see. Then place it on the bone itself, near the ethmoid and slightly away from the eye. Then rotate your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it.
He will feel air escaping from it when he holds his hand to his nose. Then dress the wound with the drying astringent medicines as I have instructed you. When the flesh grows and the place is firm, the matter that was discharging externally will return to the nose, which will be easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
In returning the protrusion of the eye.
If the eye protrudes in its entirety, and no damage or deficiency occurs in the vision, then you should ease the patient, and then bleed him in the cephalic vein, then apply a cupping glass to the nape of the neck without restriction, and gently suck.
Then apply to the eye pledgets made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and gum tragacanth. Then bandage the eye from above with many soft bandages. The preparation of the bandages is to take many soft, thin pieces of linen, and fold each piece into four layers, making many of them.
Then place them one on top of the other as much as the eye needs, then bind them tightly with a firm cloth, and repeat cupping without restriction. Then remove the cupping glass and leave the eye bandaged for a day and a night.
If the bandage loosens during that time, then it should be tightened gently. Then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we said. If you see that the eye has returned, otherwise, repeat the application of the pledgets, bandages, tightening, and cupping until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On the excision of the uvula.
If a hernia occurs in the uvular layer, then it protrudes and emerges outside the eyelids like a grape, and the person's appearance is disfigured because of it, and you wish to excise it, then the procedure is as I describe.
It is that you insert a needle into the root of the uvula from below upwards, then insert another needle with a doubled thread from the side of the uvula and pass it through, and leave the first needle as it is.
Then you cut the place where the doubled thread bends and tie some of the uvula around the needle with it and pull it gently, then you remove the needle and place on the eye wool moistened with egg white and leave it until the threads fall off with the uvula, then you treat the eye with what strengthens it.
Until the wound heals.  And you may pull the uvula from every direction with a circle of cloth until the eye is further protruded gently, then you incise with a thin scalpel reaching to the depth of the eye so that the white moisture flows and the eye descends and withers in place, then you pull it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-two.
In the treatment of the uvula.
This ailment which is called kimana is a fluid which gathers in the eye resembling running water, but it is not. The method of treatment is that you seat the patient on a chair upright, then you take his head in your hands from both sides.
And move it until you see the fluid go to the lower part with your eye, then it is fixed and does not move, and the light departs and the patient sees things as he used to see them. And if it does not descend to the lower part, we know that it is water; if the descent of the fluid is not achieved by what we have mentioned.
Otherwise, seat the patient before you, then take a thin scalpel and make a small incision with it above the cornea at the point of junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the ciliary region until the substance comes out.
When it comes out, instil into the eye hot water in which honey has been mixed, or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled, then treat with other treatments until he recovers.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
We have already mentioned the types of water in the classification and which is suitable for cupping, in a detailed and explained statement, so take that from there correctly. Then you should seat the patient before you, sitting squarely facing the light near the sun.
And you bind his healthy eye and tie it tightly, then you lift the eyelid of his eye with your left hand if the eye in which the water is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then you place the tip of the cupping instrument near the cornea, with the thickness of an awl, in the same white of the eye on the side of the smaller canthus, then you push the cupping instrument forcefully while turning it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel with the cupping instrument that it has reached something empty.
And it should be that the extent to which the cupping instrument goes into depth is the extent of the distance which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness, which is the cornea of the eye, for the copper is seen by the same observer with the naked eye due to the clarity of the corneal membrane, then you move the cupping instrument upwards to the place in which the water is.
Then you press it downwards time after time. If the water descends immediately, then the patient will see what his sight has been opened to immediately, with the cupping instrument in his eye, then it rests a little. If the water rises, then lower it again without removing the cupping instrument.
Then if it settles and does not rise, remove the cupping instrument gently while twisting it with your hand little by little, then dissolve in the water some clean Andarani salt and wash the eye with it from the inside, then apply to the outside of the whole eye a compress or wet wool.
With rose oil and egg white, and you bandage it with the healthy eye. As for us and the people of our time, we place crushed cumin with egg white on it. If the cupping instrument does not respond to entering the eye due to its hardness, because some people have very hard eyes, Then you should take the scalpel which is called the *barīd*, whose image is this:
Then pierce with it only the adherent part and do not exaggerate in the piercing; rather, it is that you make a delicate opening for the cupping instrument, then insert the cupping instrument as we have mentioned. When your work is complete, prepare for the patient a firm recumbent position in which he sleeps on his back in a dark room.
And he abstains from all movements and from coughing, and you make his food that which softens his constitution, and he does not move his head to the right or to the left at all, and the bandage remains in place until the third day, then you untie it in that dark room and test his sight.
And you show him things, then you return the bandage until the seventh day. And it is not appropriate to do this during treatment or after cupping at your hour, but rather you should avoid that before the water rises quickly with intense vision.
If a hot swelling appears, then it is necessary to untie the eye before the seventh [day] and treat that with what calms the swelling, until when it is calmed, then at that time you release his sight and place on his face a veil which trains his sight from under it for days while he is in that dark room, then...
he leaves the house gradually and manages his affairs. And know that in cupping, the learner cannot dispense with observation many times, then afterwards he proceeds to the work. And it has reached me from some Iraqis that he mentioned that he makes in Iraq a cupping instrument that is penetrating, with which he sucks out the water.
And I have not seen anyone in our country make that, nor have I read it in any book of the ancients.  And it is possible that this is recent. And this is an image of types of cupping instruments for those ignorant of them:
It is made especially of copper, and its tip is of this very thinness, triangular-tipped, sharp.
Chapter twenty-four.
In the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
Various superfluous flesh may grow in the nose; some resembling a scorpion with many legs, some cancerous flesh, hardened and dark in color, and some soft flesh, not dark in color.
If any of this flesh is soft, not malignant nor cancerous, then you should have the patient sit before you facing the sun, open his nostril, and insert the snare into that flesh, then draw it outwards, then cut off what you have grasped with a delicate, sharp scalpel from one side.
Until you know that all the flesh has gone; if any remains which you could not cut, then remove it gently with one of the delicate instruments, so that nothing remains.  If the bleeding overcomes you or a hot inflammation occurs,
then treat it as is appropriate. If it is one of the malignant tumors, then act quickly to cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is gone. Then put vinegar and water or a potion in the nose after the cutting. If the nose opens and the moisture passes through to the throat,
know that he is healed. If the moisture does not pass through as it should, then know that inside there is flesh growing on the top of the porous bones which the instrument did not reach by cutting. Then you should take a linen thread of some thickness.
and tie many knots in it, making the space between each knot the width of a finger or less.  The patient should skillfully insert one end of the thread into his nose with a probe or whatever is possible after he has made it like a button, and draw his breath until it reaches the pharynx.
and it comes out at his throat. Children in school often do this, and it is easy for those who want to. Then bring together the two ends of the thread, the one which came out of the mouth and the other which remained in the nose.
Then use the knots in the thread to saw the flesh, doing this until you know that the flesh has been cut by the knots of the thread. Then remove the thread and put in the nose, after wiping away the blood, a wick that has been soaked in Egyptian ointment. Do this for three days or more.
until the ointment consumes all that remains of the flesh. Then, finally, put a lead tube in the nose for some days until it heals. If it needs drying treatment, use that.
This is an image of the instrument with which ointments and medicines are dropped into the nose:
It is made of silver or copper, similar to a small, open oil lamp, and its spout is likewise.
And if you wish, make the tube closed like a reed, and the spout of the instrument flat.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, to hold it when you heat the ointment or whatever you wish of juices or flowing things in it.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
Concerning warts growing on the tip of the nose.
Frequently a wart grows on the tip of the nose, and it increases and grows larger with the days until its appearance becomes unsightly.
Therefore it is necessary to cut it off at its first appearance and to excise it completely, then apply to the place either cautery or a burning medicine which serves as a substitute for cautery.  If you miss cutting it off until it grows large, then look: if it is hardened, solid, dark in color, and insensitive,
do not apply the iron to it, for it is a cancerous tumor, and I have often seen those who cut this tumor suffer a great calamity from it.  But if the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that it can be completely cut, then let the patient vomit and cut it off without hesitation or delay, and treat the place with that which dries and contracts until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-six.
On suturing the nose, lip, and ear. If their connection is separated by a wound or something similar, know that when a separation of connection occurs in one of these cartilages, the treatment rarely works except in some people.
So when something like that happens to someone, see if the wound is fresh with its blood; gather the edges of the wound with sutures, then treat it until it heals. And if the separation of the connection has separated its edges and each part is sound, then you should scrape each part to the thickness of its outer skin until it bleeds.
Then gather the edges with sutures and tighten them, and sprinkle on them mastic and frankincense, powdered.  Then place over the sutures a plaster of palm-tree ointment or another adhesive ointment, and leave it bound for two or three days, then unbind it.
And change the dressing and leave it until the threads separate by themselves, then treat it with ointment until it heals. The method of suturing is to gather the separated connection either with needles, as we described in suturing the abdomen, or with thread, as I explained there.
Chapter twenty-seven.
On removing the knots which appear in the lips.
Many people develop small, hard tumors inside their lips; some resemble barleycorns, others are smaller or larger.  You should evert the lip and incise over each nodule and then remove it with a hook.
And cut it from each side, then pack the wound after cutting with powdered alum until the bleeding stops, then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the area with something astringent until the wounds heal.
Chapter twenty-eight.
On cutting away excess gum.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients called epulis. You should hook it with a hook or grasp it with forceps and cut it at its base, and let the blood flow, then apply powdered alum to the area.
Or one of the astringent, drying powders. If that flesh returns after treatment—for it often does—cut it again and cauterize it; for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter twenty-nine.
On extracting teeth with an instrument.
Rough, unsightly crusts may gather on the surfaces of the teeth, inside and out, and between the gums.  These may become black, yellow, or green, even causing damage to the gums and disfiguring the teeth.
You should seat the patient before you, his head in your lap, and clean the tooth or teeth showing crusts or anything resembling sand, until nothing remains.  Do the same with black, green, yellow, or anything else, until you have thoroughly cleaned them.
If this removes the material on the first cleaning, well and good. If not, repeat the cleaning on another day, and then again, until you achieve your goal. Know that a tooth may require different shaped and many kinds of instruments, depending on what is needed.
For the instrument used to clean a tooth from the inside is not the same as that used to clean it from the outside, nor that used to clean between the teeth, which is of yet another form.  These are several forms of instruments that you should have ready.
Chapter Thirty.
On the Extraction of Teeth.
You should treat a toothache by every means, and delay extraction, for there is no replacement for a tooth once it is extracted, as it is a noble substance, except when extraction is unavoidable.
If the patient is determined to have it extracted, you should ascertain that the tooth is indeed the source of the pain. For often the patient is deceived by the pain and thinks it is in a sound tooth, and has it extracted, yet the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is extracted; we have seen this repeatedly done by barbers.
If you are certain that the pain is in that particular tooth, then you should incise around the tooth with a strong scalpel, to loosen the gum on all sides, then move it gently with your fingers or with delicate forceps, little by little, until you loosen it.
Then firmly grasp it with the large forceps, holding the patient's head between your knees, having secured him so that he does not move, then pull the tooth straight out, so as not to break it; and if it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it beneath it from each side gently, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is decayed or carious, you should fill the cavity with a piece of cloth and pack it firmly with the end of a thin probe, lest it crumble when you pull it with the forceps; and you should carefully incise around the gum on all sides.
And take care not to break it, for if some of it remains, it will cause the patient a greater affliction than his first pain; and beware of doing what ignorant barbers do in their haste and recklessness in extracting it without using what we have described.
For they often inflict great harm on people, the least of which is that the tooth breaks and all or part of its roots remain. Or that it pulls out with part of the jawbone, as we have witnessed many times; then, after extraction, let him rinse his mouth with a drink or with vinegar and salt; and if bleeding occurs from the place—which often happens—then crush some alum and plug the place with it.
Otherwise, cauterize it if the alum does not help you. The image of the delicate forceps with which you first move the tooth: they should have long ends, short handles and be thick, lest they bend when you grasp the tooth with them. And this is the image of the large forceps:
They should be, as you see, thick in the handles so that when you grasp them, they do not yield or bend; short in the ends; and let them be of Indian iron or of well-tempered steel, with sharpened ends, and at their tips, teeth that interlock, so that they grasp firmly and tightly.
And the ends may be made like the shape of a file, and they will also be strong in their grip.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On extracting the roots of molars and removing broken jawbones.
If, when extracting a molar, a root remains broken, it is necessary to place a pledget of cotton soaked in butter on the area for a day or two until the area relaxes, then insert the forceps or hooks. whose ends resemble the beak of the bird called the "bulbul", and this is an image of the hooks:
They are made like a file from the inside or like a rasp. If you cannot remove it with these hooks, you should excavate the root and expose all the flesh with a scalpel, then insert the instrument that resembles a small lever, which is depicted here:
short and slightly thick at the tip, and not too pointed, lest it break. If the root is extracted thus, well and good; otherwise, use these other instruments, which are depicted here: the first has a triangular tip and is somewhat thick.
Another fine triangular image:
And we may also use this instrument with two branches, which is also depicted here:
and other instruments and tools previously mentioned in the extraction of molars.  We may also use this instrument which resembles a large hook, which is depicted here:
triangular, curved at the tip, slightly thick so that it does not break, and not too pointed. Know that the instruments for molars are numerous, as are all other instruments; they are almost innumerable, and the skillful and expert craftsman may invent instruments for himself, according to what the work and the diseases themselves indicate.
Because there are diseases for which the ancients did not mention instruments, due to the variety of their types.  If a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth is broken or decayed, then examine it in its place with one of these instruments and hooks that were mentioned in the extraction of roots.
And we use a curette; this is its image:
It should be somewhat thick to grasp the bone so that it does not slip until the bone is removed. We treat the area with appropriate medication. If the bone has slight decay, scrape off its decay and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Two
On the extraction of molars growing on top of others.
If molars grow outside their natural course, they are unsightly, especially in women and slaves.  Therefore, one should look; if the molar has grown behind another molar…
…and its extraction or pushing back is impossible, extract it.  If it is attached to another molar, cut it with this instrument, whose image is this:
It resembles a small beak and should be made of sharp Indian iron.  The cutting should be done over many days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so as not to shake other teeth. But if it is projecting and firmly rooted, file it with a file made of Indian steel, whose image is this:
It should be entirely of Indian steel, its cutting edge very fine, like the file used to make needles. File the tooth little by little over many days gently, lest you shake the tooth and cause it to fall. Then file it again and remove it with some forceps.
If a tooth is broken and hurts the tongue when speaking, it should also be filed until the roughness of the fracture is removed, it becomes smooth, and it no longer hurts the tongue or impairs speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On binding loose teeth with silver or gold threads.
If the front teeth become loose and move due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on anything to eat lest they fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medications but the treatment has not worked,
the remedy is to bind them with a gold or silver thread, gold being preferable because silver tarnishes and decays after a few days, while gold remains unchanged forever; and the thread should be of medium fineness, according to what fits between the teeth.
The method of binding is to take the thread and insert its loop between the sound teeth, then weave the ends of the thread between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until you reach a sound tooth on the other side by weaving.
Then you return the weaving to the side where you began and pull gently and skillfully so that they do not move at all, and tighten the thread at the roots of the teeth lest it loosen; then cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors, gather them, twist them with a small drill, and hide them between the sound and loose teeth.
lest it injure the tongue; then leave it thus bound for as long as it remains; if it loosens or breaks, bind it with another thread, and he will enjoy it thus his whole life.  And this is an image of the teeth and the manner of binding in two sound teeth and two loose teeth as you see:
And one or two teeth may be returned to their place after falling out and bound as described and remain; this is done by a skilled craftsman, and he may carve bone from a cow and make it in the shape of a tooth and place it in the place from which the tooth fell. And it is tightened as we said, and it remains and he enjoys that.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
Concerning the cutting of the ligament which appears under the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament which appears under the tongue may be either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound which has healed.
The procedure is that you open the mouth of the patient and place his head in your lap and raise his tongue, then cut that nervous ligament transversely until the tongue is released from its restraint. If there is some rigidity and complexity, and that is from the healing of a wound, then insert a hook into it and split it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knots are loosened.
Beware that the incision is not deep into the flesh, lest you cut an artery there and bleeding results. Then, after the cutting, let him gargle with rose water or with vinegar and cold water, then place under the tongue a pledget of linen which the patient holds in place each night.
Lest it reunite. If bleeding occurs, place powdered alum on the place. If the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize the area with a suitable lentil-shaped cautery. Then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On the removal of a frog formed under the tongue.
A swelling resembling a small frog may occur under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function, and perhaps growing until it fills the mouth.  The procedure is to open the patient's mouth towards the sun and look at the swelling.
If you see it dark in color or black, hard and insensitive to the patient, do not interfere with it, for it is cancer. But if it is inclined to whiteness and moist, then pierce it with a probe and incise it with a fine scalpel, freeing it from every side.
If blood overwhelms you during your work, apply powdered alum until the bleeding stops, then return to your work until you remove it completely. Then have him gargle with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with other appropriate treatments until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
In the treatment of tonsil tumors.
And what grows in the throat from other tumors, glands may appear inside the throat similar to those that appear outside, called tonsils. If you treat them with what I mentioned in the section and they do not heal,
look, and if the tumor is hard, dark in color, and insensitive, do not approach it with an instrument. And if it is red in color and its base is thick, do not approach it with an instrument either, for fear of bleeding, but leave it until it matures, then either you may lance it or it may burst on its own.
And if it is white in color, round, and its base is thin, this is what should be cut.  The procedure is that you should look before operating whether its hot inflammation has completely subsided or diminished somewhat.
Then seat the patient facing the sun, his head in your lap, and open his mouth.  Have an assistant hold his tongue down with an instrument of this shape:
It is made of silver or copper, thin like a knife. When you press the tongue down with it and the tumor becomes visible, take a hook and insert it into the tonsil and pull it out as much as possible without pulling any of the membranes with it.
Then cut it with an instrument of this shape: it resembles scissors, except that its two ends are curved, and the edge of each is very sharp.  It is made of Indian iron or Damascus steel:
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a scalpel of this shape:
sharp on one side and not sharp on the other. After cutting one tonsil, cut the other in the same way. Then, after cutting, gargle the patient with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which pomegranate peel or myrtle leaves or similar astringents have been boiled until the bleeding stops. Then treat him until he recovers. Other tumors may grow in the throat besides the tonsils; cut them as described for the tonsils.
I treated a woman with a tumor that had grown inside her throat, resembling a polyp, somewhat insensitive, which nearly blocked the throat. The woman was breathing through a narrow passage and was prevented from eating and drinking water.
She was on the verge of death if she had remained for a day or two.  Two branches extended from the tumor until they emerged from her nostrils. I acted quickly, inserted a hook into one of them, and pulled; a suitable piece was extracted.
Then I cut it where I reached it through the nostril. I then did the same with what protruded from the other nostril.  Then I opened her mouth, depressed her tongue, and inserted the hook into the tumor itself, cutting some of it. Only a little blood flowed.
The woman's throat opened, and she immediately began to drink water and eat.  We repeatedly cut away parts of the tumor for a long time, the tumor replacing what was cut, until it lasted a long time for both of us.
Then I devised a plan and cauterized the tumor inside the throat with a cautery iron. It stopped growing. Then she traveled away, and I do not know what God did with her afterwards.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On cutting a uvular tumor.
That which is called a uvular tumor: if it descends as a swelling to the uvula and is white and oblong, it is called a column; and if it is thick below and round, it is called a grape. If it is treated with what we have mentioned in the classification and the treatment is not effective,
and I saw that the hot tumor had subsided from it and it was thin, then it should be cut, and whatever was gathered together, round, and did not have length, and was bloody or the color of pus, or black, or insensitive, then it should be avoided cutting it.
For there is danger to the patient. Therefore, if you see it in the manner which I mentioned, of its whiteness and length, then let the patient sit facing the sun, and compress his tongue with the instrument which I previously described, then insert the hook into the grape.
And pull it downwards and cut it with one of the two instruments which I mentioned in cutting the tonsils. And it is necessary not to cut from it except that which exceeds the natural state without excess, for if you cut more from it, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after the cutting, use what we described in cutting the tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient is afraid of cutting it, then it is necessary to use a method in cauterizing it without fear or caution, and the way of cauterization is with a sharp medicine, and that is to place the patient's head in your lap.
Then compress his tongue with the instrument which we mentioned, then take from the sharp water which I mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it with unquenched lime, and make it neither thick nor thin, and fill the concavity of this instrument with it, and this is its image:
Its end, in which you place the medicine, has a concavity like the concavity of a spoon, and you place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself, and the patient lying on his side so that the saliva flows from his mouth from inside his throat, lest anything descend from it into his throat and harm him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine while you squeeze it on the uvula for about half an hour until you see that it has blackened and the sting of the medicine has subsided. And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe and moisten the cotton in the medicine.
And insert the probe with the cotton into the tube from above until the cotton adheres to the uvula. Do this repeatedly until you achieve the desired cauterization of the uvula, then leave it; it will wither and fall off after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, reapply it.
After cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter and wipe away the medicine around it. Then gargle with cold water and treat externally with lotions and internally with gargles until it heals. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and further from fear.
The uvula may also be treated with something gentler than cautery and cutting; it is treated with fumigation in this manner: take fumitory, hyssop, thyme, rue, wormwood, chamomile, and betony, and similar herbs. Gather them all or some of them in a pot and submerge them in vinegar.
Boil it, the pot being coated with philosopher's clay, and there should be a hole in the middle of the lid into which a hollow instrument is fitted, made in this manner, of silver or copper:
Insert the end containing the pomegranate into the patient's mouth so that the steam rises to the uvula through the tube until the uvula is sufficiently steamed. Then repeat this several times until it withers. And beware of performing this treatment at the first onset of the swelling.
For it often increases the swelling. It should only be done when its hot swelling subsides. If you do not have this instrument, take a reed and fit an eggshell to its end, lest the patient's mouth be burned.
For the eggshell prevents the heat of the steam from burning the mouth, and this is a good treatment and safe.
Chapter thirty-eight.
On removing thorns and other things that lodge in the throat.
Often a bone or fishbone or something else lodges in the throat.  What is visible should be removed with the eye, after you have pressed down the tongue with an instrument towards the uvula.
So that you may see what is in the throat.  And if it does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, then you should make the patient vomit before his food is digested in his stomach, for perhaps the lodged thing will come out with the vomit, or the patient may swallow a piece of beet or a head of lettuce.
Or he may swallow a piece of dry bread, or you may take a piece of soft sea sponge and tie it to a string, then he swallows it; and when it reaches the place of the thorn, pull the string quickly.  Do this repeatedly.
Often the thorn or bone will stick to it and come out. If it does not come out by the means mentioned, then use a lead instrument of this shape:
It should be slightly thicker than a probe, and at its tip a hook. The patient inserts it into his throat gently, raising his head upwards, and taking care not to touch his windpipe, lest he cause coughing and push the bone or thorn further in; or the physician inserts it with his hand.
And the patient's insertion of it is better, for he knows the location of the lodged object, and he pushes downwards or pulls upwards with the instrument, all this as much as he is able, until it comes out.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On the removal of leeches lodged in the throat.
If you treat the leech with what we mentioned in the section on medical treatment, and it is ineffective, then look into the patient's throat in the sunlight, after you have pressed down his tongue with the instrument I described to you.
If you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook or with a soft, strong forceps; but if you cannot manage it otherwise, take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the leech, then insert into the tube an iron heated in the fire.
Do this several times, and the patient should abstain from water the whole day; then he should take a jug full of cold water, open his mouth into it, and rinse his mouth with it, without swallowing a drop, moving the water from time to time with his hand.
The leech will fall out immediately when it feels the water; but if it does not come out as described, fumigate the throat with urine and with galbanum with the instrument described in the fumigation of the tonsils; do this several times; it will fall out.
The method of fumigation is this: take a pot containing hot coals heated in the fire, the pot being covered with a lid in the middle of which is a hole; into this hole you fit the end of the instrument, then throw in the incense; the patient puts his mouth to the end of the tube, and closes his mouth so that the incense does not escape, until he knows that the incense has reached his throat.
Then the leech will fall out immediately; but if it does not, repeat the fumigation several times, and let the patient endure thirst, and eat salt and garlic, but drink no water; it must come out with this treatment.  And this is a picture of an instrument by which the leech is drawn from the throat when it is seen.
It resembles forceps, as you see, except that it has this curve which enters the throat, and its two ends resemble the beak of a bird; they are as rough as a file, so that when they grasp something, they do not let go.
And another instrument, by which the tongue is compressed; it is a wide iron ring, large enough to encompass the mouth above the tongue; it is inserted into the mouth standing on its side, so that the mouth remains open without the will of the patient, nor can he remove it at all until it is taken away.
The description of the instrument with which the mouth is opened in this very way.
Chapter Forty.
It will deal with the cauterization of tumors and their incision.
Tumors are numerous and varied in kind, as will be described one by one in this book, and they differ in their cauterization and incision in two respects: one, from the type of tumor itself and what it contains of humors.
And the second type is due to the locations in which they occur in the body, for a tumor occurring in the head is not the same as a tumor occurring in the rectum, and a tumor occurring in a fleshy location is not the same as a tumor occurring in a joint; each has its own ruling in treatment.
And some tumors should not be cauterized except after the pus in them has matured and become complete, while others should be cauterized while they are raw and have not fully matured, such as tumors that are near the joints.
For if a tumor occurs near a joint and its condition prolongs until it corrupts what is around it, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, and thus be the cause of the paralysis of that member; or the tumor may be near a vital organ.
For if you delay its cauterization until it matures, you will harm that vital organ; or it may be near the rectum, so cauterize it raw.  It is necessary to cauterize a raw tumor, not fully mature, which is near the rectum, lest it become putrid and penetrate into the rectum and become a fistula.
And it will reach a point where it does not heal. And you should know the time for cauterizing tumors that have fully matured, which is when the pain of the tumor subsides, the fever disappears, the redness and throbbing decrease, the head of the tumor softens, and all the other signs.
And you should apply the cauterization in the lowest possible part of the tumor if that is possible, so that the flow of the matter will be easier downwards, or in the thinnest and most prominent part of the tumor. And let the cauterization extend along the length of the body if the tumors are in the hands or feet.
And the places of the muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and in short, in all flat places which do not bend.  But those which bend, let the cauterization be applied according to that place.  And if the tumor is in fleshy places, it is best to leave it alone.
Until its maturation is complete, as we have said, for if you cauterize it before that, the pus will flow from it for a long time, and it will be very harmful and dirty, and perhaps its lips and base will harden. And some tumors may be cauterized across the body when necessary or according to what the member requires.
And you should use a single cauterization for small tumors and a wide cauterization or many incisions for large tumors, according to the size of the tumor. And there may be tumors which it is necessary to scrape the skin and cut if it has become like a rag.
And it has reached the point where it has died, like what happens in many abscesses and boils. And some of them are incised with a three-sided incision, and some of them are cut in the shape of an ivy leaf, like the inguinal tumor.
And some of them use a circular incision and a crescent-shaped incision and similar incisions. And what does not have a head, like smooth, flat tumors, it should only be cauterized simply.  And if the tumor is large and has gathered for a long time and you cauterize it, you should not rush to remove all the pus at that time.
Rather, remove some of it, then dress the tumor until another day, then remove some of the pus as well. Do this repeatedly gradually until you remove all of it.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old man, for the vital spirit often dissolves with the sudden removal of pus, so the patient may die and you do not realize it. Therefore, beware of this matter greatly.
After cauterizing these tumors, you should wipe the wound and look. If the wound of the tumor is small, or the incision is single and simple, then use a thread of linen or old cotton.  And if the tumor is large and the incisions of the cautery are many,
then you should insert a tent into each incision until some of them reach each other. And if some of the skin of the tumor has been cut or excised, then you should pack it with old cotton or linen lint without moisture and dress it until the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar, after having soaked a linen cloth in them, and apply it to the bleeding site repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, you should use the measures, treatment, and styptics that we have described in many places in this book and in the division. If you are in winter and the location of the tumor is very nervous, then you should moisten the bandages with a warm drink and oil.
And place them on the location. And if you are in summer and the locations are fleshy, then you should apply the bandages soaked in water and oil or in a drink and oil, all of that cold, until the third day, as we said. Then you should unwrap the tumor and wipe it.
And use similar things in its treatment until it heals. This is what you need to know about the general treatment of tumors. As for the detailed method, I have mentioned for each tumor how to treat it, categorized and summarized.
Chapter forty-one.
On the incision of tumors that appear in the scalp.
Small tumors appear in the scalp; they are types of boils contained within sacs, which have conditions like a chicken’s crop, and their types are many.  Some are fatty, and some contain a moisture resembling mud.
And some contain a moisture resembling pus and broth and the like, and some are hardened and solid.  There is no danger in incising and removing all of them, unless you encounter an artery when incising them.
The procedure for incising them is to first probe them with the instrument whose image comes after this, which is called the *madass*, until you know what it contains. If what it contains is moisture, then incise it lengthwise with a simple incision in this manner:
Begin the incision from point B to point C. When the moisture is evacuated, remove the sac that contained that moisture and cut it all away, leaving nothing of it at all, for it often returns if any of it remains.
Then dip cotton in yellow ointment, if available, otherwise in salt water, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day, for it will eat away what remains of the sac. Then apply the cotton with the yellow ointment again, a second and third time, if needed.
Until you are certain that nothing of the sac remains. Then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. And if the tumor contains a fatty substance, incise it in this manner:
Make a cruciform incision and hook the hooks into the lips of the wound and strip it from every side and do your best to remove the peritoneum that contains it. If an artery obstructs you, do what I described to you afterwards.  And do likewise in the tumor if it is hardened from the incision.
The treatment is the same as I mentioned. The incision on the hardened tumor is easier because it has little blood and moisture.  Some of these tumors which are in the head in some people may have no moisture at all.  For I incised a tumor in…
the head of an old woman and I found the tumor like hard, rough, white stone. It was impossible to break it, and if someone were to throw it, it would cut him. And it was not like other tumors occurring in the head, other than these, like the tumors that appear in the heads of children.
And at the roots of the ears, incise them all with a simple incision and make their bottoms from their lowers so that the flow of the matter to the bottom is easy, then treat them with what suits them of treatment.
Chapter forty-two.
Concerning the incision on the swellings which frequently appear in the neck. These tumors frequently appear in the neck and under the armpits and in the groins, and may appear in the rest of the body. That which appears in the neck may be one or many, and some may develop from others.
And every swelling of them is within a special sac, as is the case in the abscesses and tumors of the head as we have described, and the types of these swellings are many; some are hardened, and some contain fluids, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
So I saw that which was good in condition to the touch, and its exterior was near to the color of the skin, it moved to every direction, and it was not attached to a nerve of the neck, nor to a vein, nor to an artery, nor was it sunken. Then it should be incised with a simple incision from above to below the body in this manner, from line J to line B.
And you should dissect it from every side and stretch the lips of the skin with a hook or two hooks or many hooks if you need that, as we said in the tumors of the head, and you remove it little by little and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and let the scalpel not be very sharp.
Lest your hand increase the cutting or the patient be troubled, and you cut what you do not need to cut.  If you cut a vein or an artery and it hinders you from working, then place in the wound powdered verdigris or some of the things that stop blood.
And tighten the wound and leave it until the intensity of the swelling subsides and the wound relaxes and begins to fester, for the blood will then stop. Then return to your work until you finish, then examine with your index finger if there remains anything, then small other growths, and cut them and clean them.
If there is a large vein at the root of the growth, then it should not be cut from its root, but it should be tied with a doubled tight thread and left until it falls off by itself without harm, then you stuff the wound with old cotton that has been soaked in Egyptian ointment, then you treat it.
And if you cut the growth entirely, then you should bring together the lips of the wound and stitch it immediately after you know that no residue remains. If you see that some residue of the bone of the growth remains,
then you should aim to cut to its root and base and use sutures and what we have mentioned. And as for any of the growths that contain fluids, lance them slightly where their ripening appears, and make the lance from the lower side as we said.
Then after lancing, use a dressing with Egyptian ointment or the like to eat away what remains of the corruption until, when you see the wound is clean, treat it with ointments that grow flesh until it heals.
Chapter forty-three.
On the incision of the throat for a tumor that occurs inside the throat.
The ancients mentioned this incision in the throat, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it. This is the account of their words. As for those with angina, they should avoid an incision in the throat, for they will not benefit from it.
Because all the veins and the lung will be diseased. But those who have a hot tumor in the mouth or throat or tonsils, if there is no disease in the trachea, then it is necessary to use an incision of the throat to escape the harm which results from suffocation.
Then, if we want to do this, we should incise the throat below three or four rings of the trachea, a small transverse incision between two rings, to the extent of the incision in the peritoneum, not in the cartilage. This place is suitable for the incision.
Because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are distant from it. If the physician is cowardly, he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, then incise the skin until he reaches the trachea, avoiding the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should incise the peritoneum which we have described. He will know the incision of the trachea from the phlegm which comes out of it, along with whatever is punctured, and from the interruption of the voice.  The wound is left open for a time.  When the time in which suffocation was feared has passed, the edges of the wound are joined together with skin.
And its outline is separate from the cartilage. Then apply medicines which cause the growth of flesh until it heals.  The author of this book said: The explanation of this statement which we have narrated is only if they see that the patient's throat is obstructed by one of these tumors which they mentioned.
And the patient is close to death and his breath is about to cease, they proceed to incise the throat so that the patient breathes through the wound, breathes somewhat, and is saved from death.  They are ordered to leave the wound open until the intensity of the illness subsides, its intensity being three days or thereabouts.
Then they are ordered to suture the wound and treat it until it heals. What I have witnessed myself is that a maidservant took a knife and plunged it into her throat, cutting some of the trachea. I was called to treat her, and I found her collapsing like one who is slaughtered. So I uncovered the wound.
I found that the blood which came out of the wound was slight, so I was certain that she had not cut a vein nor an artery, and air was coming out of the wound.  So I proceeded, I sutured the wound, and treated it until it healed.  Nothing happened to the maidservant except for hoarseness in her voice, and nothing more.
And after days she returned to her best condition. From this, we say that incision of the throat is not dangerous.
Chapter forty-four.
Concerning the incision on the tumor which appears in the throat from the outside and is called the throat elephant.
This tumor which is called the throat elephant is a large tumor, the color of the body. It is frequent in women and is of two types.
Either it is natural or accidental. As for the natural, there is no remedy for it; as for the accidental, it is of two kinds: one resembling fatty swellings, and the other resembling the tumor which results from the complication of the artery, and its incision is dangerous. Therefore, one should not at all use the iron on them except what is small of them, if you probe and examine it with a probe and find that it resembles a fatty swelling and is not attached to anything of the veins; then incise it as you incise on swellings. And remove it with its containing sac if it is in a sac; otherwise, remove all of it, then treat the place with what is appropriate of treatment.
Chapter forty-five.
Concerning the incision of various swellings.
Swellings are numerous in types, and I have mentioned all their types in the classification. It is necessary to explain here the difference between a swelling and an abscess, since it is difficult.  I say that with an abscess there is heat and fever and frightening pains until the boiling of the matter subsides. And the putrefaction is completed, then the fever and the intensity subside.  A swelling is not accompanied by heat, fever or pain, and it is contained in a serous sac, which is its special container. It is the color of the body, and its beginning is like a lentil, and it becomes like a blister, larger or smaller.
And it is of two types: either fatty, or containing moisture. The colors of the moisture are many, as I mentioned in the classification. Therefore, when you come to treat a swelling, you should probe and examine it first with the instrument called the probe, whose image comes in the chapter after this.
Assess the size of the swelling, then remove the probe and look at what comes out after it. If flowing moisture of any color comes out, then incise it with a simple incision as I mentioned in the case of other swellings. If no moisture comes out after the probe, then know that it is fatty.
Then make a firm incision on it in this manner as I have taught you, and hang it with hooks.  Peel the skin from every side gently, and preserve the sac if you can so that you remove it whole with the swelling.
If the sac is perforated during the procedure and you cannot remove it whole—and this often happens—then remove it piece by piece until nothing remains. For if any part remains, however small or large, the swelling will return in most cases.
If it overcomes you and a little remains, cauterize the wound when you have finished with some sharp cauterizing points, and tighten the wound.  Place on top of it something that soothes hot swelling and treat it with other treatments until it heals. If the swelling is large, suture its lips and treat it with what unites [the wound].
If you encounter a bleeding or non-bleeding vein and bleeding occurs, quickly cauterize the area with powdered vitriol and leave it constricted for two or three days until the wound becomes infected and the flow of blood stops.  Then return to removing what remains of the swelling.
Chapter Forty-six.
On the forms of instruments.
Those which are used in incision and cautery:  the forms of probes, of which there are three types: large, medium, and small.
Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
They are made of tempered iron, square-ended and smooth, to facilitate entry into tumors. These are images of probes, called *bard*, and there are also three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
It is suitable for exploring tumors, wounds, fistulas, and cavities for what is inside them of bone and other things.  It is made round, polished, and smooth like spatulas, of Chinese copper, or of spadata, or of copper, or of iron, or of silver; the best are those made of spadata.
Probes may also be made of lead, and are suitable for exploring fistulas which have tortuous paths, because their softness allows them to conform to such tortuosity. These also come in three types: long, medium, and short.
According to the needs of each fistula, its thickness should be made to fit the width and narrowness of the fistula. Image of a large lead probe.
Image of a medium-sized lead probe.
Image of a small lead probe.
Images of hooks.  They are of many types: some are simple, meaning they have one hook, and these come in three sizes: large, medium, and small; some are blind hooks, and these also come in three sizes; some are double hooks, and these come in three sizes; and some are curved double hooks. And these come in three types.  There are also hooks with three hooks, and these also come in three types. Each of these types is needed in its place. Image of a large simple hook. Image of a medium simple hook. Image of a small simple hook.
Image of a large blind hook. Image of a medium blind hook.
Image of a small blind hook.
Image of a large hook with two hooks. Image of a medium hook with two hooks. Image of a small hook with two hooks.
Image of a large hook with three hooks.
Image of a medium hook with three hooks. Image of a small hook with three hooks.
And these are images of the scalpels with which the sores and tumors are incised and flayed.  They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large scalpel.
Image of a medium scalpel.
Image of a small scalpel.
Their blades, with which it is incised, are sharpened, and the other ends are not sharpened but rather made thus so that they may be used in flaying the sore when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and so that the patient may be comfortable and find some relief from the burning which he feels when the tumor is flayed.
And these are images of the probes. They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large probe.
It is made of copper, similar to the probe with which one applies kohl, and at one end is something like a broad spoon of two layers, which has in its head a hidden scalpel blade resembling a bird's tongue, which moves in and out as desired, as you see.
Images of the scalpels which are inserted between the fingers when lancing tumors, so that the patient does not feel them. They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large scalpel.
Images of the cupping instruments with which blood is drawn.  They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of the large cupping instrument.
They are made of copper or china, slightly elongated as you see, and are thin.  It is necessary that you have these types of cupping instruments, large and small, to draw blood quickly when necessary and when you do not have medicine at hand.
But it is not used to draw blood from every part of the body, but rather it is used in fleshy parts, such as the muscles of the leg and thigh, the muscles of the arm, the breast, the abdomen, the groin, and similar moist fleshy members.
And other small instruments may be made from them, resembling pistachio shells, in this manner:
Blood is drawn with them if it flows from a place of phlebotomy, or when a vein or artery is cut, and they may be made round in this manner:

On the treatment of men's breasts.
The breasts of some people may swell at the age of puberty until they resemble the breasts of women, remaining swollen and unsightly.  He who dislikes this should make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast in this manner.
From line B to line C. Then remove all the fat, then fill the wound with cauterizing medicine, then join the edges of the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals. If the breast leans downward and becomes flaccid due to its size, as happens to women,
it should be incised on its upper sides with two crescent-shaped incisions, each connected to the other at their ends, so that the larger line encircles the smaller one, in this manner: From line B to line C, then remove the skin between the incisions and remove the fat, and use what we have mentioned of sutures and cauterizations and whatever treatment is needed until it heals.
If you cannot remove what should be removed because of the patient's anxiety or because of bleeding, then you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in caustic ointment and leave it until it consumes the remaining fat, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter forty-eight.
On the treatment of tumors that appear under the armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of the type of hard warts contained in a sac, and some contain fluids.  As for those containing fluids, an incision should be made in a crescent shape in this manner.
from line B to line C.  Then, if all the fluid in the tumor is evacuated, pack it with old cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the type of knotted warts, make an incision on it as we mentioned in the incision on warts. If the wound persists to the point that pus spreads, use cauterization as we mentioned previously.
Chapter forty-nine.
On incising the tumor that appears near the artery or vein, called aneurysma.
If the artery is injured and the skin over it heals, a tumor often results from this; similarly, a vein may also develop a swelling and tumor.
The signs by which one knows whether the tumor and swelling are from an artery or a vein: if the tumor is from an artery, it is oblong, situated deep in the body, and if you press the tumor with your finger, you feel as if it has a murmur.
That which is from a vein, the tumor is round, on the surface of the body, and incision of these tumors is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many other places of the body, and when they are very large; therefore, one should avoid treating them with iron.
And those also in the extremities or in the head should be avoided. As for those that are a swelling of the mouth of the artery, incise it in the skin lengthwise, then open the incision with hooks, then strip the artery and free it from the membranes.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle underneath and pass it to the other side, and tie the artery with a doubled thread in two places, as I have shown you in ligating the two arteries in the temples, then incise with a scalpel the area between the ligatures until all the blood in it comes out.
And the tumor will resolve, then you use treatment that produces pus until the ligatures fall off, then you treat it with suitable ointments until it heals.
If the tumor is from a vein incision, then you should grasp with your hand as much of the tumor as possible together with the skin, then insert a needle below the place you grasped with your hand and pass it, with a doubled thread in it, until you bring it out from the other side. Then tie the tumor tightly with it, according to what I mentioned to you in tying the uvula from both sides with the ends of the thread. If you fear that the threads will slip, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole tumor at the intersection of the first needle.
And tighten your threads in four places, then incise the tumor in its middle until what is in it comes out. Then cut away the excess skin and leave what was tied. Then apply a pledget that you have soaked in a drink and oil. Then use treatment with cauterization and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On the tumor which occurs from the twisting of a nerve.
Just as a tumor occurs in an artery and a vein, so a tumor occurs in a nerve if a blow occurs in it or it occurs from excessive fatigue or the like. And this is most common in the wrists and heels.
And in every place where the joints move, it is a firm tumor resembling in color the rest of the body. It is, in most cases, painless.  If pressed firmly, the patient feels a kind of numbness.  The tumor is not located deep within the body.
Rather, it is under the skin and moves in every direction, but does not extend forward or backward. As for those in the joints, they should not be treated with iron, for it may cause paralysis. And as for those in the head or forehead…
Incise the skin with a scalpel. If the tumor is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it from its base. If it is large, hook it with a hook and strip it off, then remove it and close the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-One.
Concerning the excision of warts which appear in the abdomen.
Often, some people develop warts on their abdomens and other parts of their bodies, called fungal warts because of their resemblance to mushrooms. Their base is thin and their head is thick; their lips may be transformed, and some are small while others become very large.
I once saw a man who had two warts on his abdomen that most resembled mushrooms; they were white, thin at the base, their lips had been transformed and cracked, and moisture constantly flowed from them.  I excised them; one weighed about eighteen ounces, and the other about six ounces.
In excising them, observe: if the patient is moist and the wart is white, moist, and thin at the base, excise it with a wide scalpel, and have cauteries ready in the fire, for often a great deal of blood gushes forth when they are cut.
If the bleeding overwhelms you, cauterize it immediately. If you see that the patient is cowardly and frightened by cutting with iron, take a strong lead thread and tie it tightly around the wart of this description, and leave it for two days, then increase the tightness of the lead, continuing to tighten it.
Keep tightening it until it affects the wart so that it is severed and falls off by itself without effort. If the wart is thick at the base, there is some fear and risk in cutting it, especially if it is in the abdomen; however, it is possible to cut half of it or part of it.
Then cauterize it lest it return, and then treat it until the wound heals. Beware of attempting to cut a wart that is dark in color, insensitive, and foul-looking, for it is a cancerous tumor, and we shall describe cancer later.
Chapter fifty-two.
In the treatment of an umbilical polyp.
An umbilical polyp results from many causes: either from a rupture of the peritoneum of the abdomen, from which fat or intestine protrudes, as occurs in other hernias; or from blood emitted from a vein or artery, as previously described; or from gas that collects there.
If it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum and protrusion of fat, then the tumor will be similar in color to the body, soft, painless, and of varying appearance. If it is due to the protrusion of intestine, its appearance will be more varied than we have described. If you press it with your fingers, it disappears and then returns; sometimes it is accompanied by gurgling and increases greatly with the use of the bath and strenuous exertion. If it is due to moisture, it will be soft.
It does not disappear when pressed with your hand, nor does it increase or decrease. If it is due to blood, in addition to these signs, the tumor appears dark. If it is due to newly grown flesh, the tumor will be firm, hard, and remain at a constant size.
If it is due to gas, it will be soft to the touch.  The treatment is as follows: If the umbilical polyp is due to arterial or venous blood or gas, you should refrain from treating it, as this is dangerous and risky, as I explained in the chapter where I discussed tumors arising from arteries and veins.
If the umbilical protrusion is due to intestine or fat, you should instruct the patient to hold his breath and stand erect, then apply a ligature around the entire umbilicus. Then instruct him to lie on his back before you. Then incise with a broad scalpel around the umbilicus at the place you marked with the ligature. Then pull the center of the tumor upwards with a large forceps and tie the incised area with a strong thread or silk tendon tightly.
The knot of the ligature should be a slip knot. Then open the center of the tightened tumor above the ligature and insert your index finger. Seek the intestine; if you find that the ligature has grasped it, loosen the slip knot and push the intestine back into the abdomen. If you find fat, pull it out with forceps.
And cut off its excess. If you encounter an artery or vein, ligate it carefully and return to your work. Take two needles and thread them with strong threads. Insert the needles into the incision you made around the tumor, crossing them, having passed them through. Then tie the tumor in four places over the needles.
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the constricted flesh mortifies and falls off by itself, or cut it off when it becomes soft and mortified. Then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals. If the umbilical protrusion is from flesh that has grown there,
or from moisture, it is necessary to constrict the tumor as we said and evacuate the blood or moisture that you find in it, then treat it with what will close the wound.
Chapter fifty-three.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and the way to treat it with medication and the warning against treating it with iron, lest it ulcerate, and we have mentioned the cancer that develops in the womb and the warning against treating it.
And the ancients mentioned that if the cancer is in a place where it can all be excised, like the cancer that is in the breast or in the thigh and similar accessible organs, to remove it entirely, especially if it is small and beginning; but if it is old and large, it should not be approached.
For I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve that, and the procedure, if it is accessible as we said, is to first purge the patient with black bile several times, then to bleed him if there is evident fullness in the veins.
Then you position the patient in a position that allows for the procedure, then you apply to the cancer hooks suitable for it, then you scrape it from every side together with the skin completely, until nothing of its roots remains, and let the blood flow and do not stop it quickly.
Rather, squeeze the areas and drain all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever instruments you can, and if during the procedure you encounter profuse bleeding from a severed artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter fifty-four.
On the treatment of fistula.
We have already described in the classification the types of dropsy, how the accumulation of water occurs, and the signs of each type and its treatment with medication.  That which is treated with cautery is only the ascitic type, and the tympanitic type and the fleshy type are not at all approached with cautery.
For that is deadly, if you have treated this type of ascitic fistula with medication and your treatment has not been effective, then look, for if the patient is extremely weak or has another illness besides the fistula, such as…
a cough or diarrhea or the like, then beware of treating him with cautery, for that is dangerous.  If you see that the patient is strong, without any illness other than the fistula alone, and is neither a child nor an old man, then the procedure is that you should make the patient stand before you. and an attendant behind him should press his abdomen with his hands and push the water downwards towards the pubic region, then take a pointed scalpel of this form:
pointed at both ends, long, and with a sharp point like a scalpel, except that it has a slight curve so that it does not penetrate the intestine during the procedure and injure it. Then look, if the fistula originates from the intestine…
then it is necessary that you make the incision three fingerbreadths below the navel in line with it above the pubis. If the fistula originated from liver disease, let your incision be three fingerbreadths to the left of the navel; if it originated from spleen disease, let the incision be on the right side by three fingerbreadths.
Also, the incision should not be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie down, lest the fluids flow to that weak area. Then pierce the whole skin with the instrument, and then insert the instrument into the incision and raise your hand.
with the scalpel between the skin and the peritoneum, as if you are flaying it, and the amount you flay should be about the size of a fingernail or so. Then pierce the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches an empty space, which is the location of the water, then remove it and insert into the opening the instrument of this form:
It is like a tube made of a thin reed, made of silver or copper or smooth, polished lead. It has a small opening at its lower end, and three openings at its sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And it may have its end sharpened in the shape of a pen nib, in this form:
At its upper end is a ring; if the instrument reaches the water, it will immediately flow down onto the instrument, and you will evacuate a moderate amount of water at a time. For if you evacuate more than is necessary at one time, the patient may die from the dissolution of his animal spirit.
Or he may experience a faintness approaching death. But evacuate according to his strength and what the patient's condition indicates to you from the strength of his pulse and the good color of his complexion. Then remove the instrument and the water will be retained, for it will be retained immediately.
Because of the skin which covers the opening in the peritoneum which I have told you to prepare in that manner. Then you may reinsert the instrument another day if you see the patient is able to tolerate it.
And you will also evacuate a small amount of water, doing this for several days while you remain vigilant and guard against error, until only a little water remains. If you fear for the patient and leave a large amount of water, treat him by burying him in hot sand.
And profuse sweating in the bath and sun, and making him endure thirst, and treating him with drying medicines until he is cured.  And cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after evacuating the water as I have described above.
Chapter Fifty-Five.
In the treatment of children who are born with their urinary passages imperforate, or with a narrow or misplaced opening.
Some boys may be born with their urethra imperforate, and it is necessary to immediately puncture it at birth.
With a very fine scalpel, in this manner:
Then place a thin lead nail in the opening, and bind and secure it for three or four days.  When he wishes to urinate, remove it, and after urination, replace it. If you do not use lead, it is possible that the urine flowing to the place will not allow it to close.
As for one whose opening is narrow, it is treated with lead as we said for many days until it widens.  Those whose opening is misplaced—for some are born with the opening at the end of the penis and cannot urinate forward—
...so that he raises the urethra upwards with his hand, and it is not previously generated because the semen cannot reach the uterus in a straight line, and this is a very ugly condition. The method of treatment is that the patient lies on his back.
Then stretch his penis with your left hand with strong force, and incise the tip of the urethra with a sharp blade or scalpel, like a pen nib, or as if you are carving something so that its middle is prominent, similar to a penis, and the opening is located in the middle as it should be.
And be careful during your work to avoid bleeding, for this often occurs; therefore, stop the bleeding with appropriate measures, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
Concerning the ulcer that appears in the foreskin and penis, and blackness, corruption, and adhesion of the foreskin to the penis.
This ulcer often appears in the urethra; it is a fleshy, rough growth, and there are benign and malignant types.  The benign type should be tied off with a fine ligature.
And cut it until you remove it entirely, then apply a cotton swab soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it afterwards with palm ointment until it heals. But if the ulcer is malignant and dark in color, you should cauterize it after cutting and excising it.
If the ulcer is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised man, and part of the ulcer is inside the foreskin and part outside, you should remove the inner part first, until it heals; then treat the outer part.
Because if you treat both at the same time, you risk perforation of the foreskin.  Blackness and corruption may also appear in the labia and foreskin; you should excise everything that is black and tending towards, or already corrupted.
Then apply honey mixed with crushed and sifted pomegranate peel and acacia, then treat it with other remedies until it heals. If bleeding occurs, cauterize it with a crescent-shaped cautery iron of this shape:
Cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, namely bleeding and a corrupted wound. If the glans is eroded and completely destroyed at some point, you should insert a lead tube into the urethra so that the patient can urinate through it. As for the adhesion of the foreskin to the glans...
This adhesion occurs in those whose foreskin is intact and who have not been circumcised.  It may also result from a wound or swelling. You should separate it with a blunt scalpel until the bond is broken and the glans is freed on all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them upon close examination, you should remove some of the glans and some of the foreskin.  The foreskin is thin, so it may quickly perforate due to its thinness. Then separate the foreskin from the glans with a thin linen cloth soaked in cold water, lest they adhere again.
Then treat with an astringent drink until it heals.
Chapter fifty-seven.
On the cleansing of boys and the treatment of what may befall them.
Circumcision is nothing other than the separation of a connection like other wounds, except that since it is done by our will and is especially used in boys, it is necessary that we describe the best procedure for it.
And the easiest path leading to safety.  I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not used in their laws, but rather it is something we have acquired.
by experience.  And that is because I found the majority of surgeons and barbers use purification with the scalpel and with scissors, and they use the cautery and ligature with thread and cutting with the fingernail. I have tried all of these methods.
So I found nothing better than purification with scissors and ligature with thread, because purification with the scalpel often adheres to the skin, because the skin of the foreskin is in two layers, so perhaps the upper layer of skin is cut and the lower layer remains.
so it is necessary to cut again and renewed pain.  And purification with the cautery does not prevent cutting the end of the urethra, because it may enter its hole. And as for purification with the fingernail, perhaps the skin slips and your work is spoiled or the boy's skin is naturally short...
so they are often born like that and do not need purification, and I have seen that. As for purification with scissors and ligature with thread, experience has revealed its advantage to me because the scissors are proportionate in cutting, because the blade above is like the blade below.
So when you press your hand with the proportion of the two blades, you cut with one measurement and in one time, so the rein of the thread becomes like a wall for the skin of the urethra from all sides, with no mistake at all. And the way of working first is to reassure the boy.
Especially if he is one who understands a little that you are only tying the thread in his urethra and leaving him until another day, then rejoice him and please him in every way you can, and what he accepts with his mind, then make him stand upright before you.
And let him not be sitting, and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy's eye does not fall upon them at all, nor on any of the instruments, then you insert your hand into his urethra and inflate the skin and lift it upwards until the head of the urethra comes out.
Then you cleanse it from what gathers in it of filth, then tie the marked place with a doubled thread, then tie a second ligature a little below it, then grasp with your thumb and forefinger the place of the lower ligature firmly, and cut between the two ligatures. Then raise the skin upwards quickly and bring out the head of the urethra, then let the blood flow a little, for it is better and lessens the swelling of the urethra, then wipe it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some ash of burnt dry gourd, for it is the best I have tried, or fine wheat flour, for it is also excellent.
Then raise the skin upwards quickly and bring out the head of the urethra, then let the blood flow a little, for it is better and lessens the swelling of the urethra, then wipe it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some ash of burnt dry gourd, for it is the best I have tried, or fine wheat flour, for it is also excellent. Then apply on the testicles from above a compress of a cooked white egg in rose water, beaten with fresh, good rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
And this is the image of the scissors which are suitable for circumcision:
They should be sharp, cutting, not crooked, with smooth nails, and the length of the two blades should be equal to the length of the two handles.  As for the mistake that occurs in circumcision, it may be that the inner skin is entirely or partially inverted during the cutting; therefore you should extend it at once with your fingernail before the place swells.
And cut it evenly; if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it with a thread and cut it. If three days have passed and what is under the head of the urethra remains swollen and inflamed, then leave it until the hot swelling subsides and then remove it gently.
And cut it as seems best to you, and be careful of the head of the urethra, for if something of the head of the urethra is cut, it does not harm, so treat it with what heals the wound from the [medicinal] plants which we described in the chapter on plants.
And if some of the skin is cut beyond the proper amount and it retracts upwards, that also does not harm much, so treat it as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter fifty-eight.
In the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Urine retained in the bladder is due to its obstruction by a stone, or clotted blood, or pus, or a growing flesh, and the like.  If you treat that with what we have mentioned of the types of treatment described in the classification.
And if the urine does not flow, and you see that its retention is because of a stone which has become lodged in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that the patient should sit on his knees, then let someone mount his back and press his abdomen towards his back, and let the patient hold himself as much as he can.
Then the neck of the bladder will be forced to push the stone backwards, and the urine will flow. If it does not flow by what we have mentioned, and the matter becomes severe for the patient, then it is necessary that you use its extraction with the instrument called a catheter, whose image is this:
It is made of silver and is thin, smooth, hollow like a bird's feather in thinness and length, about a span and a half, with a gentle funnel at its head. The method of drawing off the urine with it is that you take a doubled thread and tie to its end wool or cotton firmly.
And insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the catheter, and cut with scissors if any of the wool remains so that it enters the tube and stops it like a stopper. Then anoint the catheter with oil or butter or egg white, and seat the patient on a chair.
And cleanse his bladder and penis with moist ointments or oil and lukewarm water. Then gently insert the catheter into the urethra until it reaches the root of the urethra, then bend the urethra upwards towards the navel, and then push the catheter inside.
Until the urethra is completely bent, then push the catheter inside until, when it reaches near the rectum, incline the penis downwards with the catheter inside it, and then push it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels that it has reached something hollow.
This is done in this manner because the passage through which the urine flows is tortuous. Then gently pull the thread with the wool, and the urine will follow the wool, then remove it and the urine will flow out, and replace the catheter.
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter fifty-nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
And the instruments suitable for this are made of silver or hollow ivory, having a long, thin tube like a pus-cannula; and if you wish to instill liquids and medicines, this is done with an instrument called a syringe, and this is its image:.
It is made of silver or hollow ivory, having a long tube as thin as a millet stalk, hollow throughout except for the tip, which is solid and has three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And the hollow part in which the propellant is, should be only large enough to contain it, without excess, so that when you draw something up with it, it will be drawn up, and when you push it, it will be pushed out, in the same way as the squirt which is used to throw oil in naval battles.
And if you wish to introduce liquids into the bladder, you insert the tip of the syringe into the liquid and draw it upwards with the piston; then the liquid will be drawn up into the body of the syringe. Then insert its tip into the urethra, as we described in the catheters, then push the liquid with the piston.
Then that liquid will reach the bladder immediately, so that the patient feels it. And this is the image of a fine clyster also, with which the bladder is injected:
It is made of silver or lead, its upper end resembling a small funnel, and below it a groove in which the ligature lies. Then you take a camel's bladder and put into it the liquid you wish to inject into the bladder, then tie it tightly between the two parts with a doubled thread.
And warm that liquid a little over the fire, then insert the tip of the clyster into the urethra, then press your hand firmly on the bladder containing the liquid until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder, take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it, and pierce it all around. Then insert a strong thread into these holes as they go around, then gather the circle as you gather a cloth, after putting in it whatever you want of liquids, ointments and water.
Then tie it to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, squeezing with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On the Extraction of Stones.
We have already mentioned in the classification the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and described the difference between stones generated in the kidneys and stones generated in the bladder, and the signs of all that, and mentioned the stones in which action by hand and incision is necessary.
These are the stones generated specifically in the bladder, and those which become lodged in the urethra; and I am describing this with clear explanation and brevity.
I say that stones generated in the bladder most often affect boys, and among their signs is that urine passes from the bladder resembling water in its thinness.
And sand appears in it, and he scratches his penis and plays with it, and it often hangs down, then spreads, and the anus protrudes with it in many of them.  It is easy to treat in boys until they reach fourteen years of age, and difficult in old men; as for young men, it is intermediate between these.
And the one whose stone is larger, his treatment is easier, and the small ones are the opposite.  If we proceed to treatment, then it is necessary first that the patient be given an enema to remove all the excrement in his intestines, for it may prevent the finding of the stone upon examination.
Then the patient is taken by his feet, and he is shaken and jolted downwards so that the stone descends to the neck of the bladder, or he jumps from a high place several times. Then seat him between your hands upright, with his hands under his thighs, so that the entire bladder is tilted downwards, then examine him.
And feel it from the outside. If you feel the stone in the space, then immediately proceed to incise it. If it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary to lubricate the index finger with oil from the left hand if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger.
If he is a fully developed boy, then insert it into his anus and search for the stone until, when it falls under your finger, you move it little by little to the neck of the bladder. Then press on it with your finger and push it outwards towards the place you want to incise.
And you order a servant to press the bladder with his hand, and you order another servant to stretch the labia upwards with his right hand, and with his other hand to stretch the skin under the labia towards the place where the incision will be. Then take the sharp scalpel, whose image is this:
And incise between the anus and the labia, not in the middle, but towards the left side of the anus.  The incision should be upon the stone itself, with your finger in the rectum, and you pressing it outwards obliquely, so that the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, to the extent that allows the stone to exit.
Not larger, for perhaps the finger in the rectum will press the stone during the incision, and it will exit without difficulty. And know that there may be stones which have angles and edges, making their exit difficult because of that.
And some are smooth, resembling an acorn and round, making their exit easy.  As for those that have angles and edges, enlarge the incision a little. If it does not exit like this, then you should try to grasp it with a firm forceps, the end of which is like a file.
To grasp the stone firmly so that it does not escape, or else insert a delicate instrument with a hooked end underneath it.  If you cannot manage it, widen the incision slightly.  If you are overcome by blood, staunch it with alum.
If there is more than one, push the largest first towards the opening of the bladder, then incise upon it, then push the smaller ones afterwards.  Do likewise if there are more than two. If it is very large, it is foolish to make a large incision upon it, for it exposes the patient to one of two things.
Either death, or a constant dribbling of urine because the wound will not heal at all. But try to push it out, or try to break it with forceps until you remove it in pieces.
When you have finished your work, dress the wound with costus, aloes, and myrrh, and bind it. Place over it rags moistened with oil and wine, or with rose ointment and cold water, to calm the hot inflammation. Then let the patient lie on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When it is loosened, wash the area with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with palm ointment and basil ointment until it heals. If excessive hot inflammation, gangrene, or the like, appears in the wound, such as blood clotting in the bladder and preventing urination—which is known by the passage of blood with urine—
insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will lead to corruption and decay of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type of problem with a suitable remedy until it heals.
Throughout the treatment, it is necessary to bind and draw together the thighs to secure the medications applied to the area. If the stone is small and has lodged in the urinary canal, preventing the passage of urine, treat it as I have described before resorting to incision.
I have often dispensed with incision by means of this treatment, which I have tested.  It consists of taking a steel probe of this shape:
The tip is triangular, sharp, and fixed in a shaft; then take a thread and tie the penis below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder, then gently insert the probe into the urethra until the probe reaches the stone itself.
And turn the probe in the stone little by little, aiming to pierce it until it passes through to the other side, whereupon the urine will immediately flow. Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from outside the penis, for it will break up and exit with the urine, and the patient will recover.
If this treatment is not feasible due to some impediment, tie a thread below the stone and another above it; then incise over the stone in the penis itself between the two threads and remove it.
Then untie the ligature and clean the clotted blood from the wound.  The reason for tying the thread below the stone is to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other above, so that when the thread is untied after the stone's removal, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should pull the skin upwards so that it returns and covers the wound as we have said.
Chapter sixty-one.
On the removal of stones from women.
Stones rarely develop in women.  If a woman does develop a stone, its treatment is difficult and impossible for many reasons. One is that the woman may be a virgin, and another is that you will rarely find a woman who allows herself to be examined by a physician.
If she is chaste or one of his close relatives, and thirdly, you will not find a woman skilled in this craft, especially in manual work, and fourthly, the incision site for stones in women is far from the stone itself, requiring a deep incision.
And in that there is danger. If necessity demands it, then a skilled female physician should be sought, but they are rarely found. If you cannot find one, seek a chaste and gentle male physician, or find a skilled midwife experienced in women's matters, or a woman who has some knowledge of this craft.
Then have her present and instruct her to do everything you tell her to do, first examining for the stone.  This is done by seeing if the woman is a virgin; if so, insert a finger into her rectum and search for the stone. If you find it and press it with your finger,
then instruct her to incise it. If she is not a virgin but a woman who has had intercourse, instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing it firmly.
If she finds it, she should move it from the opening of the bladder downwards as far as she can reach, until it reaches the groin. Then she should incise it opposite the middle of the vulva at the groin, whichever side allows it and where the stone is felt in that area.
And her finger should not leave the stone, pressing on it. Let the incision be small at first, then insert a probe into that small incision. If she feels the stone, enlarge the incision as much as is necessary for the stone to come out. And know that the types of stones are many.
Some are small and some are large, smooth and rough, long and round, and some have branches.  Know their types so that you may know what to do. If the bleeding is excessive, sprinkle powdered verdigris on the area and hold it there for a while until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
until the stone comes out. And be sure to have with you the instruments which were mentioned for removing stones from men, to help you in your work. If the bleeding is excessive, and you know from the pulse of the blood that it is from a severed artery, place a styptic on the area.
And bind it tightly with bandages, and leave it; do not touch it again, and leave the stone; do not remove it, for the patient might die. Then treat the wound. When the severity of the bleeding subsides after a few days, and the area becomes infected, then return to your work until the stone comes out.
Chapter sixty-two.
On the incision for the watery dropsy.
Watery dropsy is the collection of moisture in the white peritoneum which is under the skin of the scrotum surrounding the testicle, and is called the scrotum. It may be in a special membrane prepared for it by nature in a part of the testicle.
So that one thinks it is another testicle. It is between the skin of the scrotum and the white peritoneum that we mentioned. This occurs rarely. This dropsy is produced by a weakness affecting the testicles, so that this matter gathers there. It may also result from a blow to the testicles.
This moisture is of many colours; it may be yellowish, or bloody red, or black and purulent, or white and watery, which is most common. The signs by which it is known are:
Where the water collects, if it is in the white peritoneum that we mentioned, the swelling is round, slightly elongated like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
If the moisture is in a special membrane, then the swelling is round on one side of the testicle.
Therefore, one imagines it to be another testicle. If the moisture is between the skin of the scrotum and the white peritoneum, it is palpable. But if you wish to know the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe, the picture of which has preceded. Whatever comes out after the probe, you judge it according to what is inside.
If we proceed to treatment with cautery, you should order the patient to be bled if he can and you see his body is full. Then he should lie on his back on something slightly elevated, and you place many cloths under him, then you sit on his left side.
And you order a servant to sit on his right side, stretching his penis to one side of the scrotum and towards the groin. Then you take a broad scalpel and incise the skin of the scrotum lengthwise in the middle to near the pubis.
Make the incision straight, parallel to the line that divides the scrotum in half, until it reaches the white peritoneum containing it. Then peel it back and be careful not to tear it.  Your peeling should be done from the side attached to the testicle more, and you should complete the peeling as much as you can.
Then widely evacuate the water-filled peritoneum and remove all the water. Then separate the edges of the incision with hooks and stretch the peritoneum upwards, without touching the containing scrotum skin, and cut the peritoneum however you can cut it, either in its entirety or piece by piece.
Especially its thin side, for if you do not completely cut it, you cannot be sure the water will not return. If the testicle protrudes outside its skin during your work, then, once you have finished cutting the peritoneum, return it, then close the edges of the scrotum skin with sutures.
Then treat it like other wounds until it heals. If the testicle is damaged by another disease, then it is necessary to tie off the vessels in the spermatic cord for fear of bleeding, then cut the testicle from the spermatic cord and remove the testicle, then treat it as we have mentioned.
If the fluid is collected in both sides, know that there are two hydroceles. Incise the other side as you did the first, or if it is easier to do both at once, do so. Then wipe away the blood.
And insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rose ointment, and outside place other wool soaked in a medicament and oil, and spread it over the testicles and the flanks of the abdomen, and place folded cloths on top, which are the pads. And bind them from above with a bandage that has six ends, in this manner:
Then two cloths are taken, sewn together, and stuffed with fluffy wool in this way, and the ends that are used to bind it are made of cotton or damp wool, and gathered tightly in the waistband of the trousers, and one end is taken over the buttocks to the back.
The second is taken towards the pubis, and the two ends are placed on the thighs from below, and the two remaining ends on the groins, and all the binding is gathered in the waistband of the trousers. This dressing may also be made with cautery instead of incision with an iron.
It is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery and with it incise the skin of the scrotum while it is hot, as we described, until the white peritoneum containing the water is exposed. Then take another cautery of this form:
It resembles the Greek eye, then you cauterize that peritoneum with it while it is hot until all the moisture comes out, then you stretch the peritoneum with hooks and peel off with the cautery the containing layer and cut it as much as you can until you excise it all, and be careful that the testicle is not touched by the fire.
Know that this procedure is safer and prevents more blood loss, and is better than the procedure with incision.  If during the incision or during cauterization you encounter a hot swelling, bleeding, or something else, you should treat whatever you encounter with the appropriate treatment, as previously explained.
If the patient is cowardly and cannot endure this procedure because of its unpleasantness, then use cauterization as I describe, if it is proven to you by what we have presented as evidence.
If the hydrocele is watery, then the patient should sit on a high chair, then cauterize the swelling at its base with a wide scalpel, and make the cauterization along the length of the body, and make the opening wide so that all the water flows out. Then place cotton on the area and bind it.
And leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not come out during cauterization, but rather because the white membrane obstructs the opening of the wound and prevents the water from coming out,
then you should insert a goose feather or the instrument with which the water of hydroceles is extracted, the image of which has been previously shown, or enlarge the opening of the wound slightly.
And know that the water may return and accumulate after six months or so. If it accumulates, cauterize it in the same manner, and the patient should protect himself during those days.
Chapter Sixty-Three.
Concerning the incision on the fleshy scrotum and its treatment.
Know that an incision on this scrotum is one of the dangerous things leading to death in most cases; therefore, we see that it should be left alone and kept safe.  I will, however, mention the treatment and types of swelling.
I say that many swellings may occur in the bodies which constitute the testes, and this is due to many causes, either from a sharp humour which descends to the testes, or from a blow. The colour of the swelling is the same as the colour of the body, and it does not contain water.
And the swelling is hard, and perhaps the swelling is hardened, its colour is dark, and it is insensitive. It may be from the entanglement and swelling of the arteries, as has been mentioned before, or from the swelling of the veins. As for what is from the swelling of the arteries, this is known by the dispersion of the swelling.
If you press it with your fingers, it should not be exposed at all. As for that which is from the swelling of the veins, nothing disperses from it when pressed with the fingers.  This type may possibly be incised, as well as other flesh.
And that is to incise the skin of the testicle, then to extend the testicle upwards and to bring it out from the white peritoneum, and to free the spermatic cord from the vessels, and to ligate the vessels and to cut the spermatic cord after freeing it from every side of the testicle. If the testicle has adhered to those growing tissues.
Then it is necessary to bring out the testicle and cut it. And if the adhesion is between some of the peritonea or between the vessels, then it is necessary to free all that adhesion and cut it with a circular cut.
If the growth of flesh is in the place of adhesion which is from behind, then it is necessary to cut it all and bring out the testicle as we said. When your work is finished, dress the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and syrup, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
Chapter sixty-four.
In the treatment of hydrocele with a hernia.
A hernia is a twisted tumor, somewhat twisted, similar to a bunch of grapes, with relaxation of the testicles and difficulty for the patient in movement, exercise, and walking.  The treatment of this ailment is very similar to what has been mentioned previously.
However, it is necessary to mention the procedure as the ancients did. I say that it is necessary to seat the patient on a high chair, then push the scrotum downwards, then grasp the skin of the testicle with your fingers along with the vessels which are near the penis.
And let a servant hold it for you and stretch it tightly. Then incise with a wide, sharp scalpel an oblique incision along the vessels until the vessels are exposed. Then dissect from each side as I mentioned to you in the dissection of the arteries in the armpits. Then insert a needle with a doubled thread.
And tie it at the first place where the hernia appeared and tie it also at the end. Then incise it in the middle with a vertical incision along the body and remove what has gathered within of foul, putrid fluids.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds that you want to heal, so that the vessels which nourish one of the testicles fall away; there is no harm in that.  But if the hernia affects all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove one of the testicles with the vessels, lest the testicle be deprived of nourishment. before cutting the vessels, so that they wither and are of no use.
Chapter sixty-five.
In the treatment of intestinal hernia.
This hernia occurs from a tear which appears in the peritoneum extending over the abdomen towards the groins from the flanks of the abdomen, so that the intestine descends from that rupture into one of the testicles.
And this rupture is either from a tear in the peritoneum or from its extension.  These two types occur from many causes, either a blow, a jump, a shout, lifting something heavy, and the like.  Its sign, if it is from an extension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs little by little over a long time.
It does not occur suddenly, and the swelling is even towards the depth because the peritoneum compresses the intestine.  Its sign, if it is from a tear in the peritoneum, is that from its beginning it causes a great pain suddenly, and the swelling is different, apparent under the skin nearby.
That is by the exit of the intestine and its passage outside of the peritoneum.  And with the intestine, the epiploon may exit; this hernia is called intestinal and epiploic.  It may be with wind.  And the stool may flow into the intestine and be retained there, so that the death of the patient results.
Because it causes severe pain and gurgling, especially if it is constricted.  The treatment of the types of this illness with iron is dangerous, so it should be avoided. The method of treatment is that you order the patient to return the intestine with his hand into his abdomen if it is possible to return it.
Then he lies on his back between your hands and raises his legs. Then you stretch the skin next to the groin upward and incise the skin of the entire scrotum lengthwise. Then you insert hooks into the edges of the incision to the extent needed to open the incision with them.
And the incision should be of a size that allows the testicle to come out. Then you strip away the membranes which are under the skin of the scrotum until the white, hard peritoneum is revealed on every side. Then you introduce your index finger next to the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum which is under the skin of the testicle and the second peritoneum, and you loosen the adhesion which is behind the testicle. Then you draw it inwards with the right hand into the skin of the scrotum, and with this you stretch the white peritoneum upwards with the left hand and raise the testicle with the peritoneum towards the incision.
And you order the assistant to pull the testicle upwards, and you yourself completely loosen the adhesion from behind, and you search with your finger lest there be something of the twisted intestine in the white, hard peritoneum. If you find anything, then push it down into the abdomen.
Then you take a needle with thick thread twisted from ten threads and insert it at the end of the peritoneum which is under the skin of the scrotum next to the incision. Then you cut the ends of the twisted thread until there are four threads. Then you place some of them on top of each other in a firm way and tie them tightly to the peritoneum, which we said is under the skin of the scrotum, in two places. Then you also twist the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that nothing of the vessels which nourish it can reach it. Lest a hot swelling result from that, and also make a second ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it less than two fingers. After these two ligatures, you leave of the peritoneum which is under the skin of the scrotum the amount of a finger bone.
Lest a hot swelling result from that, and also make a second ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it less than two fingers. After these two ligatures, you leave of the peritoneum which is under the skin of the scrotum the amount of a finger bone. And you cut all the rest in a circle and remove the testicle with it. Then you make an incision at the bottom of the scrotum's skin so that blood and pus flow from it as we described before. Then oiled wool is used and placed in the wound, and the ligature which we described is used.
And the white peritoneum which we mentioned may be cauterized after it is cut, as a precaution against bleeding, for that often happens.  And the ligature is left until it falls off by itself. If it is slow to fall off, then let it be loosened with warm water and apply something to it that will make it sweat until it falls off.
Then you treat the wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds until it heals.
Chapter sixty-six.
Concerning the windy hernia.  I have not seen anyone dare to treat this windy hernia with iron. The ancients mentioned that it should be done as we described in the hernia with a dālīyah, that is, that the vessels be gently ligated below after an incision is made on them.
Then it is incised in the middle and the tumor is treated with something that opens it until the vessels fall away, and the wound is treated as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter sixty-seven.
Concerning the hernia which is in the groin.
A hernia may appear in the groin, as we said, so the place swells and nothing of the intestine descends into the scrotum; and if it descends, it is slight and returns at all times.
But if time passes, the fissure in the peritoneum increases until the intestine and epiploon descend into the scrotum, and this occurs from the extension of the peritoneum which is in the groin, as we said. That is because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes and the place swells and protrudes, and its treatment is by cauterization, as I have previously described.
And it may be treated with an iron instrument in this manner: the patient lies on his back in your hands, then you incise the swollen, protruding hernia horizontally to the extent of three fingers, then you loosen the peritoneum which is under the skin.
Until, when the white peritoneum which follows is uncovered, you take a probe and place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum and press it into the depth of the abdomen, then you sew the two protruding parts of the peritoneum to the end of the probe, and adhere one to the other with the suture.
Then you remove the probe, and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle nor anything else, as I instructed you in the treatment of intestinal hernia, then you treat it with the treatment of wounds.
If the threads are cut, I clean them and dress the wound until it heals, for the peritoneum contracts and the protrusion of the hernia does not increase.
Cauterization is better in this place because it is closer to safety.
Chapter sixty-eight.
On the relaxation of the skin of the testicle.
The skin of the testicle often relaxes in some people without the flesh inside relaxing, and its appearance is unsightly.  Whoever wishes to treat it should place the patient on his back.
And he cuts all the relaxed skin on the thick skin, then brings the edges together. And if you wish, first sew the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches, and make sure of the stitching, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.
Chapter sixty-nine.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our law.
Therefore, I should not have mentioned it in this book. However, I mentioned it for two reasons: one, so that it may be in the knowledge of the physician if he is asked about it, and so that he may know the treatment of one who is afflicted with it; and the other, that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
Such as lambs, goats, cats, and the like of animals.  So I say that castration is of two types: either by crushing or by incision and cutting. As for that which is done by crushing, its method is that we seat the animal in hot water until its testicles relax, soften, and hang down.
Then crush them with your hand until they dissolve and are not perceptible to the touch. As for castration by incision and cutting, it is necessary to hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with the left hand, then tie the cords and make one incision on each testicle.
Until the testicles emerge, then cut them after you have skinned them, and do not leave any of the membranes on them except the thin membrane that is on the vessels.  This type of castration is better than that which is done by crushing.
Because crushing may leave something of the testicles, so the animal desires mating. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
In the treatment of the hermaphrodite.
The hermaphrodite in men is of two types. One is that which appears in the area behind the scrotum or in the skin of the scrotum between the testicles, in a shape like a woman's vulva, with hair; and urine may flow from that which is in the scrotum's skin.
As for women, there is one type, and it is above the vulva on the pubis like small male genitalia, protruding outward, one of them like a man's penis, and the two like testicles. And the treatment of the three types.
The two types in men and the one type in women: it is necessary to cut away that excess flesh until its trace is removed, then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals. As for the second type in men, from which urine flows, which is in the scrotum's skin, there is no action in it, nor is there any benefit from its removal.
Chapter seventy-one.
On the excision of the clitoris and the protruding flesh from the vulvas of women.
The clitoris may exceed the natural amount, until it becomes large and unsightly, and it may enlarge in some women until it becomes prominent like in men and becomes fit for intercourse.
Then you should grasp the excess of the clitoris with your hand or with forceps and cut it off, and do not go too far in cutting, especially in the depth of the root, lest bleeding occurs.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds until it heals. As for the growing flesh, it is flesh that grows in the mouth of the womb until it fills it.
And it may come out to the outside like a tail. Therefore, some of the ancients call it the "tail disease."  Then you should cut it off as you cut off the clitoris, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Two.
In the treatment of prolapse.
Prolapse is when a woman's vulva is not perforated, or the perforation is small. This may be congenital or acquired.  The acquired kind results from a previously existing condition, and this may be from an excess of growing flesh.
Or a thin or thick membrane, and it may be in the depth of the uterus, or in its sides, or at its top or bottom. It prevents intercourse, conception, and childbirth, and may also prevent menstruation. This is recognized by examination by the midwife.
If the obstruction is apparent and near, but if it is not apparent, then she should examine it with her fingers or with a probe. If the obstruction is from a thin membrane and is near the labia, then hasten to rupture it.  This is done by placing something like pledgets on the labia, then placing both thumbs together.
The woman lies on her back with her legs spread apart. Then, she forcefully stretches the labia until the thin membrane is ruptured and the obstruction is opened. Then, she takes wool, soaks it in oil, and applies it to the area. The woman should have intercourse daily, lest the area close again.
If the membrane is thick and dense, then it should be incised with a broad scalpel resembling an aspen leaf. If the obstruction is from excess flesh, then suspend it with hooks and cut it. You should have styptics at hand that do not sting, such as acacia, mastic, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then, use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not close quickly. Keep it in place for several days and use a wick of dry linen, then treat it with other methods of healing until it is healed.  Other fleshy growths may occur in the uterus; these should be cut in this manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor. A cancerous tumor in the uterus should never be treated with iron.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red sores that appear in the vulva of women.
As for hemorrhoids, they are a swelling of the mouths of the veins, so that much blood constantly flows from them.  If hemorrhoids persist, they become warts.  Their types and signs have been mentioned in the classification, and we will mention them here.
What accepts treatment and what does not accept treatment. I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are deep within the uterus and do not appear to the touch, have no treatment with iron. Those that are at the mouth of the uterus and can be felt are the ones that are treated.
Then the woman should enter a cool room, and then the warts should be stretched with a hook or a rough cloth and cut from their roots. Then, if bleeding occurs, apply one of the styptics that stops bleeding without cauterizing.
Such as acacia, catechu, frankincense, and the like. Then she should raise her legs to the wall for an hour, then lower them into cold water. If the bleeding continues, seat her in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, gallnuts, and the like. Then take barley flour, and knead it with honey and vinegar.
And apply it as a compress to her back. If the bleeding stops, otherwise, apply cupping to the loins and breasts without restriction. Then take wool, dip it in the juice of the mandrake, or the juice of Plantago, or the juice of the branches of the Verbascum, with a gallnut drink, and apply it to the area.
If the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals. As for the red pustule, it resembles the heads of the intestines, rough in appearance.  It should be cut as described for warts, and treated until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
Concerning the suppuration which occurs in the uterus.
Many types of tumors may occur in the uterus, such as cancer, hard tumors, ulcers, fistulas, phagedena,  abscesses, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and hot tumors.  I have described all these diseases, their types, and their symptoms in the classification.
It is necessary in this chapter to mention the hot tumor which occurs in the uterus, if it is among the tumors which collect over time, how its suppuration is done with iron.  It should be examined; if the pain of the tumor is initially sharp, with throbbing, inflammation, and fever,
and you see it red when touched, do not hasten to its suppuration, and treat it with what helps in ripening, until these symptoms subside. Then, the woman should sit on a chair with two seats and lean on its back.
and bring her legs together towards the lower abdomen, and her thighs should be apart, and her arms should be under her knees, and bind them with a suitable bandage.
Then the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument with which the mouth of the uterus is opened, the image of which comes later. If you want to use this instrument, you should measure with a probe the depth of the woman's uterus, lest what enters from the instrument be more than the depth of the uterus.
Then it harms the patient. If the instrument is longer than the depth, it is necessary to place pledgets on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus.  The screw which runs in the instrument should be on the upper side.
And you hold the instrument, and the attendant turns the screw until the cervix is opened. When the abscess appears and is touched by the hand and is soft and thin, it should be incised at its head with a wide scalpel. When all the pus is evacuated,
a soft pledget soaked in rose oil or green oil containing some astringent should be placed in the wound. The pledget should be outside the incision in the cervix, and clean wool soaked in water in which alchemilla has been boiled should be placed externally on the uterus and pubis.
Then, after two days, treat with the ointment which is suitable for that until it heals.
And the uterus and wound may be washed by injecting with water and honey, then with water in which licorice root or long rhubarb has been boiled. Then return to the ointment, if the abscess is hidden inside the uterus.
Then you should refrain from treating it with iron, but treat it with what we mentioned in the section.
Chapter seventy-five.
On instructing midwives how to treat living fetuses if they emerge in an unnatural manner.
The midwife should first know the form of a natural birth.  Among its signs, if you see the woman straining downwards and yearning to breathe air and what she is experiencing from childbirth becomes easier for her.
And the fetus's emergence is quickened. Know that this birth is in the natural manner, and its emergence is head first with the afterbirth with it or hanging from its navel. If you see these signs, then you should press her abdomen so that the fetus emerges quickly.
For if it descends head first, the afterbirth descends with it and is cleansed of those impurities well. Whatever is besides this birth is unnatural and blameworthy, for the fetus may emerge on its feet, and its hands may emerge before its head and feet.
And one hand or one foot, or its head and hand may emerge, or it may emerge folded, and perhaps it turns onto its back and similar blameworthy forms.  It is necessary for the midwife to be skillful and gentle with all these things and to beware of mistakes and errors.
And I am explaining each form and how the means in it is so that you may be guided by that and stand upon it. If the fetus emerges head first—the natural emergence—and that is severe for the woman and labor is difficult for her, and you see that her strength has weakened, then seat her on a chair and order women to restrain her.
And pack her womb with cooked fenugreek and with moist ointments, then the midwife inserts a small scalpel between her fingers and cuts the afterbirth with it, or cuts it with her fingernail until the moisture within flows out, and she presses the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then it is necessary to inject the woman with fenugreek saliva with shirāj ointment, then after the injection, order her to cough and make her sneeze with a sternutatory and hold her mouth and nose, for the fetus will emerge immediately. If the hands of the fetus emerge first, then it is necessary to return them gently little by little.
If they do not readily allow entry, place the woman on a stool and raise her legs upwards, then shake the stool on the ground, and the woman holds on so that she does not fall when shaken. If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them moderately, then he will emerge.  The emergence of the fetus on its feet: If the fetus emerges on its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards, then turn the fetus little by little until you straighten it, then take one of its feet and extend it little by little.
If they emerge to the thighs, order her to cough and make her sneeze with a sternutatory, then it will emerge. If it does not emerge as we described, otherwise return the fetus little by little until you put it into its natural form, then it will emerge smoothly. If it is prevented by all that we have described.
Take some saliva of the plant *khatmi*, and saliva of fenugreek, and shirāj ointment, and dissolved gum, and pound everything together in a mortar well, then apply it to the vulva of the woman and the lower part of her abdomen, then seat her in lukewarm water until it reaches the pubic bone.
If you see that her lower parts have softened, make a pessary for her of myrrh and she will tolerate it.  If the pessary remains in place for an hour, then seat her on a stool, then make her sneeze, and close her mouth and nose, and gently squeeze her lower abdomen, then the fetus will emerge immediately.  The emergence of the fetus on its knees and hands.
If it emerges in this manner, gently insert its hands little by little, then the woman lies on her back and hangs her hips downwards while lying on a bed and clasps her hands, then press gently on her abdomen little by little. Then remove the pillows from under her legs so that her lower parts are raised. If the fetus does not emerge, take both her legs and move them vigorously, then press gently above the pubic bone little by little until the fetus ascends upwards, then the midwife inserts her hand and adjusts the fetus little by little.
And instruct the woman to strain until the fetus emerges. The emergence of the fetus sideways, hanging by one of its hands; gently try to replace its hand. If you are unable to replace it, make the woman stand and have her walk. If she is unable to walk, let her lie down.
on her bed and shake her legs vigorously. Then use the poultice which I described from the saliva. If labor pains seize her, seat her on a stool, then work to replace the hand and adjust the fetus to its natural position, and make the woman sneeze and instruct her to strain until it emerges.
The emergence of the fetus on its back, extending its hands, and its face towards its mother's back. The midwife should grasp the hand of the fetus, then turn it little by little and gently adjust it. Once it is adjusted, apply to its head what we described of the ointment and poultices.
Then tell her to move little by little. If she does this, seat her on the stool and tell her to lean to the right side, then tell her to strain and make her sneeze with a sternutatory, then it will emerge.  The emergence of the fetus upright on its side.
If it descends to the mouth of the womb in this manner with the placenta, tear the placenta with your fingernail until it is emptied of moisture. If it adheres to the face and neck of the fetus, cut it from the navel lest it be strangled and die, then push the fetus inwards until it is in the proper position.
And tell the woman to strain repeatedly, then it will emerge easily. The emergence of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are frequently born, and three or four may be born and live, although this is rare. As for five, it is something outside of nature; they will not live at all.
And they are surrounded, even if numerous, by a single placenta, and they are separated by a membrane, a barrier between them, attached to the navel of each one. And they may emerge like a single fetus, naturally and easily, and they may emerge in a blameworthy manner as we described.
If one of them is difficult at birth and becomes as we said, in unnatural forms, then treat it as we described. And let the midwife be gentle and do what she does with gentleness and slowness, and she should contrive for every form with whatever means is available to her leading to safety.
Mention of what is conceived in the womb of fetuses that are aborted. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten may be conceived in the womb.  It has been confirmed to me that a woman aborted seven, and another fifteen, all conceived.
By the estimation of the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing. All of this should be in the knowledge of the midwife, for perhaps such a thing will happen to her someday, so she will meet it with what is appropriate.
Chapter seventy-six.
In the extraction of the dead fetus.
If you treat the dead fetus with what I mentioned in the section on treatment, and it does not come out, and you are compelled to work with your hand, then you should look. If the woman is healthy and strong, and has nothing of the symptoms from which harm is feared, then the woman should lie on her back on a bed.
And her head should be tilted downwards and her legs raised, and a servant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed, lest her body be pulled when the fetus is drawn out.
Then moisten her womb with moist ointments, along with the saliva of the dog and fenugreek and flaxseed. Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these ointments and saliva, then gently insert it into the womb, then search with it for a place to hook the fetus, and the appropriate places for that.
Look; if the fetus is positioned to descend headfirst, then hook into its eyes, or its nape, or its mouth, or its palate, or under its chin or collarbone, or in the areas near the ribs, or under the cartilages.
But if its descent is feet first, then [hook into] the pubis and the middle ribs.  It is necessary to hold the hook with the right hand, and to bend it between the fingers of the left hand, and to gently insert the hand and hook into some of those places that we have mentioned.
Until you reach something firm, then insert another hook opposite it, or a third if needed, so that the traction is even and does not tilt to one side. Then pull with a steady pull; and the pull should not be straight only, but should be moved in every direction.
So that its exit is made easier, as is done with a tooth when it is extracted.  Between these actions, the pull should be relaxed. If it becomes stuck on one side, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with ointment and insert them from that side to rotate what is stuck. If some of the fetus emerges, then move the hooks to other places.
[The midwife] raises it slightly, doing this until the entire fetus emerges. If a hand emerges before anything else and cannot be returned because of its compression, then it is necessary to wrap a cloth around it and then pull it until, when it has entirely emerged, it is cut.
Either at the wrist joint or at the elbow.  Thus it is necessary to act in the other hand and in the legs. If the head of the fetus is large and experiences difficulty in exiting, or if there is collected water in its head, then it is necessary to insert a hooked scalpel between the fingers.
And split the head with it so that the water exits, or extract it with the instrument called the *mishdakh*, whose image comes with the images of the other instruments in the chapter which follows this one.
Similarly, if the fetus is naturally large-headed, it is necessary to split the skull or crush it with the *mishdakh*, as we have said, then remove the bones with the hooks. If the head emerges and is compressed at the clavicle, then let it be split so that the moisture in the chest flows out.
For the chest then becomes constricted.  If the chest does not become constricted and egress is not achieved, then cut as much as you can. If the lower abdomen is swollen or has a swelling, then it is necessary to puncture it so that the moisture flows from it.
If the fetus is in a feet-first position, then pulling it is easy and straightening it towards the mouth of the uterus is simple. If it is compressed at the abdomen or chest, then it is necessary to pull it with a cloth wrapped around your hand and split the abdomen or chest until what is in them flows out.
If all the limbs are extracted and the head is retracted and retained, let the midwife insert her left hand. If the mouth of the uterus is open, let her insert her hand into the neck of the uterus and seek the head with it and pull it with her fingers to the mouth of the uterus, then insert a hook or two hooks into it and pull it with them.
If the mouth of the uterus has become constricted due to a hot swelling affecting it, then it is not necessary to be forceful on it, but it is necessary then to use the pouring of moist, fatty substances and to use poultices and sit in waters which relax and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, if it is possible to straighten it, then let what we mentioned for the live fetus be used. If that is not possible, then let it be cut and removed.  It is necessary not to leave any of the afterbirth inside at all.  When you have finished your treatment, use what we have mentioned for the treatment of the hot swellings which appear in the uteruses.
If bleeding occurs, then let her descend into astringent waters and use all other treatments. I have witnessed a woman who had conceived, and the fetus died in her womb, and then she conceived again upon it.
Then the other fetus also died. After a long time, a swelling appeared in her womb and it swelled until it opened and began to discharge pus. I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not close, so I put on it some strong, drawing ointments.
Then a bone came out of the place. Then days passed and another bone came out. I was amazed by that, since the abdomen is a place where there are no bones. I judged that they were from the bones of the dead fetus, so I examined the wound and removed from it many bones from the bones of the fetus's head.
I continued doing this until I removed many bones from her, and the woman was in the best of health.  She lived like that for a time, a little pus being discharged from the place. And I have only mentioned this rare case here.
because in it there is knowledge and aid for what the skillful physician attempts with his hand in treatment.
Chapter seventy-seven.
In it are images of the instruments which are needed in removing the fetus.
Image of a screw to open the mouth of the womb.
This is the binder with which books are bound; it has two screws at the ends of the two pieces of wood, except that this screw should be finer than the binder and should be either of ebony or of boxwood, and the width of each piece of wood should be the thickness of two fingers.
And their width is about a finger and their length is a span and a half, and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two guides of the same material as the wood itself, which are fastened in them; their length is half a span or a little more, and their width is about two fingers or a little more, and these two guides…
are those which enter the mouth of the womb to open it when you turn the screws; an image of another instrument for the same purpose, finer and lighter.
It is made of ebony or boxwood in the shape of hooks, except that it has two guides at its end, as you see; the length of each guide is about a span, and their width is two fingers; so if you want to open the womb with it…
then seat the woman on a bed with her legs hanging down, spread apart between her thighs; then insert these two guides together into the mouth of the womb, while you hold the end of the instrument below between her thighs; then open your hand with the instrument as you do with the hooks, to whatever extent you want to open the womb. until the midwife does what she wants. An image of another screw mentioned by the ancients.
Image of the instrument which pushes the fetus.
Image of the forceps with which the head of the fetus is extracted.
It resembles scissors, it has teeth at the end as you see, and it may be made rectangular like hooks, in this image as you see, it has teeth like the teeth of a saw, you cut and tear with it.
Image of a pusher also.
Image of a hook.
This hook should be somewhat thick so that it does not break when pulling the fetus with it. Image of a hook with two barbs.
Image of two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus.
All these instruments, the more numerous their types and the better prepared they are by the craftsman, the quicker his work and the higher his standing among people. Therefore, do not disdain any instrument that you have prepared, for there will surely be a need for it.
Chapter seventy-eight.
In removing the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, then you should instruct the patient to hold herself, then make her sneeze with a sternutatory and press your hand on her mouth and nostrils. If it comes out this way, well and good; otherwise, use a forceps.
And pierce a hole in the lid and place in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as vervain, rue, dill, chamomile, wormwood, fumitory, and centaury; all or some of these medications.  Submerge them in water and place them over a fire. Then place a silver tube on the hole in the lid of the pot and the other end in the mouth of the womb.
And hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the womb, then make her sneeze as we said. Then the placenta will come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to immerse her left hand in goose grease or mallow juice.
Then she should insert it into the vagina and search for the placenta. If she finds it, she should grasp it and pull it out little by little. If it is attached deep in the womb, then insert the hand as we described, until you find the placenta, then pull it out little by little, gently.
Lest the womb fall out with a strong pull, but it should be moved gently to the sides, right and left, then the amount of pulling should be increased. Then it will respond and be freed from its attachment. If the mouth of the womb is constricted, then we have described the treatment with sneezing and the treatment with the pot and herbs.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, then avoid violence in pulling again.  But it should be bound from where it has come out to the mouth of the womb to the woman's thigh, then inject it with the tetrapharmacon, for it will cause it to rot after a few days.
And it will dissolve and come out. However, if it becomes putrid, a bad smell will rise from it to the stomach and head, and this will harm the patient. Therefore, suitable fumigation should be used.
Therefore, some of the ancients have tried the fumigation of rue and dried figs.  The image of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated when menstruation and the placenta are retained, and so on:
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or it is made of copper. The thin end is placed in the vagina, and the wide end is placed on the fire, and the incense is placed on the coals. It is held until that incense is gone, and then more is added.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
On the treatment of the non-perforated fistula.
Many boys are born with their anus imperforate; a thin membrane may have closed it.  It is necessary for the midwife to perforate that membrane with her finger; otherwise, let her incise it with a sharp scalpel, being careful not to touch the muscle.
Then she should place wool soaked in syrup and oil on it, and then treat it with ointments until it heals. If she fears that it will close up, let her place a lead tube in the opening for many days and remove it whenever the child wants to defecate.
The anus may also become obstructed by the healing of a wound or a tumor.  This adhesion should be incised, and then treated as described above with medication and the lead tube.
Chapter Eighty.
On the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower region.
Fistulas which occur in the lower region are a complication and thickening which occurs near the anus externally or internally from one side.  The fistula may be single or multiple.
If this complication becomes chronic, it opens and a watery white fluid or thin pus discharges from it. Some of these fistulas may penetrate to the bladder and the intestine, and some may not.  Those which penetrate may be recognized by the discharge of feces and flatus from them when the patient defecates.
Worms may also emerge from them.  There may be fistulas, if they are internal, which penetrate to the bladder and to the urethra. Some may penetrate to the hip joint and to the sacrum. A fistula penetrating to the rectum can also be distinguished from one which does not.
You should insert your index finger into the rectum and insert a thin probe into the fistula, made of copper or iron, if the fistula is not tortuous. If it is tortuous, then insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair into it.
Until you feel the probe or hair with your finger. If you do not feel it at all and nothing emerges from the opening, neither feces, nor flatus, nor worms, as we have said, then know that it is not penetrating; proceed to treatment.
If the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urethra, the sign is the passage of urine from it and the inability of the area to heal with medication.  If it penetrates to the hip joint or to the sacrum, the sign is the probe reaching there.
If there is no tortuosity to the bone, and pain is present in that area, and pus constantly emerges from it, and treatment is ineffective, and it does not heal with ointment—all these penetrating fistulas—then there is absolutely no cure for them.
And their treatment is a futile effort for those ignorant physicians who attempt it. As for those that are not penetrating and not chronic, recovery is hoped for with cautery, as I describe and as I have tested.  This is to place the patient on his back between your hands.
Raise his legs and tilt his thighs toward his abdomen. Then insert a copper or lead probe, if there is a tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it toward the rectum, then you should insert your index finger into the rectum.
If you feel the probe in your finger, having penetrated openly without feeling any membrane or flesh between your finger and it, then know for certain that it is penetrating, so do not tire yourself with it, for there is no cure for it, as we said.
And they have said that it heals in some people rarely.  And of the treatments for which benefit is hoped for is to heat a thin cautery iron according to the size of the fistula, as has been previously mentioned, and insert it hot into the fistula until it reaches toward the rectum, then repeat it two or three times.
Until you know that all that excess, matted flesh resembling a bird's feather tube has been burned. Then treat it with lint soaked in butter until the burned flesh comes out, then treat it with healing ointments, if it heals.
Otherwise, it will never heal with any other treatment. But if you insert the probe and it does not penetrate to your finger which is in the rectum, and there was a thick barrier of flesh or membrane between it and the probe, and you see the fistula near the surface of the skin, then incise the skin from the beginning of the fistula. And as you pass with the incision along with the probe, while it is in the fistula, until you reach with the incision where the tip of the probe ends, and the probe becomes free and falls out. Then cleanse that matted flesh resembling a bird feather tube, and leave nothing of it.
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If blood overcomes you and prevents you from cutting that flesh, then the best and quickest remedy is cauterization with fire or a caustic medicine, because cauterization with fire combines two good things: burning that excess flesh.
And cutting the blood and drying the moisture. Then treat it with lint soaked in butter or sulfur powdered with oil, until the area suppurates and that burned flesh comes out in the pus. Then treat the wound with healing ointments that grow firm flesh.
These are medicines that constrict and dry, for when it is closed, it has healed and you do not fear a return. If the fistula has reached the depth of the rectum and is far from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the rectum and explore with it.
If you feel the probe and between you and it a membrane of peritoneum or flesh, and it is near to penetration, then the work in it is only by way of hope and expectation, that is, you use one of three methods: either cauterize it as we said.
Or incise it until you reach its bottom so that you can insert the lint and treat it from up close. Do not extend the incision lest you cut the muscle surrounding the rectum and cause the patient to involuntarily pass stool. Then treat it as we mentioned; perhaps it will heal as we said.
Or penetrate that membrane and pierce it after incising it near the rectum as we said, either with a probe or with another sharp-pointed instrument. Then clean all the thickened flesh in the incision as far as you can, thoroughly.
Then suture the entire wound, including the incision and the upper opening, until it is closed and the fistula remains open inside the rectum, which is easier for the patient. And the fistula may be perforated in this manner.
And if you insert the probe into the fistula and it is in a side of the rectum toward the surface of the body with the skin and the circumference of the rectum, then take a probe with a perforated tip like a shoemaker's needle, in this image:.
And insert a twisted thread of five or so threads into it, then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its bottom.  If it penetrates the margin of the rectum from the inside nearby.
Then bring the thread out through that hole by inserting your finger into the rectum and bringing out the end of the thread, and bring both ends together and tighten them and leave it for a day or two.  Whenever the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the ends of the threads is severed and falls away. Then treat the wound until it heals and is cured.
If the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, penetrate it however you can, except that it should not be very deep, for you should not do that because of the muscle, lest you cut it. Then do with it as we have mentioned until it heals.
The image of the hooked scalpel with which fistulas are incised: its hook is very sharp, and the other side is not sharp, lest you cut what is not necessary, as you see.
Chapter Eighty-One.
Concerning the opening of hemorrhoids from which blood flows, their excision, and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds: either they are inside the rectum, resembling red bladders or like grapes, and there are small ones and large ones, and blood always flows from them.
And there may be one or many, and they may be outside the rectum and at its edges, except that those which are outside the rectum are, for the most part, less moist, with a yellowish fluid or a little blood flowing from them constantly, and they are the color of the skin.
The treatment of those which are inside the rectum is that you should order the patient to strain and bear down until the rectum protrudes and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then quickly seize them with hooks or grasp them with your nail, and then cut them at their base.  If the hooks do not hold because of their moistness and laxity,
then rub them with a rough cloth or a piece of a hard sponge, or pull them with your fingers, then cut them. Then, after cutting, sprinkle on them some sharp powders, so that they may act in place of cautery, or cauterize them as explained in the chapter on cautery.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. If the rectum does not protrude, then inject the patient with an enema containing a little irritant, to wash what is in the rectum and cause it to protrude quickly when the patient strains. As for the hemorrhoids which are outside the rectum, their treatment is easy.
That is, you should seize them with your nail or hook them with a hook and cut them, then treat them as we have mentioned until they heal. And whoever dislikes cutting with iron, it is necessary that he use a ligature in this manner: take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the hemorrhoid upwards and pass the needle through its base from the other side, and twist the ends of the thread below the needle while it is crosswise, and pull the hemorrhoid tightly, then tie the thread and remove the needle. Do this to all the hemorrhoids, and leave one which you do not ligate.
so that the remaining blood may flow from it. Then place on the rectum a cloth soaked in rose oil or cyperus oil, and place it on the rectum and order the patient to be still, then leave him until they fall. When the hemorrhoids have fallen, treat them with ointments and other treatments until they heal.
As for the treatment of fissures, they often arise from dryness of the feces and retention of the humors. If they become chronic and medicine does not work, it is necessary to scrape it with the blade of a scalpel or with your fingernail until it becomes moist and the upper layer which prevents it from uniting is removed.
Then treat it until it heals properly. If it does not heal, repeat the scraping more severely than the first time until it bleeds well and is excoriated, then treat it, for it will heal.
Chapter eighty-two.
On the treatment of ingrown and non-ingrown nails, dry warts, and corns.
A corn is a round nodule, the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail. It occurs throughout the body, especially on the soles of the feet and the toes, and causes pain when walking.
It is necessary to incise around the corn, grasp it with a hook or forceps, and remove it from its root, then treat it. If you wish, cauterize it as previously described in its chapter. As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, nodular outgrowth on the surface of the body.
They frequently appear on the hands of children.  Its treatment is to stretch the wart and cut it off, or pierce it with silk thread or a hair until it falls off. If you wish, cauterize it with fire or a caustic drug, as previously described.
Ingrown and non-ingrown warts may be removed with the instrument I have described in the treatment of corns. As for corns, they are also a small, nodular, thick outgrowth on the surface of the body, extending deeply. If they are exposed to cold, a sensation similar to the sting of ants is felt in them.
They occur throughout the body, most often on the hands.  Its treatment is to take a tube of strong goose or eagle feather, and place this tube over the corn so that the tube's circumference surrounds it on all sides.  Then rotate the tube with your hand until you incise around the corn.
This will cause it to go deep into the flesh, and the corn will be removed from its root.  If you wish, you can do this with a copper or iron tube in this manner:
The top of the tube should be solid and twisted to facilitate its grip and rotation by the fingers. If you wish, cauterize the corn as previously described in the cauterization of warts in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter eighty-three.
On the shapes of instruments used for injections in rectal ailments, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe may be made of silver, china, or cast or hammered copper.  Small and large versions of this instrument may be made according to the users. Those used to treat young children should be small, and those for patients with narrow or painful rectums should be very gentle. Image of a large syringe:
Its upper funnel, to which the bag is tied, is wide in this manner; it has a partition where the bag is tied, as you see, and its lower end, which enters the rectum, is solid, very smooth, and slender; on one side it has two holes, and on the other side one hole.
The size of the hole should be the thickness of a gimlet or slightly larger, and the bag in which the medicine is placed should be made of an animal bladder or sheepskin, shaped like a small bowl, its diameter being a span.
It is pierced with many holes, arranged in a circle, the distance between each hole being the thickness of a finger. Then a strong thread is inserted into those holes, spun from ten or so strands, and the bag is gathered with it like a bowl. Then, when the medicine is placed in it, it is tightly bound at the head of the syringe between two stones, and then it is injected. This is an image of the circular bag and the holes:
The method of injection is to fill the skin or bladder with warmed medicine, to a degree the patient can tolerate; beware of it being too hot or too cold. Then the patient lies on his back and raises his legs.
A sheet or blanket is placed beneath him, then the tip of the syringe is lubricated with oil, egg white, fenugreek saliva or something similar, and it is gently inserted into the rectum. Then the attendant takes the bag in both hands and squeezes it firmly until all the contents of the syringe are emptied into the bowel.
Then the syringe is removed, and the patient raises his legs to the wall. If the medicine stimulates evacuation, let him restrain himself as much as possible; and if he sleeps all night with it, it will be more beneficial.  If injected for diarrhea and evacuation is hurried, let the injection be repeated until he recovers.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful swellings in the rectum, let the syringe be very soft and smooth, smoother than those used to inject children. This is an image of a soft syringe with its skin stretched over it:
Chapter Eighty-Four.
In the treatment of wounds.
I have mentioned in the classification the treatment of what resembles cauterizations, and I will now describe their treatment by hand and by medicine completely.  I say that wounds differ according to the instrument with which the wound is made and according to the location where the wound occurs.
The things that cause wounds are many, such as a blow from a stone, or a cut from a sword or knife, or a stab from a spear, stick, or arrow, and so on from many things.
As for wounds according to their location on the body, there is the wound that occurs on the head, or neck, or chest, or abdomen, or liver, and so on from the organs.
And I am describing the treatment of some wounds to make them a measure and rule for all wounds, and I begin with simple head wounds, especially because the compound ones will be mentioned in the beginning of the third chapter of this book.
So I say that when a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture of the bone, I look; and if it is from a blow from a stone or the like, and only the skin is lacerated, and the wound is large, and I fear the occurrence of hot inflammation in the patient, then I hasten and incise the cephalic vein in that place. And do not delay that, and let blood be drawn from him according to his strength, if nothing prevents bloodletting, especially if the blood that comes out of the wound is little, and let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the injured part.
And warn the patient against fullness, drinks, and thick foods; if something prevents him from bloodletting, let him reduce his food, and not approach meats or drinks. And apply to the wound, if hot inflammation occurs in it, cotton soaked in rose oil alone, or with a styptic drink.
And if you are safe from hot inflammation, then apply to the wound, if it is fresh and the air has not altered it, the powder which I shall describe to you shortly; but if the air has altered it, then apply some ointments to it.
Until pus forms, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large, and is from a sword cut or the like, and its edges do not come together by themselves, then join it by suturing, as I describe in the suturing of abdominal wounds.
If the skin exposes the bone and hangs down, and its attachment is only by a small piece, cut it off, then treat the wound with medicines which produce firm flesh in place of the skin; and order the patient to nourish himself with foods which possess firmness, such as heads and broths, and the like.
If gangrene occurs in the skin and does not adhere to the bone, cut away all that is gangrenous and throw it away, then treat it.  If in these wounds there is an artery or vein which bleeds and the bleeding is not stopped by medicines, then search for the artery.
If you find it and it is not severed, sever it with the scalpel and tie it.  And if necessity demands, if what we have mentioned is not effective, cauterize it until the bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and superficial, then their treatment is easy and simple; it suffices to treat them by sprinkling this powder on them while they are still bleeding.
before the air alters them. The preparation of the powder is: take one part frankincense, two parts acacia, and three parts of slaked or unslaked lime; grind all together, sift it, and fill the wound with it, and bind it tightly so that it adheres well.
It will coagulate with the blood; then bind it from above with bandages and leave it; do not unbind it as long as it does not swell, for the medicine will not separate from it until it heals.  And the lime alone may do this if you do not have frankincense and acacia.
This action may also be done with alum in many large wounds if its application and binding are skillful, and the wounds are fresh and bleeding, provided the air has not altered them.  But if the air has altered them somewhat, especially in summer,
then the application of this powder is pointless; treat it as we have mentioned, by applying some ripening ointments or a poultice of barley flour made with water and honey until the pus is discharged, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
But if a fracture occurs in the bone along with the wound, and it is slight, pull it with a forceps. I have described the treatment of head fractures in what follows, in the surgery of the neck. If the wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between it and a head wound if it is slight.
But if a nerve or artery in the neck has been severed, if it is a nerve, there is no remedy except to avoid treating it with things that strongly constrict, like verdigris and vitriol and the like, because they harm the nerve and cause it to spasm.
And nothing cold should be placed on the wound at all, because the essence of the nerve is cold and its connection is to the brain, which is the noblest of organs. What you treat it with should be soft medicines such as washed natron, moistened with fresh water many times, moistened with oil or rose ointment and tutty.
If it is also washed with fresh water and other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments. But if the wound is large, use sutures or bind its edges with bandages, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound is deep and a cavity forms at its bottom in which pus collects, lance it at its lowest point. If an artery is severed in the wound and you see its blood flowing, ligate it or cauterize it if necessity demands it.
If the wound has severed some or all of the cartilages of the larynx and the windpipe is unharmed, join the edges of the skin by stitching over the windpipe.  Do not touch the windpipe itself, but straighten it and restore it to its natural shape, then tightly bind it and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments that have astringent and drying properties until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, explore it; if there are bone splinters, extract them all, or as many as possible.  Leave those you cannot reach until the wound suppurates, heals, and their removal becomes easier.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle on it the powder we have described. If a bone in the wound suppurates and becomes necrotic, treat it as described in its chapter, in the surgery of the chest and between the shoulders.
If it is a wound from a spear or knife and you see that it is deep, observe whether air escapes from it when the patient breathes. If so, know that it is a mortal wound. If it is not deep and is fresh with blood, do not initially apply powder to it nor bind it tightly, lest the blood be retained in its depths.
This will cause it to spread to the heart and kill the patient.  However, apply an absorbent ointment and dress it twice a day. If you do not have ointment, place an old cotton ball in the wound opening to absorb the secretions, and have the patient sleep on the wound.
so that whatever collects there may flow out. If three days or more have passed since the injury, and the patient has not experienced convulsions, a bad pulse, or shortness of breath, and you see that his other conditions are good, know that the wound is safe and treat it with cauterization and other treatments until it heals.
If it is difficult to see and the suppuration is continuous, know that it has become necrotic, and treat it according to its chapter.  If the wound is in the chest or back, treat it with the previously described stitching.
If it is large, use powders; if it is small, do not. If it has affected the bone and broken off fragments, explore the wound and promptly remove those fragments if they are loose. If they are not loose, leave them until...
the wound becomes septic; then it will be easy to remove them. As for other wounds occurring in other members, their treatment is governed by what we have mentioned.
Chapter Eighty-five.
On abdominal wounds, the protrusion of the intestines, and their suturing.
The wound which affects the abdomen may be large, or it may be small or medium.  A large wound may allow the intestine or several intestines to protrude; returning them and suturing is more difficult and arduous.
A small wound may also be difficult in another way, making the return more arduous.  If the intestine is not immediately returned to its place, it swells and thickens, making its return difficult. For this reason, a medium-sized wound is preferable, because returning the intestine is not as difficult with it as with the other two types.
Know that suturing the abdomen is done in four ways. Two sutures are general, suitable for suturing the abdomen and for suturing all other wounds of the body.  The other two sutures are specific, used for all wounds, but they are most appropriate for suturing the abdomen.
And I will describe them to you one by one with explanation and clarification. I say that if the wound is small and some of the intestine protrudes and its return is difficult, that is for one of two reasons: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we said, or because the intestine has been inflated by exposure to cold air.
If this is so, then it should be warmed by dipping a sponge or a damp cloth in lukewarm water alone, or in water in which dill, sweet basil, and spikenard have been boiled, and applying it to the intestine until the inflation subsides.
A styptic drink may also do this, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflation.  If you see that the inflation has subsided, wet the intestine with water in which comfrey or mallow has been boiled; for this will make its entry easier.
If its return is still difficult after this treatment, make a small incision in the wound with the instrument with which you incise fistulas. The first treatment, if successful, is better than incision. Incision is only resorted to after necessity and the failure of other methods. This is an image of the instrument:
One side is curved and limited, the other side is unlimited.  The thin end is not as fine as a lancet, but rather somewhat blunt.  It is an instrument resembling a small spatula, as you see. If the wound is wide and the intestine has entered, then it should be returned to its natural shape.
And its proper place, if you can manage it, is best. But if the wound is wide and is in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on his back with his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the upper abdomen, his head and chest should be higher than his lower body.
Similarly, if the wound is on one side of the abdomen, always keep the side with the injury higher than the other side.  This should be done in large and medium-sized wounds.
As for small wounds, position it as best you can. Then have a skilled assistant ready to hold the entire wound with both hands, bringing its edges together, then revealing it bit by bit to the person performing the stitching.
This is the description of a common suture: take one needle, or several needles, according to the size of the wound. Then leave a space from the edge of the wound equal to the thickness of the little finger, and insert a needle without thread into the edges of the skin. along with the edges of the peritoneum beneath the skin from the inside, until you pass it through from that side.  Having brought together the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, making four layers, then tie a doubled thread around the needle several times from both sides until the edges of the wound are firmly joined.
Then leave a space equal to the thickness of a finger again, and insert another needle, then tie it with the thread as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this with as many needles as necessary until you have completed the entire circumference of the wound. Let the needles be of a moderate thickness, neither too thick nor too thin.
Because very thin needles quickly cut the flesh, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin, therefore they should be of moderate thickness.  And the needle should not be inserted into the edge of the skin too close to the wound itself.
lest the flesh quickly tear and the wound open before it heals.  Do not space the sutures too widely apart either, lest the wound fail to unite.  Then cut off the ends of the needles lest they injure the patient in his sleep, and make for him pads of linen from each side to hold the ends of the needles.
And leave them until you know that the wound has healed. This type of suture with needles is most suitable for small wounds, because one or two needles, or so, may suffice for suturing them.
As for the method of suturing the second type, the common one, it is that you gather with the suture the four edges, namely the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the peritoneum, at once with a needle carrying a twisted thread of moderate thickness, then when you have passed the needle through these four edges, return the needle to the side from which you began.
So that the thread falls interwoven from the top of the wound, so that the suture is according to the stitching of a pouch with which goods are tied.  And make the space between each stitch the width of a little finger. This suture is known to everyone.
With this suture, a wound was stitched in a man's abdomen; he had been wounded by a knife and the wound was more than an inch wide, and about two inches of the middle intestine had protruded. The wound was in the middle of the abdomen.
I replaced it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours. The wound healed in about fifteen days, and I treated him until he recovered. He lived many years afterwards, managing all his affairs, while the physicians had judged that he would never recover at all.
And it is remarkable that I did not treat him with an ointment, because I was in a place where there were no medicines. I used to apply worn cotton to the wound twice a day and wash it with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the two kinds of special sutures, I mention it according to the words of Galen. It is that you begin the suture from the skin, and insert the needle from outside to inside. When the needle has passed through the skin and the muscle, going straight along the whole length of the abdomen.
I left the edge of the peritoneum on the side into which I inserted the needle, and passed the needle through its other edge from inside to outside, into the other edge of the peritoneum. Then, when I had passed it through, I passed it again through this same edge of the peritoneum, from outside to inside.
And leave the edge of the peritoneum on that side, and pass the needle through its other edge from inside to outside, and as you pass it through, pass it into the edge of the peritoneum which is on its side, until it passes through it entirely.
Then begin again from this same side and sew it together with the edge of the peritoneum on the other side, and bring the needle out through the skin near it. Then return it into that skin, and sew the edge of the peritoneum on the other side together with this edge of the peritoneum.
And bring it out through the skin on its side, and do that again and again, until you have sewn up the whole wound in that way. The general description of this suture is that you sew it like the sewing of furs together.
That you sew the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin and leave it once from the other side until you finish. As for the second type of special suture which Galen also mentioned, this is his exact statement.
It is that you sew it in the manner that some physicians sew it, by joining each part to its counterpart which is naturally similar to it, so that they join the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge, and the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge. This is done as I describe to you.
You should insert the needle into the edge of the peritoneum nearest to you from the outside, and pass it inwards into it alone, and leave the edges of the peritoneum. Then return the needle and pass it from the outside inwards into both edges of the peritoneum, then return it again.
And pass it from inside to outside into the other edge of the peritoneum which is on the opposite side. This type of suture is better than the easy common suture, which is the suture mentioned earlier. This is Galen's exact statement. Some have said that the suture of the abdomen may be done with two needles. That is to say, you insert one thread into them and begin by inserting the needle from your side and pass it to the other side, and insert the other needle from the opposite side and pass it to your side, according to the suture of the basket-weavers.
Know that if the wound is in the middle of the abdomen, then its suturing is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen. As for the treatment of the wound, its rule in its treatment is the rule of all other wounds. That is, if you find the wound fresh with its blood before the air changes it, and you return the intestine and sew it up and secure it, then apply to it the medicated pledgets.
If the wound has been changed by the air, then apply to it some of the ointments that you prepare until it suppurates and the threads fall out and the peritoneum and the intestines unite, then treat it as you treat other wounds until it heals.
If you do not have medicines, then apply to it, from when it begins to suppurate, old cotton and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals. For you do not need other treatment in most cases if the wounds are simple. If you fear that the wound will affect the principal organs with pain,
then it is necessary that you dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or in rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and the armpit. If he feels pain or putrefaction in his intestines—and this often happens—then inject him with a lukewarm astringent black drink.
Especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and become a penetrating wound into its cavity. And know that what is thick of the intestines is easier to heal, and what is thin of them is more difficult to heal.
And as for the intestine known as the jejunum, it does not readily heal from a wound that occurs in it at all. This is because of the abundance and size of its veins, and the thinness of its substance, and its proximity to the nature of the nerve. But if what emerges from the wound is omentum and you find it moist, then return it in the same way as you return the intestine.
If a period of time passes and it has turned green or black, then it is necessary that you tie it with a thread above the place which has blackened, lest bleeding occur, for in the omentum are veins and arteries, then cut below that ligature.
And leave the ends of the thread hanging from below the wound, outside of it, so that it is easy for you to pull it and remove it when the omentum sloughs and the wound suppurates.  Mentioning the wound which occurs in the intestine. But if a perforation occurs in the intestine and it is small,
it may heal in some people, for I have seen a man who was wounded in his abdomen by a spear thrust, and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and the wound became chronic and fistulous, discharging feces and flatus.  So I treated him, although I did not have hope for his recovery. And I continued to treat him gently until he healed and the place united. When I saw the place had united, I feared for the patient that a bad incident might occur within his abdomen, but no bad incident at all occurred to him, and he remained in the best of conditions. He correctly eats, drinks, copulates, enters the bath, and exerts himself in his service. And some experienced people have mentioned that if a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be sutured in this manner.
And it is that large-headed ants are taken, then the lips of the wound are brought together, then one of these ants, with its mouth open, is placed on the lips of the wound. When it closes and tightens its mouth, its head is cut off, for it adheres and does not come loose. Then another ant is placed near the first.
And you continue to do that with several ants according to the size of the wound, then you return it and suture the wound. For those heads remain adhering in the intestine until the intestine is healed and recovers, and no harm at all occurs to the patient. And it may also be possible to suture the intestine with fine thread.
That which is drawn from the intestine of the animal adhering to it after it is inserted into a needle is that the end of this thread from the intestine is taken and gently drawn, then a fine twisted linen thread is tied to its end, then that thread is inserted into the needle. And in it is the thread of the intestine, and with it the intestine is sutured, then it is returned to the abdomen. And this type of suturing with ants and intestine is only by way of hope and expectation.
But if the rupture is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, then there is no remedy in it, nor recovery at all.
Chapter eighty-six.
In the treatment of catarrh and fistula.
Know that every wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic and longstanding and becomes an ulcer and does not heal, and continuously discharges pus that does not stop, is called, in general, in whatever member it may be, a fistula; and we call it catarrh, and fistula.
It is, in reality, a complicated, matted, hard, white thing, with no pain accompanying it, having a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some have called it a feather; and it is sometimes moist, continuously discharging pus, and sometimes the moisture may cease; and this moisture may be abundant or scant, thick or thin.
And I have stated in the classification, when mentioning wounds, that every ulcer that does not heal and in which flesh does not grow, is so because of one of nine reasons; one of them is either because of a deficiency of blood in the body, or because of its poor quality, or because there is hard flesh inside it and on its edges which prevents the growth of good flesh. Or because it is full of pus and filth; or because the ulcer itself is foul and the matter it discharges is poor in quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable for its treatment; or because of a corruption that has occurred in the region, of the nature of an epidemic; or because of a specific characteristic of the region.
Or because it is full of pus and filth; or because the ulcer itself is foul and the matter it discharges is poor in quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable for its treatment; or because of a corruption that has occurred in the region, of the nature of an epidemic; or because of a specific characteristic of the region. As occurred in the city of Zaragoza, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of tumors is naturally slow; or because it contains one or several bones.  I have explained all these causes, their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the classification.
It is necessary here that I inform you of the treatment of fistulas and abscesses which is done by hand. Know that fistulas may occur in all parts of the body; some of them end in large veins and arteries, or in a nerve.
Or to the peritoneum, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the spine, or to a joint of the composite joints, such as the hand and foot; and some lead to the vicinity of a principal organ, and so on.
Now, those fistulas which are of this kind are among the diseases difficult to cure, which do not accept treatment, and to occupy oneself with them is weariness and ignorance. But if there are fistulas which have not reached these places which I have mentioned, and I hope and trust in their treatment,
And you wished to arrive at the knowledge of that, then take a probe of copper or iron; if the fistula runs straight, examine it with this.  If there is a curve in the fistula, examine it with a probe of thin lead, for lead is soft in its substance.
It will become smooth upon entering and will bend towards the curve. If the fistula has many openings which you cannot discover with the probe, inject one of its openings; then the moisture which you inject will pass towards the other openings and flow out.
Then complete the examination in whatever way you can, to discover if there is bone or nerve, or if the bottom of the fistula is far or near, or if it is a single fistula with many openings. Ascertain all this to the extent of your ability by questioning the patient and by observing the pain when you touch the area.
And similarly from the signs and causes which occur in the swelling.  If you have ascertained all this with certainty, then proceed to treatment with confidence.  This is that you should look, for if it is...
the fistula is apparent, near, or in a healthy place far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of the places I mentioned to you, then incise the fistula as I described before, and remove from it any adherent matter, corrupt flesh, and excess flesh.
And whatever grows in its opening of flesh or wart and the like, and treat it until it heals. If the fistula is deep-seated and straight, then you should incise it deeply as much as you can, and then cleanse it of all its corrupt flesh.
Then use a pledget of lint soaked in strong medicine and insert it into the bottom of the fistula which you can reach with an instrument; do this repeatedly until the strong medicine destroys all that remains of corruption in the bottom of the fistula.
Then treat it with ointments which cause healthy flesh to grow until it heals. If it does not heal by this, cauterize it as described before. If the cause of the fistula is bone, and this is clear to you, then probe it and incise it as I told you, if nothing prevents you from…
a nerve, or a major organ, as we said. If the bone is exposed and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until its corruption is gone, and then treat it with what will heal it until it heals. If it does not heal and the pus continues as before…
Know that you have not completely removed the corruption; expose everything again and thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with the utmost effort, then treat it. If it heals, well and good; otherwise, know that the corruption is in a deep recess. Expose everything again.
and thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with the utmost effort. If the decayed bone is small and you can pull it out, then pull it out with fine forceps suitable for this.
If there are many bones, thoroughly extract them all and do not leave any behind, to the best of your ability. If something of the ligaments obstructs you, and there is no danger in cutting them, then cut those ligaments and flesh if it is there, and free the bones.
If you cannot extract the bones at the time, apply something to the wound that will cause it to fester, and leave it for days until the flesh and ligaments around those bones fester. Keep the wound from closing, the incision that you made during your work.
Rather, if you fear that, place on it cotton soaked in powdered sulfur with oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments. For when those ligaments have festered and the bones have become loose, it will be easy to extract and pull them out.
If it is a single large bone, such as a bone of the leg or thigh, and so on, and only its surface is decayed, then scrape it thoroughly until that blackness and decay disappears, then dress the wound.  If a large part of it is decayed and the decay has reached the marrow of the bone, then it must be opened up.
And cut it all away to where the decay ends; then treat it until it heals. And I will tell you about gangrene that appeared in a man's leg, to make it an example and aid in your treatment. This man was young.
About thirty years old, he experienced pain in his leg due to a cause moving within his body until the materials reached the leg and swelled with a large swelling, and there was no external cause. Then time passed with the mistakes of the doctors until the swelling opened.
And much material flowed from it, and he was treated badly until the leg became gangrenous and many openings appeared in it, all of them discharging pus and bodily fluids. A number of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no one among them skilled in surgery.
Until they came to me. I saw his leg and the materials flowing from those openings with a great flow, and the man's body was emaciated and his color yellow.  Then I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone. Then I examined all the openings.
And I found that some of them led to others from all sides of the leg.  So I began and incised one of those openings until I uncovered some of the bone.  And I found it decayed, eroded, blackened, putrid, and perforated until the perforation reached the marrow. Then I spread what was revealed to me.
And I grasped the decayed bone. And I think that there is no decay in the bone other than that which I cut and spread, and that I have excised it. Then I proceeded to dress the wound with healing medicines for a longer period, but it did not heal. Then I returned and uncovered the bone again beyond the first uncovering.
And I found the decay connected to the bone.  Then I spread what appeared to me also of that decay. Then I attempted to dress it, but it did not heal nor unite. Then I uncovered it again, and I continued to cut the bone piece by piece and attempt to heal it, but it would not heal, until I cut about a span of bone.
And I removed it with its marrow. Then I dressed it with medicines, and it healed quickly and recovered.  And this repetition in its treatment and incision was necessary because of the weakness of the patient, his poor tolerance, and my fear for his death, because he frequently suffered from excessive vomiting and severe fainting. Then he recovered completely.
And in the place of the bone, firm flesh grew, and his condition in his body improved, and his strength returned, and he managed his affairs, and he suffered no harm whatsoever in walking. For if a prominent bone in a part of the body is broken,
it should be spread in this manner: you take a ligature and tighten it around the end of the prominent bone, and you order someone to pull it upwards, and you make another ligature of thicker wool than the first ligature.
Then you tie it to the flesh under the bone, and you pull its end so that the flesh is drawn downwards, and you uncover the flesh from the place which you want to spread, lest the saw injure the flesh, and you place a piece of wood or a board firmly under the bone from below.
Because if you do that, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the corrupt bone. And the sawing should be a little above the place of corruption, lest there be corruption in the cavity of the bone which does not appear on its surface to the senses, so that you are compelled to saw it again.
If the bone is corrupt and is not prominent, but its parts are connected to one another, and the corruption is in its middle or in some part of it, then uncover the flesh from all its sides, then place the piece of wood from below, then saw it from the first side where the corruption is.
When you have finished sawing it, saw it from the other side, and let the sawing be a little distance from the corruption, as we have said. If the corruption is in a joint, cut the corrupt joint itself and saw the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy except excision. If the corruption is in the metacarpus of the hand or the metacarpus of the foot, the matter of its treatment is very difficult, but you should peel off the corruption however it appears to you, and excise it and cleanse it in whatever way you can.
And by whatever method it is straightened for you, provided that a vein or nerve does not obstruct you. And know that the instruments and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, their setting, their thickness and thinness, their size and smallness, their hardness and porosity. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare for each type of work an instrument similar to that work.
And know that the works themselves may indicate to you the type of instrument that you need, if you have long practice and knowledge of the arts of this craft, for [it is] from the mastery of the craft and witnessing various types of diseases. He may therefore devise for himself instruments similar to [those] for each disease, and I have depicted for you at the end of this chapter several instruments.
Making them examples to be imitated and a measure by which you measure others, God willing. Image of a saw:

In the amputation of limbs and the sawing of bones.
Limbs may become putrefied, either from an external cause or from an internal cause.  If you treat this corruption with medicinal treatment and the treatment is not effective, and you see the corruption spreading in the limb, nothing restraining it,
then it is necessary to amputate that member to where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may be saved thereby from death or from a great affliction which is greater than the loss of the member. And a sign of this happening to someone is that the member turns black until you think that fire has burned it.
Or it may become putrid after the blackness, until that putrefaction spreads to what is next to that member and attacks the whole body.  Therefore hasten to cut it off.  Likewise, if the cause of the corruption is the sting of some insects, like a sea scorpion, or a snake, or a tarantula, and the like.
If the corruption or sting is in the tip of a finger, cut off the finger and do not allow the corruption to spread to the hand.  Likewise, if it has affected the hand, cut it off from the base of the forearm and do not allow the corruption to spread until it affects the bones of the arm.
Likewise, if it has affected the arm, cut off the arm at the elbow in the joint itself. If the corruption spreads and you see it reaching toward the shoulder, do not cut off the shoulder at all, for in that is the death of the patient.  And use other treatments as much as possible.
And likewise you do with the leg: if the corruption affects the toe, cut off the toe at one of the joints; and if it affects the metatarsus, cut off the whole foot; and if it ascends to the knee, cut off the leg at the knee joint.
And if the corruption has reached above the knee, there is no recourse but to leave it and abandon the patient to death.  The method of cutting off or excising a member is to tie a ligature below the place you wish to cut off, and tie another ligature above the place.
And one assistant pulls the lower ligature downwards, and another assistant pulls the upper ligature upwards, and you yourself dissect the flesh between the ligatures with a broad scalpel until all the flesh is exposed, then it is cut or excised. And it is necessary that you place linen cloths on all sides.
Lest the saw touch the healthy tissue, causing the patient additional pain and hot inflammation. If bleeding occurs during your work, cauterize the area quickly or apply some styptic powder, then return to your treatment until you finish.
Then bind the injured member with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. And I will tell you of an example which occurred in a man's leg, this very condition which I describe to you: that is to say, there appeared in his leg blackness with burning like fire.
And this corruption first appeared in his toe, until it took the whole leg.  So the man, of his own accord, when he saw the corruption spreading in the limb, with the intensity of the pain and burning he felt, cut it off at the joint, and he recovered.
Then, after a long time, the same corruption appeared in the index finger of his hand. He came to me, and I sought to restrain that corruption with the medicaments I applied to the hand after cleansing his body.  But the corruption did not abate and proceeded to the other finger.
Until the corruption seized the hand, and he urged me to amputate his hand. But I refused, hoping to restrain the corruption, and fearing also for his life if I amputated his hand, because the man's strength was failing.  When he despaired of me, he departed to his own country.
Then news came to me that he had, of his own accord, amputated his whole hand and recovered. And I have recounted this story to be of help in cases of this kind of disease, and to be a guide to follow and act upon.
Chapter Eighty-Eight.
On the treatment of fistulas and how to inject them with medicaments.
If a swelling occurs in one of the fleshy members, and the duration of the swelling is prolonged until it gathers pus, then bursts or is lanced, and all the pus within it comes out, and the place remains empty like a vessel.
And the skin over it is like a rag, thinned, and its corruption has not affected the bone, nor the nerve, nor the ligament.  Therefore it deserves to be called a fistula, and not a sinus, unless its duration is prolonged until the corruption affects something of these members.
Then it is called a sinus or a fistula, and its treatment is to cut away all that skin as it goes around, especially if it has thinned and become like a rag, and you are certain that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
But if you hope that the skin will adhere, and its corruption has not reached that extent, and there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with injection. This is to look at the fistula; if it is large and the pus that flows from it is foul-smelling, then inject it with the Egyptian medicine.
which is vinegar, oil, honey, and verdigris in equal parts, gathered in a vessel and cooked over the fire until the medicine thickens and reaches the consistency of honey. Then take what you need of it, thin it with water and honey, and inject it into the fistula, and bind its mouth, and leave the medicine in it for about two hours.
Then remove it by pressing; do this for several days until the fistula is cleansed and the stench is gone.  It may also be injected with ash water if this medicine is not available to you.  This is to take the ash of grapevine wood or the ash of oak wood and pour water over it.
Then filter it and inject it until you are certain that the fistula has been washed. If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, then inject it with water and honey in which some powdered verdigris has been mixed.
Or inject it with honey and syrup mixed, for honey cleanses and washes, and syrup adheres to the fistula, especially if the syrup has astringent and drying properties.  When you have done this several times and are certain that the corruption of the fistula has gone, then inject it with something that will grow flesh in it.
Such as taking some palm ointment and dissolving it in rose oil and an astringent syrup, or inject it with some of the other medicines and ointments whose properties we have described in the chapter on ointments. If the mouth of the fistula is narrow and does not admit the injection tube,
widen it slightly with an iron instrument, or place in it a pledget soaked in Egyptian ointment or theriac ointment until it widens.  Similarly, if the opening is also wide, bring its edges together with sutures, leaving only enough space for the injection tube to enter, no more.
Similarly, if the opening from which the pus flows is high up, make an incision in the lowest part of it so that the pus flows downwards, for if pus is retained in the depths of the fistula, it prevents the growth of flesh there.
If you cannot incise the fistula downwards as you wish, then position the limb so that the pus flows easily from it, as seems best to you, so that no pus at all is retained in it.
As for the agglutinative medicines which are applied externally to the fistula, and the manner of applying them, take one of the agglutinative ointments similar to what you want, and spread it on a linen cloth; let the cloth be large enough to cover the entire fistula. Then cut with scissors opposite the opening of the fistula a hole slightly larger than the fistula's opening.  Then spread some soft ointment on another cloth, to the size of the hole, and place it there, keeping it away from the fistula's opening so that the pus may easily escape.  Do not remove the larger cloth until later.
several days; as for that on the opening of the fistula, remove it at all times so that what has collected there of pus may come out, and so that you may know what flows from it of pus—whether it is much or little, mature or immature.
Along with this also, examine the fistula itself: does its owner feel pain in it, or is there no pain?  Is there swelling, or not? If your treatment continues thus, and you see the material that comes out is slight at the opening of the fistula,
know that the fistula has adhered or is close to adhering. Then, resolve it on the morrow or on the third day. And when you have opened the wound, change the cloths to others, and renew the ointment.  If after a long time thin pus comes out of the fistula, do not despair of its closing.
Its healing is near, for some people are slow in the growth of flesh in their wounds, and others the opposite. If after many days there comes out from the fistula immature pus, know that the fistula has not closed. If the fistula is slow to close,
and its matter is prolonged, increase the drying medications, and let them be medications that are moist in their consistency and dry in their strength, like palm ointment if an excess of  colocynth has been added to it.  Among the most effective things to treat it with is to take palm ointment.
and mix it with rose oil, and sprinkle on it aged wine of moderate consistency, then knead it with it and use it.  He may do this same action if palm ointment is not available to you: if you cook honey until it boils and use it, or take myrrh, aloe, and costus, crush them all together, and sprinkle them on the honey while it is on the fire. Then spread it on a cloth and bind it to the fistula, or it is spread with the honey that you cooked until it thickens, and sprinkle on it the drugs and place on it the cloths and bind it.
Long rhubarb, the root of the asphodel, pounded  cress, and centaury may be used in such a case, singly or together, crushed and sifted, and sprinkled on the honey described above and used. If the matter of the fistula is prolonged and it does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption in its depth.
And if it has affected the bones or other hard nerves or ligaments, treat it as a fistula, as described above.
Chapter Eighty-Nine.
On the treatment of the felon, the injured nail, the amputation of the superfluous finger, and the separation of adherent fingers.
A felon is an excessive growth of flesh under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot, and sometimes it grows in the other fingers. If its matter is prolonged and its treatment neglected, it swells into a hot tumor.
Or it becomes corrupt and purulent until it eats away the root of the nail, and perhaps all of it, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul smell and the end of the finger becomes broad and its color livid.  If you treat it with what we mentioned in the section and your treatment is not effective,
it is necessary to cut off with an iron instrument all the excess that grows from the nail, then cauterize the wound afterwards; for cauterization is very beneficial in this case, but if the bone is sound and the nail is also sound,
and the corner containing the nail has constricted the flesh inwards, causing it to pinch and injure it, it is necessary to place a thin probe under the corner of the nail that pinches the flesh and lift it upwards and cut that flesh gently.
And you should apply to what remains of the flesh of the cauterizing corrosives until it is all gone, then treat it with ointments until it heals. But if the corruption has affected the bone, it is necessary to cut that bone and remove it, for it will not heal as long as there is corrupt bone at all.
If you see the erosion and corruption spreading in the finger, cut it off at one of the joints as previously mentioned, then treat it until it heals. If the nail is struck or bruised and severe pain occurs in it, it is necessary to bleed the patient first.
Then you should incise the nail with a sharp scalpel, an oblique incision from above downwards, and be careful not to reach with the incision to the flesh under the nail, for you will thereby cause the patient severe pain and it will be a cause of excess flesh growing in the place, then treat the place with what alleviates pain.
As for the extra finger that grows in some people's hands, it may be entirely fleshy, or it may have bones in it, or it may have a nail, and the growth of some of them is at the root of the joint of some fingers.
Or its growth may be in some of the finger joints.  Those that grow in some of the finger joints do not move, and those that grow at the finger joint may move. As for that which is only fleshy, its cutting is easy, and that is to cut it at its base with a wide scalpel.
As for that whose growth is at the root of the joint, its treatment is difficult, so avoid cutting it. As for that which grows in the finger at one of the joints, it is necessary to first cut its flesh in a circular cut to the bone, then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for that.
Then treat it until it heals. As for the adhesion that occurs between the fingers, it often occurs.  This may be from birth, or from the healing of a wound, a burn, or something similar. It is necessary to incise that adhesion.
Until the fingers return to their natural state. Then place between them a pledget or strip soaked in rose oil, lest it quickly adhere. Separate them, or place a thin lead plate between them until the area heals properly.
Similarly, if adhesion occurs between some of the fingers and the palm, incise that adhesion according to what is appropriate and improves the shape of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
On the excision of polyps.
Polyps are thick, twisted veins filled with dark, stagnant blood. They occur in most parts of the body, most commonly in the legs, especially in the legs of those who carry burdens, such as porters and carriers.  First, strong rubbing of the body with black bile should be used repeatedly.
Then, bleed the patient from the basilic vein. As for treating them with iron instruments, there are two methods: one is to incise and remove the black blood; the other is to extract the vein and remove it entirely. As for incision, it is done in this manner: first, bathe the leg with warm water thoroughly.
Until the thick, turbid blood is softened. Then, tie the patient's leg from above the thigh to below the knee with a bandage. Then, incise the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then, draw out the black blood with your hand, from the lower leg upwards and from the upper leg downwards, until you have removed the amount of blood you deem sufficient, or as much as the patient's strength can bear. Then, bandage it and instruct him to avoid foods that produce black bile.  The purging and bloodletting should be repeated.
When the veins are filled and this harms the patient. As for extraction, it is done in this manner: shave the patient's leg if it has much hair. Then, take him to the bathhouse and bathe his leg with hot water until it reddens and sweats, or he performs vigorous exercise.
If a bathhouse is not available, heat the limb. Then, incise the skin along the vein, either at its end near the knee or at its lower end near the heel. Then, open the skin with hooks and dissect the vein from all sides until it is perceptible to the touch.
When it appears, you will see it as dark red. Once it is freed from the skin, it will appear like a tendon. Then, insert a probe underneath it until, when it is raised and emerges from the skin, you hang it on a smooth, blunt hook. Then, make another incision near that incision, about three fingers wide.
Then, dissect the skin from over the vein until it appears. Then, lift it with the probe as you did before and hang it on another hook as you did initially. Then, make another incision, or many incisions if necessary.
Then, extract it and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel. Then, pull and extract it until it emerges from the second incision. Then, pull it to the incision above it and do this until you pull it from the third incision, the highest of all the incisions, until, when it is all out, you cut it.
If it does not yield to pulling and extraction, insert a needle with strong doubled thread, tie it, and pull. Insert the probe underneath and twist it with your hand in every direction until it comes out. Be careful that it does not break, for if it breaks, its extraction will become very difficult for you.
And harm will befall the patient from it. When you have extracted it all, place wool soaked in a potion and rose oil or olive oil on the site of the incisions, and treat it until it heals. If the varix is constricted with convolutions and a twisting towards different directions,
and is not straight as we said, then it is necessary that you incise it at each part of its convolutions and places of twisting, then hang it with hooks until you extract it all. And be careful when incising it that you do not cut or injure the vein, for this will make its extraction difficult for you, so exert yourself carefully.
Image of the incision with which the varix is incised.
Image of the blind hook.
It should not be hooked like other hooks, nor should it be sharp-pointed, lest it injure the vein. It should be thick, smoothly curved, for if it is thin, it will cut the vein with its thinness; rather, it should have a considerable thickness, as we said.
Chapter ninety-one.
On the removal of the varicose vein.
This vein originates in the legs in hot countries like the Hejaz and the lands of the Arabs, and in hot, arid countries with little fertility.  It may also originate in other parts of the body besides the legs, and its generation is due to an infection that occurs under the skin.
As happens in the interior of bodies with snakes and worms, and the gourd’s [i.e., pumpkin’s] ulcer and the worms generated between the skin and the flesh.  The sign of the beginning of this vein’s occurrence is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg, then the place suppurates, then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that suppuration.
As if it were the root of a plant or animal; so when its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing from one to two dirhams, and tied, leaving the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever something emerges from it to the outside, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it becomes very long, cut some of it and wrap the remainder; do not cut it from its root before it has all emerged, for if you cut it, it will contract and enter the flesh, causing a swelling and corruption in the place and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be treated carefully and pulled out little by little until it is completely removed and nothing of it remains in the body.  From this vein, in some people, something may emerge that is five or ten cubits in length.
And it has reached me that it emerged from a man at twenty cubits.  If it breaks for you while you are treating it, insert a probe into its hole and probe it thoroughly along with the body until all that is in it of matter is emptied, and try purifying the place with medicines for days.
Then treat it with the treatment for tumors. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in the joint of the leg or in the leg itself, producing many openings, and from each opening a branch emerges. Treat it as we mentioned in the classification and as previously described.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
Concerning the incision for the worm that is generated under the ear and is called the cow's disease.
This disease is called in some of our countries the cow's disease, because it often affects cows. It is a single, small worm that is generated between the skin and the flesh, and moves throughout the body, ascending and descending.
It is perceived by touch as it moves from one member to another until it breaks through the skin at some point and emerges.  Its formation is from the corruption of some humors, as happens with worms, snakes, and the gourd-like growth in the abdomen.
The harm to be expected from it is that if it moves in the body and ascends to the head and reaches the eye, it may break into it and emerge, destroying the eye. This often occurs. If you want to treat it and remove it, this is done when it is moving and is perceptible to the touch.
Then it is necessary to tie what is above and below it tightly with a bandage, then incise over it and remove it. If it has sunk into the flesh and you cannot find it, apply cautery with fire to the area until you burn it. The greatest harm to be expected from it is its damage to the eye, as we have said.
If you see that it has reached the head near the eye, then tie tightly below it on the forehead, then incise over it and remove it.  The patient should be treated with purgative medicines to cleanse the body of bad, corrupt humors, and should be careful to avoid foods that produce corruption.
Chapter Ninety-Three.
Concerning the incision for the disease known as the ulcer.
This disease, which in our country is called *nafir*, is a pain that appears in some organs and then moves from one organ to another. I have seen it as I describe to you.
I was called to a sick woman in the desert. She uncovered her arm and showed me a slight swelling in a vein of the forearm. After a short time, I saw that swelling moving along the ulna like a worm, ascending to her shoulder as quickly as possible, like mercury.
As it moved from place to place, the pain disappeared from that spot and settled in the shoulder. Then, after a while, it ran throughout the body until it reached the other arm. Then she told me that it circulated throughout her entire body, as I had witnessed.
I was amazed at the speed of its movement from one organ to another. I had never before seen this disease with my own eyes in this way, except that I had seen people whose pain moved from one organ to another, but I had not seen it with my own eyes as I saw it in this woman.
I could only explain it by the fact that the woman was a desert dweller, with a dry body and exposed veins; therefore, that moving wind was perceptible.  It would not appear in the same way in people of comfort, with moist bodies and hidden veins.
If you want to treat it, and the patient feels pain, and if it appears to you visibly as we have mentioned, then bind above and below it with a bandage and incise it until that congested wind escapes, and cauterize the place.
If you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it by means of things that dispel and disperse the wind, such as the seeds of rue and the seeds of  *skombion* and similar medicines.
Chapter ninety-four.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows differ according to their types and according to the places in the body where they lodge. As for their differences according to their types, there are large and small ones, hollow glass ones and solid glass ones, and some have three points and some have four.
Some have barbs and some have splinters. As for those according to the members in which they lodge, they are of two kinds: either they are in principal hollow members such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like; if an arrow lodges in one of these members and you see the signs of death which I shall describe to you later, then you should avoid extracting that arrow from it, for in most instances death will overtake the patient. But if these bad signs do not appear and the arrow is not hidden deep within the member, then extract it and treat the wound.  And of the signs [of injury to] the brain, if an arrow strikes it and penetrates the bone and wounds the membrane covering the brain, then there results from that a severe headache, shivering, and dizziness.
But if these bad signs do not appear and the arrow is not hidden deep within the member, then extract it and treat the wound.  And of the signs [of injury to] the brain, if an arrow strikes it and penetrates the bone and wounds the membrane covering the brain, then there results from that a severe headache, shivering, and dizziness. and redness in the eyes and redness of the tongue, convulsions, delirium, vomiting, and perhaps blood comes from the nostrils or ears, and perhaps speech is lost and the voice is gone, and a white moisture resembling gruel comes from the place of the wound, and a watery substance like the water of flesh flows from it.
If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treating the patient and from extracting the arrow if it has not been extracted. As for the signs [of an arrow] striking the heart, if it is near the left breast and you feel it as if it were driven into something solid and not into something empty;
and perhaps the arrow has a movement resembling the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and this is followed by coldness of the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting; then know that death is inevitable. And a sign of the arrow if it wounds the lung is the discharge of frothy blood from the wound.
And the vessels next to the neck swell, and the color of the patient changes, and he breathes heavily and desires to inhale cool air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm which is in the chest, then it will be near the small ribs, and the breathing will be labored with severe pain.
And he sighs and all the members of the shoulders move. And if the arrow strikes the liver, severe pain follows and blood resembling the liver in its redness comes from the wound. And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from the food comes from the wound.
And its condition is evident. And if the arrow strikes the abdomen and becomes embedded in it, and something of the excrement, or pus, or intestine which has been ruptured comes from the wound, then there is no hope in treating it or in extracting the arrow. If the arrow strikes the bladder and urine comes out;
and something protrudes from it to the outside and the pain intensifies for the patient, then know that he is dying. As for the other members, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, vertebrae of the back, clavicle, thigh, leg, and similar members, they are mostly unharmed.
When the arrow does not encounter an artery or nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned. And I tell you some of what I have witnessed concerning these arrows so that you may thereby be guided in your treatment. That is, an arrow once struck a man in the corner of his eye at the root of the nose.
So I extracted it for him from the other side under the lobe of the ear, and he recovered and no harm befell his eye. And I extracted another arrow for a Jew which had struck him in the lobe of his eye under the lower eyelid, and the arrow had hidden itself, and I grasped only its small point which is attached to the wood.
And it was a large arrow from the composite arrows, square-headed iron, smooth, without barbs.  The Jew recovered and no ill befell his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabic.
and it is the one with barbs, so I made an incision for him between the two jugulars, and it had sunk into his throat. So I gently worked at it until I extracted it, and the Christian was safe and recovered. And I extracted another arrow for a man which had struck him in the abdomen, and we judged that he would die from it.
But when thirty days or so had passed, and nothing in his condition had changed, I made an incision over the arrow and worked at it and extracted it, and he recovered and no ill befell him. And I saw a man struck by an arrow in his back, and the wound had closed over it.
Then after seven years the arrow emerged at the root of her thigh. And I saw a woman who had been struck in her abdomen by an arrow, and the wound had closed, and the arrow remained, and nothing in her condition changed, nor did she experience any harm from it in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man struck by an arrow in his face, and the wound closed and he felt little pain from it. And there are many similar cases. And I extracted an arrow for a man, one of the Sultan's guards, which had struck him in the middle of his nose, inclining slightly to the right side.
And the whole arrow was hidden. I was called to treat him three days after the arrow struck. I found the arrow wound very narrow, so I explored it with a thin probe, but I did not feel it. He felt a stinging pain under his ear on the right side of the incision.
I hoped that this stinging pain was from the arrowhead, so I dressed the wound with a dressing possessing drawing and ripening power, hoping that the area would swell and the arrowhead would appear, so that I could incise it. But nothing happened in the area to indicate that the arrow had reached that place.
I continued the dressing for many days, but nothing happened. Then the wound closed, and the patient despaired of its removal for a time, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and told me.  So I applied a strong, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened, and I probed it, and I felt the thin point of the arrow that adheres to the wood. Then I increased the opening of the wound with that strong medicine until the arrowhead appeared to us clearly.  It took about four months.
Then, when the wound widened and I was able to insert forceps into it, I pulled and moved it, but it did not yield to removal.  I continued to gently manipulate it and devise ways with various instruments until one day I grasped it firmly with forceps, as its image appears at the end of the chapter.
And the physicians judged that the cartilage of his nose would not heal, but I healed it, and the wound united, and the patient recovered completely, without any harm whatsoever.  And I tell you the method of removing some arrows so that you may use this as a measure and guide for what I have not mentioned.
Because the parts of this craft and its details cannot be grasped by description nor encompassed by a book.  Rather, the skilled craftsman judges by the little from the much, and by what is present from what is absent, and he deduces a new action and a new instrument for strange emergencies.
If we descend to this craft, then I say that arrows are removed from the members in which they are lodged in two ways: either by pulling from the place where they entered, or from the opposite direction, and those that are removed from where they entered.
Either the arrow is protruding in a fleshy place, and it is pulled and removed. If it does not yield to removal from the place where it lodged, then you should leave it for several days until the flesh around it putrefies, so that it is easy to pull and remove.  Likewise if it is lodged in a bone.
And if it does not yield to removal, leave it also for days and return to pulling and moving it every day, for it will come out.  If it does not yield to removal after days, then you should bore around the arrow in the bone itself from every direction with a fine drill until you widen [the hole] for the arrow, then pull and remove it.
If the arrow lodged in the bone of the head has penetrated deeply into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those symptoms I mentioned to you appear in the patient, then refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it until its condition improves after several days.
then persevere in pulling out the arrow. If it is very firmly lodged and does not yield to pulling, then use the drills around the arrow as I described to you, then treat the place until it heals.  And if the arrow has disappeared in a place of the body, and is hidden from sensation, then probe for it with a probe. If you feel it, pull it with some instrument suitable for pulling it. If you cannot reach it because of the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrow, and there is neither bone, nor nerve, nor vein,
then incise it until the wound widens and you can reach the arrow so that you extract it. If it has barbs, grasp them, and free the flesh entangled in them from every side by any means you can. Persevere, and if you cannot free the flesh, break the barbs and twist them until you free it.
And when you attempt to extract the arrow, wherever it may be, use the twisting of your hand with forceps in all directions until you free it. Be extremely gentle, lest the arrow break and it becomes difficult for you to pull it out. If you cannot manage it at the time,
leave it for some days until the flesh around it becomes putrid, then try again; for it will then be easier. If bleeding occurs, use what we mentioned of treatment in its chapter, and take care to avoid cutting a vein, nerve, or tendon; use skill.
By any means you can, free the arrow; let this be done gently and carefully and firmly, as I described to you. It is necessary that when you pull out the arrow, you position the patient in the same manner he was in when the arrow entered, for this is most appropriate.
If you cannot do this, use whatever positions you can. As for an arrow which emerges from the opposite side, either a part of it will have emerged externally, or you will feel the tip of the arrow just beneath the skin, near the surface, and see it protruding.
Make an incision over it; let the incision be sufficient for the forceps to grasp it, then pull it out, for it will easily come out. If it is stuck in a bone, twist your hand circularly until the arrow affects the bone and makes space for itself, then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for some days, then try again until it comes out. If the arrow shaft is still there, push it with it. If the shaft has fallen off and you wish to use pushing, then insert the hollow instrument so that its cavity enters the end of the arrow, then push it with that.
If the arrow is hollow, push it with an instrument that enters that cavity, for the arrow will easily come out by this means. If the arrow is poisoned, you should cauterize all the flesh into which the poison has entered, if you can, then treat it with what is suitable for that.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the abdomen, or in the bladder, or in the flank, and it is near enough to be felt with a probe, and you can incise over it, then incise and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Then suture the wound if it needs stitching, then treat it until it heals.  Image of the forceps with which arrows are extracted:
Their ends are like a bird's beak; they are made like a file, so that when they grasp the arrow or anything, they do not let go.  And various sizes, large, small and medium, may be made of them, each according to the size of the arrow, and the width and narrowness of the wound.
Image of the hollow pusher:
Image of the solid pusher:
This has a solid end like an awl, to make it easier to insert into the hollow arrow and push it.
Chapter ninety-five.
On the incision of veins.
The veins which it is customary to bleed in the body are thirty veins; of these, sixteen are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as the "whispering" veins, and the two arteries in the temples which are visible, and the two veins in the corners of the eyes known as the "seeing" veins.
And the vein rising in the middle of the forehead, and the vein which is at the tip of the nose, and the two jugular veins in the neck, and the two veins in the upper lip of the mouth, and the two veins in the lower lip – these veins are known as the "jeharak" – and the two veins under the tongue.
As for the veins which are bled in the arm and hand, they are five veins: one of them is the cephalic, which is on the outer side, and the common people call it the "head vein," and the median vein which is the middle vein and is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, and the common people call it the "body vein.
And the basilic, which is situated on the inner side and is also called the axillary, and the common people call it the "belly vein," and the vein of the forearm, which is situated on the ulna, and which adheres to it, and which appears clearly above the thumb, and the salem.
And this is the vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger; it has two branches. And in the leg and foot there are three veins: one of them is that which is below the hollow of the knee on the outer side, and the second is the saphenous, and its place is at the heel on the inner side, and the vein of the nerves, and its place is at the heel on the outer side.
And in the other leg there are three veins similar to them. As for the two veins behind the ears, the benefit of bleeding them is for chronic colds, migraine, ringworm, and chronic, bad sores of the head, and their method of bleeding is as I describe.
And that is to shave the head of the patient and rub his head well in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth, then the patient's neck is constricted with a turban until the two veins and their location appear behind the ears in the two low places of the head, then you should feel them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, there you should mark with ink.
Then you take a lancet-like scalpel, which is known as the *nashal*, then you insert it under the vein in the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone, then you lift your hand with the vein and skin upwards and cut the vein with the skin a cleanly severed cut, and the length of the cut should be the amount of two joined fingers.
Or something similar, and you let out the amount of blood that you want, then you bind them with bandages and leave them until they heal.  And the cutting of them and their method has been mentioned in the beginning of the book. As for the two arteries which are in the temples, the benefit of bleeding them is for chronic migraine, severe headache, persistent ophthalmia, and sharp, excessive flow of humors into the eyes.
And their method of bleeding is as I describe to you: the patient’s neck is constricted with a turban until the veins appear clearly to the touch and their pulse is apparent under your finger; then you mark with ink. Then you lift the skin from above the vein upwards with your index finger.
And you insert the *nashal* scalpel from below and lift the vein upwards and sever it as you did with the other two veins, and you let out blood according to your need, then you loosen the constriction of the patient's neck and place your finger on the vein for a while.
Then you place cotton and a bandage on it and bind it tightly from above and leave it until it heals.  Their mention, cutting, and cauterization have been detailed at the beginning of the book. As for bleeding the vein of the forehead, its benefit, after bleeding the temporal veins, is for chronic facial ailments such as ringworm, sores, and erysipelas.
And its method of bleeding, as I describe to you: you constrict the patient's neck with a turban until the vein appears; then you take the instrument called the axe, and this is its image:
You place the projecting spike which is in the head of the axe on the vein itself and strike from above with a comb or something similar, and you let the blood flow to the extent you desire; then you loosen the constriction of the patient’s neck and bandage him until he heals.
And it may be opened with a wide scalpel, except that the scalpel should not be sharp-pointed like other scalpels, but rather slightly wide-ended, and you incise it obliquely, because the bone is near, and the scalpel may break in it if it is thin.
As for the two veins in the temples, their benefit is for eye ailments such as ringworm, inflammation, and cataracts, and facial diseases. As for their method of bleeding, it is that the patient's neck is constricted with a turban, then you bleed them while you are standing over his head; and let the incision be slightly oblique lengthwise with a small, slightly wide scalpel.
For there is no flesh in that area; if the scalpel is thin-pointed, it may break. Then you let out the amount of blood you need and place cotton on them and bind them for one night, then unbind them.  As for bleeding the vein of the nose, it is beneficial for acute fevers.
And severe headache and facial diseases such as the red erysipelas which appears in the nose, especially if it is chronic.  The method of bleeding it is that the patient constricts his neck, then you hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long scalpel.
And you pierce it in the middle of the nasal tip itself, between the nasal septum, straightly, because the vein does not appear to the touch there, for the blood will emerge immediately.  You should push your hand with the scalpel slightly and let out the amount of blood you need, then bind it for a night, for it clots quickly.
As for the jugular veins, the benefit of bleeding them is for shortness of breath, the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic diseases which appear on the surface of the skin, such as black vitiligo, ringworm, bad ulcers and sores.  The method of bleeding them is that the patient is constricted beneath them in his neck with a ligature, and the surgeon stands at the head of the patient.
And the patient sits on a chair, then you bleed the vein lengthwise with a somewhat wide incision, then you let out a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you see as necessary. Then you do likewise with the other vein, then you untie the ligature.
And you constrict the two veins moderately, lest the patient suffocate, and you leave him until the next day, for the wound will heal. As for the veins of the temples, the benefit of bleeding them, after bleeding the head, is that it benefits from canker sores in the mouth, corruption of the gums, bad ulcers, cracking of the lips and bad ulcers.
which are in and around the nose.  The method of bleeding them is that you seat the patient before you and constrict his neck with a turban, then you turn back his lips and look at the two veins, one of which you see to the right of the lip and the other to the left of it, and you ascertain them by their blackness.
And that is also because around them are small, black veins; you cut them with a severed cut. If it is difficult for you and you do not know what they are, then aim to cut the largest and most obvious of them.  Likewise, do you act in the veins which are in the lower lip.
As for the two veins which are under the tongue, the benefit of bleeding them after bleeding the head is for the quinsy which occur in the throat from disease of the uvula and diseases of the mouth. The method of bleeding them is that you seat the patient between your hands facing the sun and raise his tongue and look under the tongue, on one side a vein and on the other side a vein, and their color is towards blackness.
Then you bleed them, and be careful not to exaggerate in cutting them, for beneath them are arteries, and perhaps there will result a bleeding of blood from those arteries. As for the three veins which are bled in the elbow, they are those in which the custom has been to bleed them in all people, and their bleeding is done in two ways.
Either by insertion with a wide,  lanceolate or olive-shaped scalpel to the depth, or by incision with a knife-shaped scalpel, which is the lancet [and this is its picture], a picture of the wide lanceolate scalpel:
It is wide as you see, so that it is suitable for opening hollow, full, prominent, apparent, thick veins which contain thick, turbid blood. And this is a picture of the olive-shaped scalpel:
And this scalpel is less wide and thinner at the tip, suitable for bleeding thin veins which contain thin, yellowish blood. And this is a picture of the lancet scalpel:
This lancet which is suitable for incision, and there are types of it, wide and narrow, according to the size and narrowness of the veins also. And one may infer from this to others, and it is well-known among the artisans.
As for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of bleeding it is that it draws blood from the illnesses which are under the throat and neck, from what is near the chest and abdomen. It is necessary for the phlebotomist, when bleeding it, to be cautious and be on the alert, for under it is an artery; if he makes a mistake and goes too deep with the scalpel, he will cut that artery.
Then bleeding occurs, therefore it is necessary that its bleeding should not be done with the incision scalpel, but its bleeding should be an incision with the lancet. If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary to avoid it and turn to another, or seek some of its branches.
Or bleed in its place the vein of the arm, for it is clear, and incise it with the lancet scalpel as we said. If you wish to bleed it itself, then before tightening the arm, it is necessary to feel the place until you recognize the place of the pulse, then mark it with ink.
Then you bind the arm and incise the vein with a sharp incision with the lancet scalpel as we said, and take care that the incision is away from the place of the artery. And when you see, upon tightening the ligature, a swelling in the place which you marked with ink, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see the blood, at the time of bleeding, spurt like the urine of a boy, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is from the artery. Then immediately place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger. If the blood stops, and it often stops, then tighten the arm.
And leave it, and warn the patient against neglecting it, and let him be on his back and not move for several days until it heals. If the blood does not stop and overcomes you, and you do not have medicine at hand, then amputate the artery if it appears to you, for its ends contract and the blood stops.
Or take a pistachio shell and split it, and take one half and bind it tightly on the place of the vein with a ligature and bandages until the next day. If the blood stops, otherwise treat it with what was previously mentioned of placing styptics, and stopping its blood is not difficult in most cases.
Because of the smallness of the wound and the tightness of the ligature on the arm, let him know. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of bleeding it is that it draws blood from the top of the head and the lower body, because it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, as we said.
And it is necessary for the one who bleeds him to be on his back when bleeding him, for there is a nerve beneath it. If he exceeds in the insertion of the lancet and hits the nerve, numbness occurs in it which is difficult to cure, and perhaps it will not heal at all.  And this nerve is often perceptible to the touch.
If it is hidden in some people and is thin and not apparent, then you should make your incision in it obliquely and avoid the nerve as much as possible. If the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of bleeding it is that it draws blood from the head.
And it benefits from diseases of the eyes, and it is necessary in this vein especially, if you wish to bleed it, to insert the olive-shaped lancet or the wide, basil-shaped lancet, because it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
Except that it is necessary for you, when bleeding, to avoid only the head of the muscle with the lancet and seek the soft place.  It does not harm him if he is not hit by the first strike to be bled again several times, except that it might swell in some people if it is not bled on the first strike.
But that swelling does not harm him at all. As for the manner of bleeding and its complications and what should precede in its treatment, first of all you should know that bleeding is either used only to preserve health.
And either it is used in diseases, and that which is used to preserve health and maintain it and to guard against the occurrence of diseases is that bleeding should be in one of the three veins in the elbow, I mean the cephalic, the median, and the basilic, and that bleeding should be in early spring if signs of plethora appear.
And the bleeding should be on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours of the day have passed.  As for the bleeding that is used in diseases, it does not have a limited time, but whenever need and necessity require it, day or night.
And at every hour and at every time.  And children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years, nor should the elderly who have passed sixty years be bled.  If someone intends to bleed, for whatever reason.
Then he should cleanse his bowels before bleeding with a gentle enema if there is much retained feces, lest putrid excess from the intestines be drawn into the veins during bleeding, harming the principal organs. And he should not bleed the feverish, nor the drunkard, nor the intoxicated until that passes from them.
And bleeding should also be avoided after dysentery, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive coitus, exertion, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, and everything that weakens the strength, whether physical or mental. Then look to the thinning of the humors beforehand if the blood is thick.
With foods, drinks, and medicines if he can, then he enters the bath if nothing prevents him, or he engages in some exercise so that the blood is thinned, and he makes his bleeding in the middle of the day as we said, and he intends to free his chest that day from all bad psychological effects.
Such as worries, anger, and fear, and from all physical effects such as excessive exertion and fatigue, coitus, and the like.  And he prepares for his session things that people are accustomed to using, such as various perfumes, fragrant herbs, amusements, and the like, each person according to what he can.
Then the phlebotomist sits on a cushion higher than the cushion on which the patient sits, then he extends his arm and the phlebotomist rubs it with his hand two or three times, then he tightens the ligature with the fillet and twists it two or three times, and let the tightening be moderate.
Because if the tightening is not moderate, either by excessive tightening, it prevents the flow of blood, or if it is relaxed, it also prevents the flow of blood. Then after tightening, it is necessary for the patient to rub both his hands together.
Until the veins swell and become perceptible to the touch, then the phlebotomist wipes the lancet with a little old oil, especially, then he places the index finger of his left hand on the vein itself, slightly below the place he wants to bleed, lest the vein slip away and avoid the incision. For some veins are found like a tendon, slipping away during phlebotomy, and some are filled with wind, so when the lancet is placed on them, they sink under the lancet and deceive the phlebotomist, and the lancet does not open the vein, and if it does open it, it is only a narrow opening.
Therefore, the phlebotomist should be careful and patient in all these matters, then he lowers the lancet; if the vein opens at that time, otherwise, he repeats it again slightly below or above that place quickly if the place is not swollen.
If the patient swells or is distressed, leave him for a day or two and do not tighten the ligature, for it may cause a hot swelling and do not let him enter the bath, then he may repeat the phlebotomy if he wishes.  If the lancet is inserted and the opening is small and the flow of blood is thin.
And you fear that the desired amount of blood will not come out, then return the lancet into the same hole gently and straight, and increase the opening slightly, and do that quickly before the place swells, for in many people the place may swell with a small opening.
If you see that it has swollen, do not repeat it at all, for it will not help you; place something of oil dregs on it, for it facilitates the flow of blood, and it is better in this place than the oil itself and other ointments as well.
Therefore, use oil dregs in all your phlebotomies when the flow of blood is difficult; and the theriac Pharun and the shakhsanaya may do that if one of them is placed on the place, for the blood becomes thin and dissolves if it is thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of phlebotomy – and this often happens, especially to one who has been phlebotomized only that one time or if the opening of the vein was small – then hasten to place on the swelling a sponge soaked in slightly warmed salt water and bind it for an hour, for it will resolve.
And it is necessary that you do this after the complete exit of blood from the vein itself or from another vein; if something of blackness or greenness remains in the place after days, it does not harm; if you wish, apply something of dissolved aloes and myrrh to it.
Or something of the juice of the foudanj and the like.  Often a swelling and a pustule occur when phlebotomizing the basilic vein; place your hand on it; if you find it softens when you touch it, then that is a bad pustule, so beware of putting anything on it of what we mentioned.
For perhaps arterial blood will bleed from it, but bandage it with something constricting to solidify the place, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.  And it is necessary that you extract from each person blood according to his strength and what appears of the color predominating in the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it reddens; and likewise if you see it thick, let it flow until it thins; and likewise if it is acrid, until its acridity goes away.  And it is necessary for one who is full-bodied and strong and needs to have blood extracted all at once…
…to widen the phlebotomy and the lancet to be wide; and for one who is weak, the opposite of that. And it is necessary that you extract it in several times, and that the hole be narrow. And the best thing to use in phlebotomy is that which is sharp, well-honed, incised, not punctured.
And this type of phlebotomy is safe from bleeding and from cutting a nerve; and it is better and safer than phlebotomy across and lengthwise. And whoever is accustomed to fainting during phlebotomy, it is necessary that you give him to eat before phlebotomy something of bread soaked in pomegranate water or oxymel.
If he is feverish and blood is extracted from him in three or four times, then if he is cold-natured, let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in hydromel or in honey-sweetened drink flavored with herbs or in a sweet-smelling rose-scented drink.
If fainting occurs during phlebotomy and its cause is the excessive outflow of blood, then it is necessary that he be given meat broth and a light rose-scented drink; and he should use fragrant galbanum, and rub his chest with it, and use all else that we mentioned in the section on fainting.
which occurs from vomiting. And as for one who wishes to relax his arm and to draw blood a second time, it is necessary for one whose phlebotomy was for copious evacuation and whose strength is weak that the blood be drawn little by little, according to his strength, on consecutive days.
And as for one who wishes to relax his arm and draw blood a second time and his body is strong, let him do that after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy. And as for one who wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite side to which it has inclined, it is necessary to relax him on the second or third day.
And as for one in whose body the blood is much, having become hot and sharp and causing fever, it is necessary that blood be drawn from him at once, and that a large amount be drawn, and that the opening be widened until fainting occurs, after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy. And that you place your hand on his pulse during the flow of blood, lest death occur instead of fainting; for this often happens if the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligence occurs. And it is not necessary, if you wish to relax the arm and draw blood a second time,
if the mouth of the vein has closed and the exit of blood is difficult, that you prick it forcefully or twist it strongly, for that is very bad; rather, either you leave it until you phlebotomize it a second time, or you remove with the blade of the lancet what has solidified of the blood in the mouth of the vein.
Or you apply to it something of salt dissolved in water, or you apply to it something of theriac or xylobalsamum, and prick it gently until the blood comes out; and if the vein has swollen, leave it.
And do not touch it until the swelling subsides; and if necessity demands drawing blood a second time, and there is no alternative, then either you phlebotomize above that place, or you phlebotomize in the other arm or in another vein.
As for phlebotomy of the basilic vein, it is phlebotomized instead of the cephalic and median basilic veins if they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of them.  Its method of phlebotomy is that the patient puts his hand in hot water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears clearly, then it is tied above it with a ligature, slightly and moderately.
Then you phlebotomize the vein slightly obliquely, neither transversely nor longitudinally, and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be slightly above the joint of the hand. If the exit of blood is difficult, return the hand to the vessel of hot water and let the blood flow into the water.
Until it reaches your need. If you are in the summer months, you may dispense with returning the hand to hot water. The practice of letting the blood flow into hot water is most often done in winter.  Phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins. Because there is no underlying vein or nerve. As for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein from the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments.  Its method of phlebotomy is that you tie the wrist with a ligature or with your hand after putting it in hot water until the vein swells.
Because there is no underlying vein or nerve. As for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein from the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments.  Its method of phlebotomy is that you tie the wrist with a ligature or with your hand after putting it in hot water until the vein swells. And it becomes very perceptible to the touch. Then you phlebotomize it slightly obliquely; and even if you cut it completely, that will not harm it at all. Be careful not to push your hand deeply with the lancet, for under it are the nerves of the fingers, and the place is bare of flesh. Then return the hand to the hot water.
And leave it flowing. For if you do not return it to the hot water, the blood will congeal in the opening of the vein and be prevented from flowing. When you have taken out the amount of blood needed, place on the vein fat and salt lest it close up quickly.
And similarly you should do with every narrow branch. As for the benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand, it is beneficial for ailments of the spleen. And you do in its phlebotomy as you did in the second, the same. As for phlebotomy of the saphenous vein, its benefit is for the illnesses which are in the lower part of the body, like ailments of the uterus.
And retention of menses, and kidney diseases, and chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.  Its method of phlebotomy is that he puts his leg in hot water and rubs it until the veins become prominent. Then you tie above the ankle joint with a ligature; and the vein is situated near the heel, on the surface towards the great toe.
And many branches branch off from it on the front of the leg. Therefore phlebotomize in its widest branch, or at the heel where it joins – this is best and safest. For if you phlebotomize it on the front of the leg, be careful of the nerves which are beneath it on the front of the leg.
And make your phlebotomy of it with a twisting motion, as if you wanted to cut it off, and let the lancet be sharp. If the exit of blood is difficult, let him return his leg to the hot water, and leave the blood flowing in it until it is emptied.  If the phlebotomist misses the vein in the first attempt,
let him return with the phlebotomy a little higher. For the place is safe; no harm is feared from it if you are careful of the nerve, as we said. And do the same with the saphenous vein of the other leg. As for the sciatic vein, its place is, as we said, at the heel from the outer side.
And the benefit of its phlebotomy is for hip pain, if that is from hot blood. And its method of phlebotomy is that you put the patient in the bath and hasten, and bind his leg from the hip up to above the heel by four fingers' breadth with a long, thin bandage; for it does not appear except by this means.
Then, when it appears, phlebotomize it in whichever way you prefer: either by twisting – which is best – or by cutting it off, or by splitting it. For its location is safe. And it is extremely hidden in most people. If you do not find it,
and it does not appear at all to the touch, phlebotomize some of its branches, which are those that appear on the dorsum of the foot towards the little finger and the ring finger. And be careful of the nerves, and let out the amount of blood you want.
Then loosen the bandage and place cotton on the site of the phlebotomy and bind the place, for it will quickly heal.
Chapter ninety-six.
Concerning cupping and its method of use.
Cupping vessels may be made of horn, wood, copper, or glass, and cupping is of two types: one is cupping with incision and evacuation of blood, and the other is cupping without incision.
And this cupping without incision is of two types.
And the cupping of the cheeks, which are the sides of the neck on both sides, and the cupping of the chin, which is under the lower jaw, and the cupping of the shoulders, and the cupping of the coccyx at the base of the spine, and the cupping of the forearms, which are the middle of the arms, and the cupping of the legs, and the cupping of the heels.
Cupping draws blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and for that reason it does not weaken the body as much as phlebotomy, and cupping, whether with fire or without, should not be used in any of the diseases that result from plethora until the whole body has been purged.
If the need for cupping arises from illness or habit, we use it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end of the month, in the middle of it, and at any time.
That is because some people, when their blood increases to the point that it needs to be removed by cupping, feel heaviness and headache in their head; and some feel fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck; and some feel itching in their face and sides, darkness and pain in their eyes; and some scratch the place of their cuppings.
And some laugh a lot, and some find the taste of blood in their mouth and their gums bleed and they spit blood, and some sleep a lot, and some see blood, redness, slaughter, and wounds in their sleep and things like that; so when we see any of that...
especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order cupping after two or three hours of the day have passed. As for the benefit of cupping the temples, it benefits from heaviness in the head and water pouring into the eyes.
But it should be after the evacuation of the whole body, and this cupping may be a substitute for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.  It is warned against using it by one who has a cold brain or has a cold, for it greatly harms him.
Therefore, the elderly and those with cold diseases in their heads should not use it, and those who habitually use it will develop forgetfulness.
Therefore, you should instruct the cupper to lower his hand with the cupping glass a little lower, for fear of causing forgetfulness. As for cupping the nape of the neck, it is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilic and cephalic veins.
Therefore, it benefits from asthma, shortness of breath, rupture of the respiratory apparatus, cough, and fullness.  The cupping of the nape of the neck should be raised a little, for if it is lowered, it will cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for cupping the mastoid processes, it benefits from pains occurring in the head, ophthalmia, migraine, angina, and pain at the roots of the teeth.  It is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilic vein. You should instruct the cupper not to deepen his hand with the scarifier, lest he cut a vein and cause bleeding.
As for cupping under the chin, it benefits from thrush in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar diseases in the mouth, and it may take the place of phlebotomy of the veins in the lips. As for cupping the shoulders, it benefits from palpitations that are due to fullness and heat.
As for cupping the forearms, it benefits from what benefits phlebotomy of the three veins—the basilic, cephalic, and median cephalic—because it attracts blood from all those small veins in the flesh and attracts those small veins from other thicker veins until the attraction reaches the three thick veins.
You should instruct the cupper not to be excessive in scarification because the area is devoid of flesh and underneath it are nerves and arteries. As for the single cupping performed on the coccyx, it benefits from hemorrhoids and lower sores.
You should instruct the cupper that the cupping glass should be large and made of copper, because the area requires strong suction and a glass cupping glass might break and require much scarification. As for cupping the legs, it noticeably reduces fullness.
Because it attracts blood from the whole body, it benefits from chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder; it promotes menstruation; it benefits from boils and abscesses; and it takes the place of phlebotomy of the saphenous veins and the veins of the ankles, except that it weakens the body greatly and causes fainting in most people. The benefits of cupping the ankles are similar to the benefits of cupping the legs.
The method of applying cupping glasses is that the cupping glass is first placed empty and suctioned moderately. Do not prolong the placement of the cupping glasses, but rather place them quickly and remove them quickly so that the humors are drawn to the area evenly. Continue to repeat this until you see the area has reddened and opened.
When the redness of blood appears, then scarify and resume suction slowly. Then look at the condition of the bodies. If a person has thin flesh with porous pores, then you should scarify only once, lest the area ulcerate.
Instruct the cupper to widen the scarification and deepen it slightly, and to moderate the suction gently and with a light movement. If the blood is thick, then it should be scarified twice; the first time to open a path for the thin blood and its watery parts, and the second time to completely extract the thick blood.
If the blood is very turbid, then repeat the scarification a third time to achieve the goal. In general, if we want to extract a little blood, we are satisfied with one scarification; if we want to extract a lot of blood, we make more scarifications, especially if we judge the blood to be thick.
It is necessary that we make a deep scarification, and the moderate limit in scarification is only the depth of the skin. What should be used of ointments when applying cupping glasses, and of waters, and what the cupped person should avoid. As for someone whose skin is thick, hard, dry, and whose pores are tight,
then the places of the cupping glasses should be anointed with opening, softening, resolving ointments; if it is in the summer, then for example, with rose oil, or violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil.
And if it is in the winter, then such as narcissus oil, or iris oil, or chamomile oil, or lily oil and the like. If the humor is thick and cold, then let the ointment be marjoram oil, or henbane oil, or butter, or rue oil and the like.
If the cupped person has wide pores and soft flesh, then the ointment should be avoided. These should wash their cupping places after cupping with rose water, or with cold water, or with gooseberry water, or with gourd water, or with chickweed water and the like. As for someone whose blood is very moist,
he should wash his cupping places with vinegar, or with water of asafoetida and sumac and the like. As for someone whose humors are thick, he should wash his cupping places with old wine, or with marjoram water, or a decoction of rue, or chamomile and the like. Cupping should be avoided in the bathhouse and after the bathhouse.
Rather, it should be used after leaving the bathhouse after an hour or two. No one should sleep after cupping.  What the cupped and bled person should manage before and after cupping.
First, it must be looked at; if the cupped or bled person is choleric and sharpness and inflammation prevail in his blood, then he should take refrigerants such as pomegranate, and dandelion with vinegar, and lettuce, and oxymel, and julap and the like, and make his foods from squabs, and lamb meats,  and sorrel and the like.
And if his temperament is cold, then he should be given honeyed drinks and quince drinks or seed oxymel, and he should consume moderately perfumed wine, which is between old and new, and he should be ordered to eat little food, and make his food from squabs, and quails, and sparrows, and young pigeons, spiced.  And the drink on the day of cupping and bleeding should be more than the food.
And it may be necessary to give some people at certain times some of the theriac al-Faruq, or musk medicine, or  silphium before cupping and before bleeding or after it, to strengthen the principal organs and thin the blood, and it should not be given to those who have a fever.
As for cuppings that are without a condition, they are the cuppings that are placed on the liver, and spleen, and breasts, and on the abdomen, and navel, and the place of the kidneys, and the hip joint, because these organs do not tolerate the condition on them; rather what is intended by them is either to draw blood from an organ to another organ.
Such as our placing the cupping glass on the breasts in the illness of epistaxis, or we use it to remove from the organ a cold wind that has settled in the organ, such as our placing the cupping glass on the abdomen and navel, for it loosens the organ and warms it and removes the pain by resolving that wind.
And it may be placed on the kidneys if an obstruction or stone appears in them, then by the force of its drawing it may perhaps open the obstruction or remove the stone from its place, and it does the same if it is placed on the liver and spleen in the case of wind that is disturbed in them, and these cuppings may be used empty with only suction.
And it may be used with fire, and it may be used filled with lukewarm water in cases of inflammation, and that is that the cupping glass is filled, and let it be large, with hot water alone, or with water in which some herbs that are suitable for that have been cooked.
Then it is placed filled on the place and held and removed and repeated many times according to the need, and this is the image of the cupping glass which is used with fire:
Its mouth is two fingers wide, open as we have pictured, and its depth is half a span, and there is in its side, about halfway up, a small hole about the size of a needle's insertion; it is made of Chinese copper or yellow copper, thick-rimmed.
Smooth, even, polished so that it does not harm the member when placed upon it, and in its middle is a transverse bar of copper or iron where the burning candle is placed; and this cupping glass may be made larger than what we have described, and smaller, according to the diseases.
And the way it is used, for the cupping glasses of boys and thin people are not the cupping glasses of men and those of full habit. As for the manner of placing this cupping glass with fire on the member, it is that you prepare a burning wick of tightly-woven flax or a small candle of pitch and place it on the middle of the solidified rod which is in the middle of the cupping glass.
So that the ascent of the fire is upwards towards the bottom of the cupping glass, lest the body of the patient be burned; then it is placed on the member, and the finger on the hole which we mentioned, so that when we have held the cupping glass as long as we need, we remove the finger.
And the vapor goes out through that hole and the cupping glass is loosened from its place; then you prepare the wick in the same way and replace it if you need to do so. As for the cupping glass which is used in the treatment of the disease called *shūshah* with water, it has no solidified rod and no hole.
But it is used by being filled with water and placed on the member only, and this is its form:
And this cupping glass, the larger it is to hold much water, the better it is.
Chapter ninety-seven.
On the suspension of the leech.
Leeches are used mostly in those members where cupping glasses cannot be applied, either because of their smallness, like the lip and gum and the like, or because the member is devoid of flesh, like the finger and nose and the like.
And the method of using them is that you should choose leeches which are in fresh, pure water, free from impurities, then leave them a day and a night in fresh water until they become hungry and nothing remains in their bellies. Then the body is first purged by phlebotomy or cupping, then the affected member is wiped.
Until it reddens, then it is placed upon it; and when it is full, it falls off. And if it is possible to cup the place, this is more effective; otherwise, wash the place with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and rub and squeeze it. If the bleeding continues after the leech falls off, and this is a trickle, then let a linen cloth be wetted in cold water.
And place it on top until the trickle stops. If the blood is profuse, sprinkle upon it powdered vitriol or gallnut or the like of astringents until the bleeding stops, or place on the place halves of peeled lupins.
And leave it until the lupin adheres to the place, for then the blood stops. And it is necessary that if it is needed to reapply leeches, then do not apply those leeches if others are available.  And if the leeches refuse to adhere, then let the place be wiped with fresh blood.
Or a needle is inserted into the place until some blood comes out, then it is applied; for when it senses some blood, it adheres in place. And if you want it to fall off, sprinkle upon it some aloe or salt or ashes; then it falls off in place.
Chapter Three.
On setting (bones).
This chapter also contains what is needed in the craft of medicine, which is the setting of fractures and dislocations occurring in bones.
Know, my sons, that this chapter is claimed by the ignorant among physicians and the common people, and by those who have never consulted a book of the ancients in it, nor read a letter from it.
For this reason, this art of knowledge has become nonexistent in our country, and I have never encountered anyone skilled in it at all. And I only derived what I derived from it through my long reading of the books of the ancients and my eagerness to understand them, until I extracted knowledge of it from them, then I adhered to experience and practice throughout my life.
And I have depicted for you in this chapter all that my knowledge encompassed. And my experience has followed it, after I have brought it close to you and freed it from the branches of prolixity, and shortened it to the utmost brevity, and clarified it to the utmost clarity, and depicted for you in it many images of the instruments that are used in it.
For it is from an increase in explanation, as I did in the preceding two chapters, and there is no strength except in God, the Most High, the Great.
The first chapter.
In it are summaries and compendia concerning the matter of fractured bones, and it is necessary to present them. And before we begin to mention the fractured and dislocated members one by one, it is necessary that we mention at the beginning of this chapter a summary of the discourse and sections. It compels you first to understand them and stand upon their reality, you and whoever else is eager to learn this noble craft.
Then I say that whenever a fracture or dislocation or wound or fall occurs to someone, it is necessary to hasten first to bleed him or purge him, or both. Unless something prevents it, such as weakness of strength, or if the one to whom this has happened is a boy or an old, feeble man, or if the time is extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then restrict his diet to cold vegetables and the meat of birds and gazelles, and forbid him drink and thick meats and overfilling with food, and every food that fills the veins with blood, until the swelling is safe and the pouring of matter to the place is not expected.
Then let the patient return to his first regimen, which was his custom.  When the broken bone begins to knit, then the patient should eat foods that provide abundant, thick, strong nourishment with viscosity, such as porridges, rice, heads, necks, and cow tripe. And eggs and soft fish and thick drinks and the like, for by this method the setting of the fracture will be quicker and better. And know that broken bones, if they are in strong men and old men, cannot ever unite and knit together to their original nature.
Because of the dryness and hardness of their bones.  And what was of bones in the utmost softness, like the bones of small children, may unite and knit together, but nature grows on the broken bone from all its sides something resembling glue, thick, which adheres to it and strengthens it until it binds one part to another.
And it binds one part to another until it comes to the utmost strength and firmness as it was at first, so that nothing hinders him in his actions.
For this reason it is necessary to give the patient food which contains strength, viscosity, and thickness, as we said. And know that fractures differ in type according to the difference of the members, for a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the head bone, and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone.
And so all the other members, each differs from another. And we shall come to mention each type of fracture explained in its chapter in detail apart from the others. And the type of bone fracture may also differ within itself.
For its fracture may be a splintering without splinters occurring in it, and its fracture may be along the length of the bone and its fracture may have splinters and projections, separated or unseparated, and the fracture may be with a wound and rupture in the skin, and the fracture may be a slight crack.
And for each type there is a special method in its setting, as will be mentioned in detail in its place. And among what identifies a bone fracture is its crookedness, swelling, and its appearance to the touch, and its roughness when you probe it with your hand.
Then if there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor roughness, nor do you feel upon touching the bone a disturbance, nor does the patient feel much pain, then there is no fracture, but it may be a sprain or a slight fracture or a slight crack.  Therefore it is not appropriate to move it by pulling and probing at all.
Rather, apply to it from the medications, the mention of which will come after a while, what is suitable for the place, then bind it gently. And know that if the bone is fractured and broken into two without splinters occurring in it, then each part has only moved away from its counterpart.
Then it is necessary for you to hasten at once to straighten and align it before a hot swelling occurs to it.  If a hot swelling occurs to it, then leave it for days until the hot swelling subsides, then align it in whatever way you can, gently and skillfully.
And know that its setting and alignment is easier than a bone in which splinters have occurred. Then it is bound as will be mentioned. If the bone has splinters, then it is necessary to pull the broken limb from both sides, whether it be hand or foot.
Either with your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with a rope and hand.  And let your placement of the limb be on a level surface in its natural form, so that when the broken part of the bone is extended, then return those fragments to their places in whatever way you can, skillfully and gently.
And strive with all your effort that you do not cause the patient pain or suffering by your actions, and strive with all your effort to join one bone to the other in the best manner. It is necessary at that time that you touch and feel them with your hand, and if you see there something amiss, correct and align it to the best of your ability.
And beware of strong pulling and forceful probing, as many ignorant people do, and they often cause by their actions a hot swelling or gangrene in the limb, as I have witnessed many times from their actions.
Then, after the alignment, perfection, and binding, compel that limb to stillness and rest, and warn the patient not to move it during his waking hours and sleep, and during his turning and restlessness, and during his bowel movements and all his movements as much as he is able, and let him strive that the position of the limb is a position which secures him from pain.
That is because, whenever he feels pain or discomfort in the position of the limb, he should move it to another position in which he does not feel pain, while striving to maintain a level and straight position.
Lest deformity occur in the limb if it heals improperly. As for the method of binding the broken limb, it is as I describe to you. Know that broken limbs differ in their smallness and largeness and forms.  Those that are small, such as the arm, finger, forearm, and the like…
it is necessary that the bandages be soft and gentle; and those that are thick, like the thigh, back, and chest, it is necessary that the bandages be broad and firm, for the broad bandage is necessary for a large limb, and it binds it from every side with an equal binding that no defect intervenes.
Then, after you have finished the alignment, you begin to apply the appropriate plaster. with a soft, pliable material over the fracture site. Then begin wrapping the bandage around the fracture itself three or four times, depending on what the limb requires.  Tighten the bandage slightly with your hand, then bring it to the upper part of the fracture site.
with less tightening than you used at the fracture site. Then, gradually move the bandage away from the fracture site, loosening the tension little by little until you have encompassed a suitable portion of the sound area. Then take another bandage and also wrap it around the fracture site.
Then continue the bandage to the lower part of the fracture, and let your action in tightening and loosening the bandage be as we mentioned in the first upper wrapping.  Then place between the bandages some of the soft material or cloths to even out the crookedness of the fracture.
If there is a deformity, otherwise do not put anything there. Then wrap another bandage around it, and then apply firmly fitting splints over these bandages, if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, then apply something to reduce the swelling and eliminate the inflation, and leave it for a few days. Then, at that time, apply splints.  Let the splints be made of broad, carved, skillfully prepared halves of reeds, or let the splints be made of sieve wood.
which are made from pine, or date palm stalks, or  reed, or  boxwood, or similar materials that are available.  Let the width of each splint be of this same size and shape.
Except that the splint which is placed on the fracture itself should be a little thicker and wider than the other splints. As for the length of the splint, it is made according to what suits the broken limb in terms of its size, Image of the splint:
Then tighten the splints with another bandage, in the same way as your first tightening. Then tie it from above with strong threads, according to the tightening we mentioned, which is that your tightening should be stronger at the site of the fracture. And the further it is from the fracture, the less the tightening should be.
The threads should be of medium thickness and fineness, and should be made of wet linen especially, because if the threads are thick, as I have seen done by the ignorant who make their threads from twisted linen strips, this is a great mistake.
Because the tightening with them becomes excessive, and thin threads are also unsuitable because you will not achieve with them the tightening you want.  And there should not be less than a finger's breadth between the splints.
If the patient is harmed by the edges of the splints after tightening in the healthy areas, place soft padding or fluffy wool underneath so that nothing harms him. As for if the fracture is accompanied by a wound and a rupture in the skin occurs, we will mention that separately.
Know that not every broken limb should be bound with splints from the first day.  If the limb is large, splints should not be applied until after five or seven days, or more, depending on your certainty that hot inflammation will not occur.
This is a description of the bandages which the ancients used to bind fractures, dislocations, and sprains.  It is a description of a general, concise bandage that sets fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, because it is not dominated by heat or cold.
It is that you take the dust from the mill, which is the finest flour that adheres to the walls of the mill during the grinding, and knead it as it is, without sifting it, with egg white, making the dough neither thick nor thin, then apply it.
Another bandage which sets fractures, dislocations and sprains: take of mastic, leadwort, acacia,  rasen,  magath, and sugar, ten drachms of each; myrrh and aloes, five drachms of each; of athl, twenty drachms; and of Armenian or Roman clay, twenty drachms. Pound everything together and mix with the water of athl, or with egg white if the patient's temperament is hot. Then use this bandage; for it is well-composed, quickly sets broken bones, and is suitable for most people because of its moderate nature.
Another bandage also useful for fractures and sprains: take magath, mastic, and white leadwort, ten drachms of each; myrrh and aloes, five drachms of each; acacia, six drachms; Armenian clay, twenty drachms. Pound everything finely, sift it, and knead it with water or egg white, and use it.
A bandage for joints and bones that have been dislocated, and which relieves the accompanying pain, and for bone cracks and fractures: take carded wool, soak it in vinegar and cooked oil, and apply it to the affected area. This bandage does not have the power to set [bones].
But it is excellent in relieving hot swelling and particularly in relieving pain. Another bandage which sets broken bones: take the leaves of the deaf fig and the leaves of wild poppy, pound them together, and apply them moist. Another short bandage used when a bone fracture is uniting.
And you want to resolve the remainder of the swelling, take of the root of leadwort, chamomile, violet blossoms, and crushed corn, one part of each. Pound everything, and knead it with white of egg if the limb is not hot; if it is hot, knead it with coriander water or with water, and use it.
Another bandage stronger in resolving than the first, used when a hard swelling occurs as the bone unites: take of the root of leadwort, flaxseed, fenugreek, rosemary, balm mint, violet blossoms, and chamomile, one part of each.
Pound everything and knead it with vinegar, or with fresh water, or with white of egg, all according to the heat of the limb and the state of its inflammation.  As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that it should be placed on the broken limb when setting it.
Except for the cerate made only of wax and oil, and he described it as being of medium consistency between thick and thin. As for Galen, he was of the opinion that things containing dryness with some heat, such as myrrh, aloes, frankincense, and the like that we have mentioned, should be placed on the broken limb when setting it.
Description of a bandage beneficial for weakness and pain: take gallnuts, chickpea flour, human hair that has been plucked or bird feathers, leadwort, and salt, equal parts. Pound, sift, knead and bandage with it. As for the amount of time the bandage should remain...
Then loosen it; that is to say, observe; if no pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone from its place occurs in the diseased area, do not loosen it for many days.  If, however, severe itching, troublesome pain, or swelling occurs in that place…
then hasten to loosen it at once and do not delay at all, and remove the bandage from it. Then take a soft cloth or a damp sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it until the itching and pain subside. Then let the limb rest for an hour.
Then apply carded wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rose oil and bandage it on overnight until you are sure the hot swelling has subsided, the swelling of the limb has ceased, and its pain has gone. Then return to gentle tightening and a light bandage, and do not bind it as tightly as before.
And treat it gently until it heals. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and inflammation, and all the symptoms have completely disappeared and you need a bandage and binding, then reapply it as you did initially. If nothing of what we have mentioned occurs in the limb…
then do not loosen it except after three, four, five, or seven days, or even twenty days; all this depends on what appears to you concerning the condition of the limb, as we said, until the fracture is set and the flesh begins to knit around it.
Then, at that time, increase the binding more than your first binding, and also increase the richness of the patient's diet beyond what was previously mentioned. If you see that the place of the fracture has dried out and become thinner than it should be, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Then bathe it with lukewarm water each time you unbind it, and let this be every three days, and loosen the binding a little. By this action, nourishment will flow to the limb, and it will heal quickly. As for what ignorant bone-setters do, breaking the limb again…
if it was not initially set properly, and it is set crookedly, then this is an error in their action and a great deception. If it were correct, the early authorities would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it, and I have not seen any trace of it from any of them at all. And the correct thing is not to do it.
Chapter Two.
On Fractures Occurring in the Head.
The types of fractures occurring in the head are numerous, their forms varied, and their causes diverse.  Some fractures are caused by a sword blow, and this may either completely sever the bone until it reaches the membrane beneath the bone. Just as an axe does to wood.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called an axe fracture.  Or, the sword may cut some of the bone, severing only its surface, without the cut penetrating completely; this type of fracture is called an absolute extraction. The wound in these two types of fractures may be either large or small.
Some fractures are comminuted or contused, caused by a blow with a stone, or a fall onto a stone or something similar. This fracture may either penetrate, nearly reaching the membrane beneath the bone, or it may be on the surface of the bone.
The wound in these two fractures may also be either large or small.  Some fractures are hidden in the bone, as fine as a hair; this is a slight crack.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called hairline.  Another fracture may result from a fall or a blow from a stone or the like, which drives a piece of the bone inwards, causing a depression at the site, similar to what happens to a copper pot when struck, causing a portion of it to be driven inwards.
This most often occurs in the soft bones of the head, such as in the heads of children. All these types of fractures may have loose and non-loose fragments. We shall describe the treatment of all of these in their proper place, and we shall identify all these types of fractures by examining them.
and examining them with probes and removing the corrupted flesh from them. As for the hairline type, it is identified by examining the bone, wiping it, and staining it with ink; the fracture will appear black. As for the treatment of fractures, one must first look at the patient's symptoms.
If you see symptoms that clearly indicate danger, such as vomiting bile, prostration, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, sunken eyes, redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms, do not approach the patient or treat him, for death is inevitable in most cases with these symptoms.
But if you see symptoms that do not alarm you and you hope for his recovery, then begin his treatment.  If the injured person comes to you immediately after the injury, and this is during the winter months,
you should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, in any case.  If it is during the summer months, you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane under the bone spoils and those symptoms we described appear.
If the fracture of the bone has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is crushing and contusion, you should cut away the crushed and contused part as I describe to you: shave the head of the injured patient.
Expose the bone in whatever way is possible for you, according to the shape of the wound and what is easiest for the patient. If, upon exposing the bone, you find bleeding or a hot swelling, treat it as necessary.
This is done by packing the area with cloths soaked in a potion and rose oil, and cleaning the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding stops. Then begin to bore out and remove the bone; this can be done in one of two ways.
The first method is to cut the bone with a fine saw with a narrow blade.  Here is its image:
Then use another saw, slightly wider than the first. Here is its image:
Then also use another saw, wider still than the second.  It is necessary that you have a set of saws of varying widths and lengths, all extremely sharp. Let them be made of Indian steel or good quality iron.
And use gentleness in applying the saw, lest you shake the head and injure it. If the bone is strong and solid, it is necessary to bore around it before using the saws, with the borers called non-immersive borers.  They are called non-immersive borers.
Because they do not penetrate beyond the skull bone, for the borer has a round edge below its sharp head, similar to a small ring or circle, preventing it from penetrating and going beyond the thickness of the bone.
You should have many of these borers, each suitable for a particular bone thickness, so that for each skull you have a borer whose sharp point is of appropriate length and shortness for the thickness of that skull. Here is an image of three types. of the borers: large, medium, and small.
As for the method of boring around the fractured bone, you place the borer on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated. Then you move the borer to another location, making the distance between each hole about the thickness of an awl or similar.
Then cut between each two holes with the cutting instruments, doing so with the utmost gentleness as we have said, until you remove the bone either with your hand or with some other instrument prepared for this purpose.
such as forceps and delicate hooks. You should be very careful that the borer or cutter does not touch any of the peritoneum.  If you have removed the bone and it is clear of the peritoneum, if it was adhering to it, and you have removed it, then you should dress the wound.
And smooth the roughness of what remains of the bone with another instrument similar to the cutter, except that it should be thinner and more delicate than the other cutters. If any small bones or fragments remain, remove them gently with the instruments you have.
Then treat the wound afterwards with sutures and ointments, which will be mentioned later. As for the other method, it is very easy and free from danger; Galen mentioned it and praised it highly.  His words are: First, you should begin by uncovering the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and obvious, until, when you have uncovered that part, you place the tip of this lenticular cutter underneath it; and this is its image:
Its lenticular part should be smooth so that it does not cut anything, and its sharp part should be on its sides extending lengthwise, as you see, so that the lenticular part rests against the peritoneum and the sharp edge of the cutter is against the bone. Then strike the cutter from one side.
With a small mallet, until you cut through all the bone gently as it rotates, and you are safe from the membrane, so that nothing frightening happens to it at all, even if the surgeon is the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he were sleepy.
If any part of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some parts of the bone, then scrape it off with the tip of the lenticular cutter itself, and gently free it from it; for it will be freed from it without harm or fear.
But if the bone fracture has not penetrated to the membrane, and what was broken off from the bone was its surface, and roughness and small fragments remain in it, then you should remove that roughness and extract those fragments with fine forceps, several of which have been made in different sizes, so that you can use the most suitable and best of them in each place, according to what the work leads you to.
And the broken bone itself and its shape, and you should use the widest of those forceps first to remove the bone, then use a finer one after it, and continue to do that successively until you come to using the finest and thinnest of them all.
As for the other small, hair-like cracks and slight fractures, you should use for each one a treatment according to what leads to its healing; this is something which is not hidden from anyone who has the slightest experience in this craft and has understood what we have written and explained concerning large fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when you extract the bone, then you should take a linen cloth of the size of the wound and dip it in rose oil and place it on the mouth of the wound, then take another folded or triangular cloth. And dip it in syrup and rose oil and place it on the first cloth, and do this as gently as you can so as not to weigh down the peritoneum, then use a wide bandage on top and do not tighten it except to the extent that it only holds the wound.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are safe from the hot swelling, then untie it and use afterwards those medicines which have a drying effect, such as the roots of iris, crushed costus, crushed spikenard, zedoary, and the like. This is done by making a powder from these medicines.
And sprinkle it on the wound dry. In short, use a medicine which cleanses and does not sting. In your treatment of the wound, strive to keep it clean, free from fat and dirt, and do not allow pus to collect in it at all.
Because if pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts and putrefies it, causing great harm to the patient.  This can occur in the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if its treatment is neglected.
If blackness appears on its surface, and the patient exhibits the symptoms we have mentioned, know that he will inevitably perish.  However, if the blackness resulted from a medicine applied to it, and it was in the nature of that medicine to cause such blackness,
you should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, mix them well, and apply them to a cloth, which you then place on the peritoneum. Then treat it with the various appropriate treatments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On the reduction of a fractured nose.
Know that only the upper parts of the nose, both or one, can be fractured, because these are bones; the lower part is cartilaginous and does not fracture, but rather is subject to bruising, crookedness, and flattening.
If one of its sides is fractured, you should insert your little finger into the nostril and, using your index finger and thumb externally, straighten the fracture from the inside until you restore the nose to its natural shape.  Do this gently, being careful not to cause the patient pain.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, it should be straightened with the end of a slightly thick probe. If the fracture is on both sides, do the same.  And let it be set on the first day of the fracture.
If possible, otherwise after seven or ten days, when the acute inflammation has subsided. Then insert a pledget of linen into the nostril if the fracture is on one side, or two pledgets if it is on both sides.
Let the pledgets be thick enough to fill the nostril. Some early bone-setters mentioned moistening the pledgets with fat and changing them daily, but I do not consider that necessary; rather, the pledgets should be moistened with egg white mixed with finely ground flour.
Then leave the pledgets in place until the bone is set and the cartilage hardens.  Goose quills, wrapped in soft linen, may be inserted into the nose at the site of the pledgets, to provide firmer support for the fractured nose and to prevent the patient from being unable to breathe.
This is not necessary; you may do it or you may use pledgets instead. If acute inflammation occurs in the nose during treatment, apply a compress of quince or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or some diachylon ointment.
If no acute inflammation occurs, apply an external dressing of finely ground semolina and frankincense mixed with egg white, then apply a soft bandage, but do not tie the nose at all, if the nasal bones are only slightly fractured.
Or if they are shattered, incise them and remove the fragments with a suitable instrument, then suture the incision and treat it with appropriate ointments that promote healing. If a wound occurs inside the nose, treat it with pledgets and use lead tubes. until it heals.
Chapter Four.
On the setting of lower jaw fractures.
If the lower jaw is fractured without an accompanying wound, and the fracture is external only, without being broken in two and depressed inwards, then its detection is easy.
If the fracture is in the right ramus, you should insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is in the left ramus, insert the index finger of the right hand, and gently elevate the fractured portion from the inside outwards.
With your other hand outside the bone, you should manipulate it to set it. If the jaw is fractured in two, then traction should be applied from both sides until alignment is achieved. If the teeth are involved, they will be loosened.
Or if they are separated, then tie those you hope will remain with a gold, silver, or silk thread. Then apply pledgets to the fractured jaw, and over that a folded cloth, and over the cloth a firm, large splint or a piece of sole leather equal to the length of the jaw. Then bind it from above according to what seems best to you and suits the binding, so that it does not become undone. Instruct the patient to remain still and calm, and give him soft drinks as food. If you think that something has changed in its appearance in any way, then proceed to unbind it on the third day.
Then bind it from above according to what seems best to you and suits the binding, so that it does not become undone. Instruct the patient to remain still and calm, and give him soft drinks as food. If you think that something has changed in its appearance in any way, then proceed to unbind it on the third day. Then repair the bandage with mill dust mixed with egg white or semolina flour after removing the pledgets, and place a soft compress over the bandage. As long as the bandage adheres and the condition of the bone does not change, leave it.
Do not unbind it until it heals and the fracture is firm. Often this fracture becomes firm in three weeks. If a hot inflammation occurs during that time, then use what we have repeatedly mentioned to soothe it until the inflammation subsides.
But if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, look; if a splinter or splinters have separated from the bone, gently remove those splinters with whatever instrument is suitable for their removal. If the mouth of the wound is narrow, widen it with the scalpel as much as you need.
Then, when you have removed those splinters and nothing remains, stitch the wound if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the ointments suitable for that purpose. And suture the wound until it heals.
Chapter Five.
On the reduction of the clavicle if it is fractured.
The clavicle is most often fractured in front, at the end of the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways: either it is broken and split into two without splinters, which is easiest to reduce;
or splinters occur in the fracture, which is more difficult to reduce; or the fracture is accompanied by a wound.  The procedure, if the fracture is without a wound, is that you should have two assistants, one to hold the arm adjacent to the fractured clavicle, and the other to extend the neck towards the other side.
Then you should set the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be, and there is neither projection nor irregularity. If you need more extension, you should place under the armpit of the patient a ball of rags or wool.
Its size should be according to your need. You extend and raise the clavicle and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is set as it should be. If you are unable to pull the end of the clavicle outwards because it has gone inwards, then the patient should lie on his back.
A moderately sized pillow is placed under his shoulder, and the assistant presses his shoulder downwards until the clavicle that is deep rises upwards. Then set the fracture and align it with your fingers.
If you feel that a splinter of the clavicle has broken and is moving, you should incise over it and remove that splinter gently. If the splinter is embedded in the bone, try to cut it with one of the instruments prepared for that purpose. After placing under the clavicle the instrument that protects the peritoneum, which is an instrument of wood or iron, and this is its image:
It resembles a spoon without a curve.  Its width should be according to the size of the bone, large or small, and its length also according to what you can manage for the work, and let it be double-ended as you see, one end wider and the other narrower.
If the wound opening that you incised when removing the bone splinter is wide and you are safe from hot inflammation, join the edges of the wound by stitching. If the opening is small or you fear hot inflammation, cauterize the wound with a cautery and lint according to the size of the incision.
If hot inflammation appears, wet the cautery in rose oil and vinegar or wine and apply it. As for setting a bone if it is without a wound or incision, it is that you apply to the bone a compress made of mill dust with egg white. And you place the soft splint on it, then you place the ball under his armpit if he needs it, then you take a bandage that is very long, and its width is a cubit or so, then apply a folded compress to the splint and the compress, then take a splint from a thin board. Let its width be three fingers and in length likewise, then insert it into a cloth, then insert that cloth with the splint into the place of the bandage which falls on the place of the fracture, then tighten the bandage on the fracture as it turns. And pass it over his neck and under his sound armpit and under his injured armpit and return it several times on each side, and as you see that the tightening controls the fracture firmly, which is not hidden from you.
And the aim of all this is that the splint does not move from the broken bone. Therefore, you should check on the patient every day; whenever the bandage loosens and you see that the splint has moved, correct that and tighten the bandage.  Then let the patient sleep on his back and place a small pillow under his armpit when he sleeps at night.
So that his arm is raised from his side, and the clavicle fracture is raised by raising the shoulder, or tie his arm to his neck.  And do not untie the bandage unless something happens at the site, such as itching or swelling, until twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see a reason for it. Then leave it bandaged until the clavicle fracture heals and consolidates, and it strengthens and becomes firmer; this takes about twenty-eight days. And in some people it may be less than that.
Chapter Six.
On the setting of a fractured humerus.  The humerus rarely fractures in its wide part; rather, it fractures at its extremities.  When a part of it is fractured, or it is fractured in the middle, this is known by touch.  Then, according to the nature of the fracture, treat it.
Straighten it and restore it to its natural shape by any means you can, then apply to the area mill dust with egg white and soft lint; place on top a pad of folded cloth, and then apply a broad splint of wood.
Thin enough to cover the whole shoulder or slightly wider. If, under the splint, there is any unevenness in any part of the shoulder, smooth out that unevenness with soft lint until the splint lies evenly, then bind tightly from above with a long bandage.
Bind it firmly and make sure the splint does not move from its place. Check the bandage every day; whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it moves from its place. Let the patient lie on his sound side. The shoulder heals in twenty [days].
days or twenty-five days. When this period is complete, remove the bandage, and you are safe, for it is among the bones which are not to be feared for shattering or breaking. If a fragment of bone protrudes and is pressing under the skin, incise over it and remove it. And do what was mentioned in the fracture of the clavicle to alleviate the hot swelling if anything of that occurs.
Chapter Seven.
On the setting of a fracture of the chest.
The chest may be fractured in its middle, though this rarely happens; as for its extremities, they are more frequently fractured and shattered. Among its symptoms, if its middle is fractured, is that it inclines downwards, and there is intense pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing.
And perhaps blood is expelled, and the depression in the fractured bone becomes apparent and is not hidden from the touch.  Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back, a pillow is placed between his shoulders, then his shoulders are compressed, and the ribs are brought together with the hands from both sides, and gentleness is used in straightening it in every way possible.
And continue until the shape of the bone is restored as it should be, then apply a bandage and a splint, and place on top of it a splint of thin wood from willow or elm or something similar that is light, after wrapping it in a cloth. Then gently tie it to the fractured bone lest it shift, and pass the bandage around to the back several times, and tighten it firmly, then check the bandage frequently, and whenever it loosens, tighten it.
And if necessity dictates its removal due to suppuration occurring at the site, or pain, or swelling, then hasten to remove it, and take off the bandage, and treat whatever has occurred in accordance with its treatment, then reapply the bandage if you see fit. And treat it in this manner, and keep it firmly bound until it heals.
Chapter Eight.
Concerning the setting of broken ribs. Know that fractures of the ribs occur in the thick parts adjacent to the back, and their extremities in front are only subject to contusion, because they are cartilaginous, and the knowledge of this is not hidden from the sense upon examination with the fingers.
And its treatment is to set the fracture with the fingers in the accessible way, until the shape is made even as it should be, then it is bandaged, and the broken bone is bound with a splint if it needs it.  If the fracture of the ribs is inclined inwards, then severe pain affects the patient.
And it penetrates like the penetration which occurs to one who has a chest wound, because the bone penetrates the diaphragm, and there also occurs for him difficulty of breathing, coughing, and the expectoration of much blood. This is difficult to treat, and the ancients devised many stratagems for it.
And some of them said that it is necessary to give the patient foods that produce flatulence and wind, so that the abdomen swells and expands and the fracture is pushed outwards. And we dislike this, lest it should confirm the occurrence of hot inflammation if it has not occurred; and if it has occurred, then it increases it and confirms it.
And some of them said that a cupping glass should be placed on the place, then sucked strongly; and this is more like the proper method, except that it is feared that the cupping glass will draw humors to the place on account of its weakness. And some of them said that it is necessary to cover the place with wool which has been dipped in hot oil.
And a bandage is made between the ribs until it is full, so that the binding is even when it is wound around circularly. Then the patient is treated with the treatment of a chest wound, in terms of food and medicine; if the patient is afflicted by a severe matter which he cannot bear. And the bone penetrated the diaphragm in a harmful way, and we feared for the patient; therefore it is necessary to incise the place and uncover the broken rib, then place under it the instrument which preserves the peritoneum, which has been described previously, and gently break the bone and extract it.
Then we bring together the edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures, and treat it with ointments until it heals. If a hot inflammation occurs during this time, then act quickly, wet bandages in rose oil, place them on the place, and treat the patient with what calms the inflammation from within also.
And he lies on the side on which sleep is easiest for him until he heals.
Chapter Nine.
On the setting of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
As for the bones of the neck, if a fracture affects them—and this rarely happens to them, and contusions are more common to them, as well as to the vertebrae of the back also—then if this happens to someone and you want to know whether he will heal or not heal, look: then if you see his hands have become relaxed, numb, and dead, and he is not able to move them, nor extend them, nor contract them, and if you pinch them or prick them with a needle he does not feel it and finds no pain in them, then know that in most instances he will not heal, and he is dying.
And if he moves them and feels the pinching and pricking in them, then know that the marrow of the bone has been saved and that the patient will heal with treatment.  If the vertebrae of the back are similarly affected and you want to know whether he will heal or not,
look at his legs: then if you see that they have become relaxed and what happened in the hands has happened in them, then if he lies on his back, wind and faeces come out involuntarily, and if he lies on his stomach, urine comes out involuntarily, and if he lies on his back and wants to urinate, he is unable to do so, then know that he is dying, so do not trouble yourself with his treatment. If none of this happens to him, the matter is less serious. The treatment of what has happened is that you try to alleviate the hot swelling.
by placing on the injured vertebra rose oil alone, or with roasted egg yolks; apply this three times a day until the hot swelling subsides. Then apply to the place one of the strengthening, drying compresses and bind it tightly, and instruct him to remain still and quiet.
And let him not sleep except on the side where he feels no pain, until he is healed. If, at the time of the injury, a splinter or something has become detached from the bone, then it is necessary to incise the skin and remove that bone. Then bring together the edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures, then treat with healing ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the coccyx, which is the tailbone, is broken, then you should insert the thumb of the left hand into the rectum.
and set the broken bone with the other hand, as best you can manage and achieve the setting. Then apply the compress and splint, if you need to, and then bind it.
If you feel a broken splinter in it, then incise it and remove it, and treat the wound with the treatment mentioned above until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the reduction of a fracture of the hip.
Hip bones rarely fracture; but if they do fracture, it is only in that their extremities are shattered and they split lengthwise, and incline inwards.  The patient experiences pain in the area, and numbness and tingling in the leg on the side of the fracture.
Its reduction is that you pass your hand over it until you ascertain the nature of the fracture. If the fracture is only in its extremities, then set that fracture according to what seems best to you in setting it, until its shape resembles its natural form.
If the fracture is lengthwise, or if it has inclined inwards, lay the patient on his stomach so that the reduction of that fracture is made easier for you.  When you have set it, apply a bandage, then put a splint of wood or leather on it and bind it tightly.
Do not fear for him the displacement of the fracture or the loosening of the splint, and fill the hollow of the hips with what will fill it, until the binding is even. And instruct the patient to lie on his back or on his sound side. If a hot inflammation should occur to him,
desist from its reduction until the hot inflammation subsides, and apply what will alleviate it as previously described. Then return to its reduction and binding as is appropriate. If splinters or shattered fragments of bone appear, they should not be removed.
They are not to be touched, but are to be set from the outside as we have said, and its binding is to be left until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the reduction of a fracture of the humerus.
The humerus is that which is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder. If it is fractured, its reduction is done in one of two ways. One is to take a smooth, curved piece of wood of medium thickness, in this manner:.
And you tie two bandages to its ends, then it is hung from a high place, and the patient sits on a chair, then his broken arm is placed on the wood until his armpit is fixed in the middle of the curve of the wood, then something heavy is hung from above it.
Or a servant stretches it downwards, then the physician sets the fracture with his hands together until he reduces the fracture as it should be. The other method is that the patient lies on his back and his hand is suspended from his neck with a bandage.
Then you order two servants, one to hold above the fracture with his hands and the other to hold below it, and each stretches to his side. And if you want the traction to be stronger, then tighten below the fracture with a bandage and above it with a bandage, and each of the servants stretches to his side.
If the fracture is near the shoulder joint, then the middle of the bandage should be under the armpit and the other under the fracture towards the elbow.  Likewise, if the fracture is near the elbow, then the bandage should be in that place and on the elbow itself.
Then you set the fracture gently without force until the fracture is set as it should be and unites well. Then you bandage it if no hot swelling appears. If hot swelling appears, leave bandaging until the seventh day and apply moistened wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil.
Until the swelling subsides, then bandage it. The method of bandaging is to apply the compress to the fracture, then apply a bandage of new cloth over the compress, then bring the arm to the upper arm itself and place the hand open on the shoulder.
And you apply the cloth and bandage to the upper arm and forearm so that the forearm acts as a splint, if nothing prevents you from doing so and nothing changes in the broken bone. If you fear that something might change, then use splints.
This is to place on the fracture itself a splint that is wider and stronger than the other splints, and let there be the width of a finger between each splint.  Let the length of the splints be according to the fracture, with the addition of three fingers on each side.
Then you tighten the splints with the tightening that I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And that your tightening on the place of the fracture should be tighter.
And the further from the fracture, the less the tightening. If you see that the placing of the splints and the tightening as we said at the time of your setting the limb is suitable, then do so.
And if you fear a hot inflammation, leave off the tightening and the splints until the seventh day, as we said. Then examine the bandage every three days, lest there occur in the place chafing or swelling, or the nourishment be prevented from reaching the member by reason of excessive tightening.  Correct all this as we mentioned.
But if you are confident that nothing of that sort will happen, do not loosen the bandage except after many days. And let the patient lie on his back with his hand on his stomach, and a pillow filled with wool and of moderate size be placed under the armpit.
And examine at every time, night or day, lest the shape of the broken member be disarranged or the bandage become loose. Then correct all this with your effort, and let the patient's diet be of the kind we have already mentioned: that the food should be light at first until the bone is about to become firm.
Then it is proper to make his food more substantial. For it is the habit of the arm and leg to become firm in forty days. Then it is proper to loosen [the bandages], and he should use the bath and be treated with the ointments which are suitable for this.  If the fracture is extensive and comminuted,
then do not loosen the bandage from him until fifty days or until two months.
Chapter Twelve.
On the setting of a fracture of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the ulna; one is small, and it is that which is next to the thumb; and the other is large, and it is situated under the small one from below.  Therefore, perhaps the larger ulna is broken alone, or the smaller one alone, and perhaps both are broken together.
And when the smaller upper ulna is broken, then its setting is easy and its healing is quicker. And when the lower ulna is broken, then its fracture is bad and its healing difficult. And the worst of them is if the two bones are broken together.  If the bone which is broken is the smaller upper ulna,
then it is necessary for the physician, when setting it, to make its extension easy gently until he straightens it.  And if the large ulna is that which is broken, then it is necessary to make its extension stronger. And if both ulnas are broken, then it is necessary to make the extension much stronger.
And it is necessary that the shape of the hand, when it is set and extended, be extended on a cushion, and the thumb of the hand should be above, higher than all the fingers, and the little finger should be lower than the other fingers, and the patient should sit squarely on himself.
And let the cushion be opposite him in height, lest the patient suffer hardship.
Then a servant extends the arm from below, either with his hand or with a bandage, and another servant extends from above likewise. Then the physician straightens the bone until he returns it to the best shape he can. And if there are fragments in the fracture of the bone, then they are removed.
Return each fragment to its place to the best of your ability.  If a fragment appears that is detached and is piercing the skin and there is no hope of setting it, then incise it and extract it in the manner which we mentioned previously.  If the fracture is with a wound, then I have dedicated a chapter to it.
Then take the treatment of that from there. If a hot swelling appears at the beginning of your setting, then apply a cloth with prepared Kypros, rose oil, and white wax. Let it be moderate between thickness and thinness, and bind the cloth on it gently until the swelling subsides.
Then remove the Kypros and apply the prepared bandage of mill dust with egg white. Then apply the splints; and let the splint that is placed on the fracture itself be somewhat wider and stronger. And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most cases.
Whether the fracture was in one forearm bone or in both forearm bones together, then make your binding at the location of the fracture stronger and tighter. And whenever you turn the binding upwards or downwards, make the binding a little looser as mentioned previously at the beginning of the chapter.
And let the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture be soft and moist, and not very hard. And let the thread with which it is bound be of special linen, moderate between thinness and thickness, as we described. And examine the limb and bandage after a few days.
If something happens that needs to be corrected, such as itching that appears in the limb, then it is necessary to wash the limb with warm water until that itching subsides, and leave the limb unbound for a night so that it may rest, then resume the binding.
If the binding has loosened and the bone has shifted or something like that, then correct all of that to the best of your ability. And also look, if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive binding, then it is necessary to loosen it a little and leave it for a few days until nourishment flows to it, then bind it.
If nothing of what we have mentioned occurs to the patient, then it should not be unbound except after twenty days or so. Then, suspend the patient's hand to his neck, and let his arm be straight. And he should carefully avoid agitated movements, and let his sleep be on his back.
And know that this fracture of the arm heals in thirty days, or in thirty-two, and perhaps it heals in twenty-eight days; all that according to the states of the temperaments and the states of strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the setting of a fracture of the hand and fingers.
Fracture rarely occurs in the metacarpus and phalanges of the fingers; rather, contusion frequently occurs to them.  So when a fracture or contusion occurs to the hand…
The patient should sit cross-legged, with a chair directly in front of him, level.
Then he should place his hand upon it, extended. Then the surgeon should extend the broken bones and set them, until they are well-set.  Then a bandage and splint should be applied, if no hot inflammation occurs. Then a splint should be applied over that, according to the location.
And it is inserted into a soft cloth. If the fracture is towards the lower part, towards the palm of the hand, then make a kind of sphere from cloth and instruct the patient to grasp it with his broken hand, then tighten it with a long cloth.
And let the splint be of soft leather, so that it conforms to the skin with the bending of the whole hand, and tighten it as necessary. If the fracture is outwards, then the splint should be placed above and another splint below in the hand, so that the hand is open and upright.
Then the bandage is applied as the hand rotates, and interlaces between the fingers with the bandage. If the fracture affects one of the finger joints, if it is the thumb, let it be set properly, then bandaged with the hand; and if you wish, you can make a small, upright splint to support the fracture.
And it should not move. If the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle, index, little, or ring finger, let them be set and bound with the healthy adjacent finger, or all bound together, which is better, or a small upright splint is placed on them.
As we said concerning the thumb, and examine during and after your setting for hot inflammation, and counteract it as necessary whenever anything of that occurs, as has been repeatedly described.
Chapter Fourteen.
On the setting of a fractured thigh.
The thigh bone is frequently fractured and is evident to the touch because it moves forward and backward.  Its treatment is to fasten a bandage above the fracture and another below it, the patient lying on his face.
Then each bandage is extended to its side moderately. This is if the fracture is in the middle of the bone, but if it is near the head of the thigh, then a soft bandage should be applied, either of wool or similar material.
At the head of the thigh towards the groin so that the extension is upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.  Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, let the bandage be near the knee so that the extension is downwards. Then the physician straightens the bone with both his hands until he restores it to its natural form.
And the bone unites well. Then the bandage and binding should be maintained, unless a hot inflammation occurs in the limb. If inflammation occurs, leave it for a few days until the hot inflammation subsides, then return to its treatment.
As for binding it, a wide, firm turban should be wound twice or thrice around the fracture, leaving some excess. Then the leg is bent until the heel is at the base of the buttock, and a long thread is inserted between the thigh and leg near the knee from below, and the ends of the thread are brought up from both sides.
Then the remaining part of the turban is wound around the leg and thigh. Then splints are placed on the thigh at the site of the fracture itself, and one splint is placed on the bone of the leg. Then fill the space between the thigh and leg with soft cloths so that the binding is even.
Then begin strong binding from the middle at the site of the fracture, three or four turns.  The farther the bandage is from the site of the fracture, the less tight and softer the binding should be.
Then take the ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and leg, and tie with it the splints above. Then pass the ends of the thread down to the heel of the foot and also tie the ends of the splints on the other side with them.
So that the bandage does not move from its place. Then leave the binding in place as long as no pain, swelling, or puffiness, etc., occurs in the limb. If any of this occurs, quickly unbind it and correct whatever has happened, as we have repeatedly mentioned.
If there is a penetrating splinter in the bone, it should be straightened if possible. Otherwise, make an incision over it and remove it, and treat the wound as previously described until it heals. This fracture of the thigh may be bound without the leg being included with the splints.
As we mentioned in the case of the humerus and forearm, except that setting it like this does not result in lameness for the patient. But if it is set alone without the leg being included, the patient will necessarily always limp.
Know that the thigh heals in fifty days, or a little more or less, all this depending on the differences in temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the fracture of the kneecap.
Fracture of the kneecap rarely occurs, but it is often contused. If a fracture does occur, it is either a fissure or a shattering into fragments, and this may be with or without a wound.
You will ascertain all this by touch, and you will set it by straightening the separated fragments with your fingers until they are united and joined together, according to the degree of accuracy, gentleness, and skill you can achieve; then apply a bandage, and apply a circular splint if necessary.
And tighten the bandage appropriately, then treat all the conditions we have described in other fractures, such as acute inflammation, etc., by counteracting each symptom with the appropriate treatment, until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the setting of fractures of the leg.
The leg has two bones; one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the fibula.  They are subject to the same types of fractures as the bones of the arm. Therefore, its treatment is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is identical. If both bones are fractured, the leg is displaced in all directions; if the thinner bone is fractured, the leg is displaced forward; and if the thicker bone is fractured lower down, this is something which is not hidden from you.
Therefore, use extension and reduction, and apply splints accordingly, except that if the fracture of the leg is a severe one with many fragments, the extension should be less and gentler, and you should take great care in its treatment.
And in the case of the leg there is something additional to the treatment of the arm: when you have set the splints and completed all your work, take two thin strips of pine wood, the kind used for smoothing rooms, which are placed between the cracks in the planks, or make them from palm leaves or something similar.
Choose those of moderate thickness, not too thin, and let their length be equal to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.  Then wrap each one with a cloth in two turns along its length, and place one on one side of the leg and the other on the other side.
Let them extend from the knee to the lower part of the foot, then bind the two thin strips in three places, at the ends and in the middle. With this binding, the leg is prevented from tilting to the right or left, and is well supported.  A wooden gutter along the length of the leg may also be used.
It is placed in it to keep it from moving, and this is most necessary to do in a fracture if there is a wound associated with it. Then examine the leg every day and attend to it with great care regarding swelling, inflammation or anything else. If anything of that sort occurs, counter it appropriately until it heals. The bone of the leg knits together in about thirty days or so.
Chapter Seventeen.
On the fracture of the bones of the leg and the fingers.
As for the heel, fracture never occurs in it at all. As for the bones of the leg, fracture may occur in them, and also the fingers; however, fracture rarely occurs in them, but rather contusion in most instances.
If a fracture occurs in the bones of the leg and you see that some of those bones are prominent over others, then let the patient put his foot on the ground upright as when walking, then you stand and place your foot on what is prominent of those bones, then tread and level them.
until they return to their places, then apply a bandage and splint from above, and place a small board with two flat ends under the sole of the foot, then bind the foot tightly after wrapping it with cloths and everything else that it needs.
Then, if three or four days pass, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones straight, whether they were fractured or dislocated; the procedure is as you see.  As for if some of the fingers are fractured, set them and straighten them according to what I described to you in the setting of the fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the fractured finger along the length of the finger, and let it be slightly wider than it, then place under the foot this board which I described to you and bind it tightly. If what is fractured of the bones is two or three or more,
then make for each finger a splint of its size, layered in a soft cloth, and tighten the board at the bottom of the foot, and let each end of the board rest outside the sole of the foot to secure it well.
And you should not forget to attend to all that we mentioned to you in other fractures from the symptoms that we mentioned, and treat each symptom as it should be.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the fracture of the woman's pubis and the man's penis.
When a woman's vulva is fractured, seat her cross-legged, then bend her slightly backward little by little, and let her be held from behind, then let the midwife pack her vulva with cotton until it fills it and becomes like a ball in her vulva.
Then the woman is shaken and her loins are raised little by little, for that cotton will come out until it is at the opening of the vulva like a ball, and the fracture of the bone will return. Then a pad is placed on her back, and when she wants to urinate, the cotton is removed gently so that she can urinate.
And return it in the way it was first introduced, then she returns to her first pad. She does this for seven days or so, for it will heal. And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, tie a tube to its mouth, and insert the entire bladder into her vulva.
Then blow forcefully into the tube until the bladder inflates inside the vulva, for the fracture will return. Then pack it with cotton and remain as we described until it heals. As for when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, it is treated in the same manner.
And its treatment is as we described for the hip bone.  The correct treatment of these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, especially for those with some experience and who understand this book well, is not hidden from you, for the fracture itself indicates the treatment in most cases.
Understand the correct way to treat and bind it. As for the penis, if it is fractured, take a goose's gullet, insert the penis into it, then apply a bandage of cloth, bind it, and leave it for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen.
On the treatment of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
Whoever suffers a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the thigh bone or humerus or similar, should immediately be bled if the conditions for bloodletting, as we have previously mentioned, are favorable.
If the wound bleeds, you should immediately stop it by applying powdered vitriol if nothing else is available. Then treat the fracture that same day, do not delay.
If no hot swelling occurs, then leave it until the ninth day if a hot swelling does occur, until the hot swelling subsides.  Do not attempt it at all on the third or fourth day, for bad symptoms may result.
If the broken bone is protruding through the skin and exposed, you should gently try to reposition and straighten it with your hands and a slight pull. If you cannot reposition and straighten it with your hands, reposition it with this instrument, which is made of iron and is about seven or eight fingers long. And its width should be according to the wound.
Therefore, the physician should have three or four of them, according to what he needs for treatment in each type of fracture. Let them be round, with a little thickness, so that they do not bend when pressure is applied during use.
And let the end be sharp, with a curve at its tip. Let the upper part be thicker, and from its middle to the lower part, much thinner.  This is its form:
It is called in Greek *peron*, meaning a small lever.  The sharp, curved end should be placed on the end of the protruding bone and pushed with it gently, until the bone returns and becomes somewhat straight, then align the broken ends with each other.
If the broken end is thin and the instrument does not grip it well, then it is necessary to cut the end of that bone until the instrument can grasp it. If you are not able to reset the bone as we have described, then cut it with a similar cut to those we mentioned.
Or spread it with one of the saws, however you can. Then remove any remaining roughness and thin scales from the bone. If, after resetting it, the patient feels severe, painful throbbing, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you are able to return it to its natural position, do so, for you will greatly benefit the patient. When you have finished setting the bone, dip a cloth in a black astringent drink, especially if it is summer, and do not apply a poultice or anything greasy to the wound.
Lest putrefaction and corruption occur. Then, when you have finished setting the bone, apply the splints and leave the wound exposed by cutting a hole in the bandages with scissors, the size of the wound.
Take great care not to bind the wound tightly with the fracture, for many ignorant physicians have done this, causing their patients either death, gangrene, or tetanus. Let your binding be gentle, loose, and unlike the binding of other fractures.
If the wound is bad, or is a large wound, and you fear some of the bad symptoms we have described, and he feels troubling pain in the place, then you should not apply splints, but make bandages of firm cloths in place of the splints, and bind it with them.
If after a day or two you see that pus is beginning to form in the wound, remove the cloth that you applied with the astringent drink, then use lint and ointments that we customarily use to treat wounds, such as the tetrapharmacum and similar.  You should loosen the bandage.
Examine the wound every evening and morning until it heals and is cured.  You should position the limb so that the pus flows downwards easily. If many days pass and the wound does not unite and the pus does not cease, then know that there are small fragments of bone.
You should probe the wound with a probe; whatever of those fragments is loose, extract and remove it; and whatever is not loose, and is causing the limb to fester and producing pain, then work at cutting and extracting it in every way that you are able.
If the wound develops a chill, or gangrene, or another type of corruption and putrefaction, you should treat each symptom with the corresponding treatment which has been previously described in its chapter.
Among the things you should heed and keep in mind is this: if a large bone is fractured and projects from the limb, such as the femur or humerus and similar large members, do not attempt to pull or remove it. Death often results from such an attempt; rather, leave it until it becomes putrid; perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see that it is amenable to treatment; otherwise, leave it.
Chapter Twenty.
In the treatment of the complication which occurs after some fractures.
This complication often arises after the healing of a fracture, especially those near the joints; it disfigures the limb and may prevent it from its natural function.
Examine it; if the complication is fresh, use astringent drugs such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, gum mastic, acacia, and the like. Take some or all of these and mix them with an astringent syrup, or with egg white, or with vinegar.
Apply it to the complication in a bandage and bind it tightly. Leave the bandage in place for many days, then unbind it and reapply another, until the complication disappears, God willing, or bind a tight lead plate to it.
For lead has the property of removing all that is superfluous in the limbs. If the complication has hardened and become severe, and necessity compels its removal, incise it from above and cut away the excess growth, or shave it off with some instrument until it is gone, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In the treatment of a fracture, if it is set but the limb remains afterwards thin and not as it was originally.
If a bone fracture is set, but the limb remains thin and weak afterwards, this is due to many causes. One of these is either due to too much loosening and tightening of the bandages, or to excessive tightening of the bandages so that nourishment cannot reach the limb, or to excessive and repeated bandaging, or to excessive movements at the wrong time, or to a deficiency of blood in the patient's body and its weakness.
The treatment of this is to nourish the patient and enrich his body so that his blood increases, and to use the bath and to bring him joy and happiness and the like, then to apply pitch to the limb so that the pitch attracts much nourishment to it, or to repeatedly bandage it with lukewarm water. until nourishment flows to it and it returns to its natural form.
Chapter Twenty-two.
In the treatment of fractured bones if they are set crookedly and prevented from functioning properly.
Then if a deformity or a projection of the broken bone or a complication appears in a limb that has healed after setting, and the appearance of the limb is thereby made unsightly, unless the limb is prevented from its natural function; it is not proper to accept the opinion of one who claims that the limb should be broken from the head, and many ignorant physicians and bone-setters have done this in our country.
And this action is very reprehensible, leading to great harm, the least of which is disability; but if the crookedness and complication are recent, then it should be softened with water in which relaxing herbs have been cooked, such as mallow leaves and root, and marjoram, and the like.
And it should be bandaged with relaxing bandages such as well-made diachylon, or the sap of mallow root should be taken and beaten with chicken fat and goose grease and bandaged with it, or ripe figs should be taken and pounded with pigeon droppings and the like of medicines called resolvents.
And sometimes the complication will be resolved by constant gentle massage with the hands, and the movement of the limb in every direction should be used at all times; but if the deformity is old and severe and hardened, and treatment with iron is necessary,
then it should be incised above, and the connection of the bone released, and whatever remains of the complication or bone should be cut with fine cuts, and gentleness should be used with effort and care, then the wound should be treated as previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
A dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its place, which hinders movement, disfigures the limb, and causes the patient severe pain and suffering.  Therefore, if a dislocation occurs, one should immediately attempt to reduce it.
It should not be delayed at all, for if it is delayed, the place will swell and become inflamed, making it difficult to reduce the dislocation. Therefore, it should not be delayed, nor should it be moved or stretched while it is swollen, because this often causes the patient spasms and harmful pain.
But if this happens, one should immediately bleed the patient, then leave him until the swelling subsides somewhat. Then bathe the limb with warm water and oil, and then gently reduce it, treating each limb as described in its place.
The chapters on dislocations are also arranged, as in the case of fractures, from the top of the body to the bottom.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
It is rare for both jaws to be dislocated.  Their dislocation occurs in one of two ways: either they are slightly displaced from their positions, relaxing slightly; or they are completely dislocated, so that they relax completely. towards the chest, so that the saliva of the patient flows and he cannot restrain it, nor can he close his jaw, and his tongue stumbles in speech. But if the dislocation is slight, in most cases it returns of its own accord very easily.
But if the dislocation is complete, it is necessary to hasten its reduction quickly and not delay it at all. This is done by having an attendant hold the patient's head, while the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside the mouth, if the jaw is dislocated on one side.
or he inserts both thumbs if the jaw is dislocated on both sides, and the rest of his fingers from the outside, with which he manipulates it, and he orders the patient to relax his jaw and release it to go to every side, and the physician manipulates the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, then use fomentations with hot water and oil until their reduction is facilitated, and do not delay their reduction at all, as we have said.  When they have returned and are straight, and the patient's mouth is closed and they are not relaxed, then apply to them bandages of linen with a plaster made from wax, oil, and rosewater.
Then bind it gently with a loose bandage, and let the patient sleep on his back with his head raised between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right or left, nor does he strain to chew anything, but let his food be soft gruel.
Until the pain is gone and the jaw is set, let him eat whatever he wishes, and let him use it gently and not strain to open his mouth when eating, drinking, or yawning until the jaw is set and healed.
If the reduction of the jaws is difficult, if they are dislocated at some time and do not return to their places, then fevers and persistent headache often result from this, and perhaps the patient's abdomen will become distended, and perhaps he will vomit repeatedly pure bile. If you see this, then know that it is damaged.
And many die from this condition within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On the reduction of the clavicle and the tip of the shoulder.
As for the clavicle, it does not dislocate from the inner side because of its connection to the chest. It may dislocate outwards, and this is apparent to the touch. Its reduction is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms.
Then press the area with your hand strongly, and it will return. Then apply a bandage and compresses and bind it tightly. As for its end which is next to the shoulder and connected to it, it rarely dislocates. If it dislocates, it should be reduced and set as we have mentioned and as you are able.
Then apply a bandage and compresses and bind it tightly, and instruct the patient to observe rest and stillness until it heals. By this same treatment, the tip of the shoulder is also reduced if it has also left its place.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In the reduction of the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder dislocates in three ways: one is that it dislocates towards the armpit downwards; the second is that it dislocates towards the chest; and sometimes it dislocates upwards towards the shoulder, but this is rare.
It does not dislocate to the back because of the shoulder blade, nor does it dislocate to the front because of the nerve. It most often dislocates and comes out downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, because it quickly comes out and quickly goes in.
But as for those who have much flesh, it is otherwise, that is to say, it comes out with difficulty and goes in with difficulty.  Sometimes a blow or a fall happens to some people, and the shoulder swells with a hot swelling, so they think that it has dislocated; it is necessary to examine this until you ascertain its truth.
Then you proceed to its treatment.  The dislocation is recognized if it is downwards towards the armpit: if you compare the dislocated shoulder with the sound shoulder, you will find a clear difference between them; and you will find the head of the shoulder dislocated, and under the armpit, on touching, the head of the shoulder, as if it were an egg.
And the patient is unable to raise his hand to his ear, nor to move it in all movements.  Similarly, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, you will find that apparent to the touch, not hidden.
And this dislocation is easily reduced if it is recent or if the patient is a child.  Its reduction is that a servant raises his hand upwards, then you place your thumbs under his armpit and raise the joint strongly upwards into its place, while the servant raises his hand and extends it upwards.
Then he lowers it downwards, and it returns quickly. If it does not return by what we have mentioned, and the dislocation has been some days, then the patient should bathe in hot water, and use things which relax and soften, such as boiling the root of mallow, fenugreek, and rue in water, and using it.
Then the patient lies on his back, and you place under his armpit a ball of wool, which is moderate between soft and hard. Then the physician places his heel on the ball, and holds the patient's hand with his hand and extends it downwards.
And he pushes the ball with his foot, and it returns to its place. And if you wish, reduce it in this way: you bring a taller man than the patient, and position him at the side, and he puts his shoulder under the patient's armpit and raises his armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air. And another servant pulls the patient's hand towards his lower belly. If the patient is light, then something else should be hung from him to weigh him down, and the jaw will return immediately. And it may also be reduced in another way.
And that is to fix in the ground a long piece of wood, its head round in shape like the pestle of a mortar, neither thick nor thin.  Then it is placed under the patient's armpit, after placing a soft cloth on the head of the wood, and the patient stands along the length of the wood.
Then his hand is extended downwards from the other side, and his body is also extended forcefully from the other side. Then the joint returns to its place quickly. If its reduction is difficult by all that we have mentioned, then use this treatment: take a piece of wood about two cubits long. And its width is about four fingers, and its thickness is about two fingers. It has a round head to facilitate its entry deep into the armpit in this manner:
Then a soft cloth is tied to the round head, lest the wood harm the patient. Then it is placed under the armpit, and the whole hand and arm are extended down along the wood, and the wood is tied to the arm, forearm, and hand.
Then the arm is placed on a crossbeam. Let it be level across, and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is left hanging from the other side. Then the joint enters immediately. If it enters in any way possible, then a moderately sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then the prepared bandage of mill dust, frankincense, and egg white is applied to the whole shoulder, as it goes around from above. Then the ball under the armpit is tightly bound, and the bandage is wound over the bandage from above, and his hand is hung from his neck.
He is left without moving his hand for seven days. The patient's food should be light so that the limb may be strengthened, for this hastens healing. Then, after seven or five days, it is untied and exercised. If it is firm and does not relax, then it is healed.
If the joint dislocates repeatedly due to dampness or another cause, cauterization with three cautery irons should be used, as previously described in the chapter on cauterization. If all this is done and the bandage is removed after seven days and the joint is not stable,
the bandage and binding are repeated many times and it is not stable, and it falls and relaxes and cannot be raised upwards, then know that the nerve in the head of the shoulder is severed, stretched, or relaxed. Then know that the joint will never be stable in its place.
As for the dislocation that occurs towards the chest and breast and to the back, its reduction is by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns. All binding and treatment are used until it heals. If, after healing, stiffness occurs in the limb and movement is slow,
the patient should use the bath repeatedly until that stiffness softens and returns to its former state.
Chapter twenty-seven.
In the treatment of elbow dislocation.
The elbow joint is difficult to dislocate and also difficult to reduce. It dislocates in all directions, especially forward or backward. Its dislocation is not hidden from you, for it is visible and palpable, whatever form the dislocation takes.
If you compare the dislocated elbow with the sound one, it will be clearly evident to you by the deformity of the joint; and he will not be able to bend the arm or touch his shoulder with it. You should hasten to reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot inflammation occurs.
For if a hot inflammation occurs, reduction is difficult, and it may never heal completely, especially if the dislocation is backward; for this is the worst of all types of dislocation, and the most painful, and often death ensues.
And its reduction, if it is possible to reduce it, is done by having an attendant extend his hand with both his hands and arm extended, while the physician's hands are placed above and below the elbow, and he pushes the joint with the thumbs of both his hands, or with the base of his palms, until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is forward, it may be reduced by bending the arm sharply until the base of the hand strikes the corresponding shoulder. If the dislocation does not reduce, then use strong traction, namely, having two attendants extend the arm.
And let two attendants also hold the patient so that he does not move during traction; then the arm is rotated in every direction after wrapping a folded cloth or broad bandage around the hand. And if the physician touches the joint with his hands, let him anoint them with oil, so that the joint may be easily moved.
Then he pushes the joint strongly until it returns. After its return, a bandage should be applied which includes compression and desiccation with egg white, and it is tied tightly, and the arm is hung from the patient's neck and left for several days.
Then it is untied. If the joint is firm in its place, untie the bandage and leave it. But if you see that the joint is not strengthened sufficiently, reapply the bandage and leave it also for several days until it strengthens, then untie it. If a swelling occurs after the reduction of the joint and its unbinding,
and there is difficulty in movement, then let him use fomentation in the bath and gentle massage and manipulation until it softens; or apply a poultice of fat mutton to the joint, then bandage it and leave it on for a day and a night, then remove it and place him in the bath. When he sweats, massage the joint moderately.
Then reapply the poultice once, twice, and three times, with the use of the bath, until it softens.  And if you wish to apply a moist, thin poultice of cow dung with fat and bind it on, do that several times, for it will soften and return to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On the treatment of a dislocated wrist.
The wrist often dislocates, and its reduction is easier than that of other joints, except that it is necessary to hasten its reduction at the time it dislocates, before the place becomes swollen or a hot swelling appears.
To reduce it, place the patient's wrist on a board, and let an assistant extend his hand; then the physician should place his hand on the prominence of the joint and push it until it returns. However, one should look to see if the dislocation has gone to the inside of the hand.
If the dislocation is prominent towards the outside of the hand, let him place the palm of his hand on the board, so that the physician's hand may fall on the same prominence of the joint. If it returns immediately, well and good; otherwise, bind it with a bandage that soothes the swelling.
Leave it and do not manipulate it again, for it will not tolerate it, and you will not be able to reduce it after several days have passed, except that the joint will remain crooked and will not harm the patient, unless the hand becomes relaxed and unable to grasp anything.
Then you know that the nerve is severed or bruised; there is no remedy for it except cauterization, which may or may not be effective. When the reduction of the wrist is complete, apply the bandage we have described, then tighten it and leave it for five days.
Then unbind it and exercise the hand; if its movement is difficult and there is any stiffness in it, soften it with warm water and massage repeatedly until it softens.
Chapter twenty-nine.
In the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may be dislocated in every direction; if a finger is dislocated towards the back or palm of the hand, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns, then bind the head of the finger and suspend it towards the direction in which it was dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it is straight that day. If it is nighttime, bind it in the same manner; continue to unbind it during the day, exercise it with movement, and bind it at night; do this for several days until it strengthens.
Do the same if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand; bind it towards that same direction and do as you did before until it heals.  Do likewise if it is dislocated in any other direction.
Chapter Thirty.
In the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
If a vertebra of the vertebrae of the back or neck is completely dislocated, or if many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no treatment, for death quickly overtakes the patient.
The sign of this is that the patient's excrement passes involuntarily, he is unable to retain it, and often some of his limbs relax, either his legs or his arms, or one of them. But if one vertebra is displaced from its position, it often spontaneously returns.
And its displacement occurs in four directions. That which is displaced backward is called a hump. As for its treatment, one should observe: if the hump has occurred since childhood, there is no treatment for it, and there is no cure at all. But that which occurs from a fall or a blow, and the like...
The ancients mentioned it with various treatments in lengthy descriptions, most of which are not beneficial. I have shortened this, taking what suffices from much of what they presented, through my approximation of the meaning and its explanation, and I have depicted the instrument differently from how they described and explained it.
I say that the hump which occurs in the front of the chest has no remedy and no cure, and the same applies to that which occurs to the sides.  Only that which occurs in the back is treated, specifically by what I describe, which is that the patient is laid on his face.
on a level bench near a wall, and a moist mat is spread beneath him so that his chest is not harmed. Then place an upright wooden post fixed in a hole in the ground at the end of the bench towards his head, and another wooden post towards his feet at the other end of the bench.
And a servant holds the wood, which should not be fixed in the hole, and another servant holds the other in the same manner. Then a soft, tight bandage is wrapped around the patient's chest and under his armpits, and the end of the bandage is extended to the wooden post at his head and tied to it.
Then tighten with another bandage above his hips, above his knees, and at his heels. Then gather all the bandages and tie them to the other wooden post at his feet. Then each servant pulls his wooden post with the bandage, and the two wooden posts do not move from their fixed positions.
except that they are not fixed, as we said.  The physician places his hands firmly on the hump until it returns, or he places a board on it and then leans on the board with his feet until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, then take a board about three cubits long.
and a place is dug in the wall, which we said should be near the patient, into which the end of the board is inserted. Then place the middle of the board on the hump, and the physician places his feet on the other end and pulls strongly until he presses the hump.
and it returns to its place. And if you wish to make it with a hand-twisted screw, you insert two pieces of wood, each a cubit long, into the ground at the head of the patient at the end of the shop, and two pieces of wood at his feet at the end of the shop as well.
Let the distance between each piece of wood be a cubit. And a hole is made in each piece of wood through which the screw passes. And all the wood is firmly fixed in the ground so that it does not move at all. And insert a round stick, which is the screw in which the bandage is twisted, into the holes of the two pieces of wood.
And at its end is a hole in which a stick a cubit long is fixed by twisting. And the same is done in the other two pieces of wood. Then tighten the bandage that you tightened on the patient's chest in the screw at his head, and the bandages that you tightened on his legs in the screw at his feet.
Then a servant stands at each screw, twisting his hand with the tool with which he twists the screw, and the physician levels the hump as we have previously explained. And this is an image of the screw, the shop, and the patient:
Then, after the vertebra returns and the place is level, a drying bandage should be applied with egg white, then lint, and then place on top of the bandage a splint of wood, its width being three fingers or thereabouts, and its length being sufficient to cover the area of the hump.
And on some sound beads, then it is bound with the appropriate bandage, and the patient uses light food until he recovers. If some protrusion remains in the place at the end of the healing, then it is necessary to use medicines that relax and soften, along with using the splint we described for a long time.
And a lead plate may be used in that.  And a protrusion may appear at the end of the vertebrae of the back, and it is thought to be a dislocation, and it is an extra bone that has protruded; do not treat it with this treatment, for death may result.
Chapter Thirty-One.
In the treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and they are not subject to what happens to the other joints of slight displacement and depression. The hip joint is dislocated in four ways.
That is, it is dislocated inwards, outwards, forwards, and backwards. Most often it is dislocated inwards, and rarely forwards or backwards.  The sign of its dislocation inwards is that if you compare the sound leg of the patient with the affected leg, it will be longer.
And the knee will be more bent than the sound one, and the patient will not be able to bend his leg at the groin, and the area near the groin will be clearly swollen, because the head of the femur has gone there.
And the sign of that which is dislocated outwards is that its symptoms are the opposite of these symptoms. And the sign of that which is dislocated forwards is that he extends his leg completely, but he cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he tries to walk, he cannot do so forwards.
And he retains his urine, and his groin swells, and when walking, he treads on his heel. And the sign of that which is dislocated backwards is that he does not extend the knee, and he cannot bend it before bending the groin, and his leg is also shorter than the other.
And the groin is relaxed, and the head of the femur is clearly in the position of the loin. As for the reduction of the types of this dislocation, you should look; if the dislocation is old, having persisted with its sufferer, and no attempt has been made to reduce it, and it remains in its state, then there is absolutely no treatment for it.
So you should not attempt it. As for that which is recently dislocated, whatever its type may be of the four kinds of dislocation, hasten to twist the joint and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and to the left, perhaps...
it will return and will not need any other treatment. If it does not return in this way, then you should prepare a strong and able assistant who will extend his leg from below, either with his hands or with a bandage tied around his leg above the knee, and another assistant who will extend it from above.
so that he puts his hands under his armpits, then tightens a soft bandage on the root of the thigh, and another third assistant holds the end of the bandage, and the extension is either from the front, from the side of the groin to the side of the clavicle, or from the back to the side of the back.
And their extension is all at once, until the patient is raised from the ground with his body and remains suspended. For this type of extension is a common type for the four types. If the dislocation returns as we have said, otherwise, each type needs the special treatment that I will mention.
As for its special reduction, if the dislocation is inwards, the patient should lie on his sound side, then a bandage is applied to the root of the thigh between the head of the thigh and the place under the groin.
Then the bandage is extended upwards from the groin to the upper body towards the clavicle, then another strong and able assistant takes it with his arms and embraces the thick part of the affected thigh and extends it outwards with a strong pull, then it will return to its place.
And this type is easier than the other types of treatment by which this member is reduced. If it is difficult for you and it does not respond to this type of treatment at all, then you should tie the patient's legs together with a strong, soft bandage on the ankles and knees.
And the distance between each of them and its neighbor is four fingers, and the affected leg is extended more than the other by two fingers, then the patient is suspended by the head from a wooden beam in the house, and his distance from the ground is two arms' length.
Then you order a strong boy to embrace the head of the thigh, and another boy hangs onto the patient, and the other boy embracing the thigh pushes strongly, then the joint returns to its place quickly. As for its special reduction if the dislocation is outwards.
Then the patient should lie down on the bench as we described in the case of the hunchback, and a bandage is tightened around his affected leg in particular and his chest, then two wooden planks are placed, one at his feet and the other at his head, then an additional wooden plank is placed in the middle of the bench, very firmly secured.
A wet rag is wrapped around it so that it does not hurt the patient, so that the wooden plank is between his thighs so that he does not slide downwards when stretched, then each servant pulls to his side and the physician sets the hip with his hands, if it responds to reduction.
Otherwise, place the plank on him and press down as we mentioned in the case of the hunchback, except that the patient should lie on his sound side, and if the dislocation is forward, then the patient's leg should be extended once while he is in this same position on the bench.
The physician places the palm of his right hand on the affected hip, then presses it with the other hand, and with that he makes the pressure extend downwards towards the knee. If the dislocation is backward, then the patient should not be extended downwards.
And he is raised off the ground, but rather he should be placed on something solid, just as it should also be if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we mentioned concerning his lying on the bench on his face with the bandages tightened.
As we said before, and the pressing with the plank should also be used on the place to which the joint has gone.  If the hip joint returns completely as it should, and the sign of its return will not be hidden from you, which is that you extend the patient's legs.
If you see them straight and the patient can flex and extend the leg without difficulty, then know that the member has returned as it should. Then, bind the thighs together, apply the bandage and tighten it with a turban so that the hip does not move in any direction.
And the patient must remain still for three or four days. Then untie the bandage and compare the leg to the other; if you see them equal in size, then know that the fracture has healed, so allow the patient to walk. And if you see some laxness in it…
then return and bandage it and tighten it according to your first tightening, and leave it also for three days, then untie it, and let him walk slowly on it for days until it strengthens, God willing.
Chapter thirty-two.
In the treatment of a fracture of the knee.
The knee dislocates in three ways: inwards, outwards, and downwards, that is to say backwards; it does not dislocate forwards at all.  The sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to bring his leg towards his thigh.
If it does not adhere to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated. The treatment for all types of its dislocation is that you make the patient sit with his legs extended if he is able to do so, and a servant sits behind him to hold his waist and twist him slightly backwards, then you sit on his thighs.
And you place your back against his face and put his leg between your legs, then you grasp his knee with your hands and interlock your fingers on his knee, then you press with your hands strongly on both sides of his knee, and another servant extends his leg until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh softly and without force. Then bandage it and adhere the leg to the thigh, then bind them both with a bandage for three or four days, then release them. And he should only use a little walking for some days until it strengthens.
If you are unable to return it by what we have described, then use strong traction with the bandages which I previously described in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three
In the treatment of the dislocation of the heel.
The heel may be dislocated slightly, or it may be completely dislocated.  Its dislocation is either inwards or outwards, and the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen and prominent in the direction in which it dislocated.
As for the treatment of its slight displacement, it is easy to return it; this is done by gently stretching it with the hands and straightening it until it returns. As for its treatment if it is completely dislocated, it is necessary that you seat the patient, and a strong servant should hold him from behind his back at his waist.
Then you grasp his foot with your right hand from above and with your left hand from below the foot at the place of the heel; then pull the foot towards you with your right hand and then with your left twice; then straighten it with your left hand and push the front of the foot with your right hand towards the leg without force.
Do this twice as we have described, then push the front of the foot towards the leg on the third occasion while you pull at the heel. If it returns in one or two times in this way and you see the foot straight, otherwise repeat the procedure, for it will return.
If it refuses to return by what we have described, then lay the patient on his back on the ground and firmly fix a wedge in the ground so that it lies between his thighs, having wrapped a cloth around it so that it does not harm the patient; then a servant should hold his thigh.
Then another servant stretches the leg, either with his hands or with a bandage which he ties around the neck of the leg; then each servant stretches in the opposite direction to his companion, the wedge remaining between the patient's thighs holding it so that his body is not pulled downwards during the stretching; then the physician sets the joint with his hands.
And another servant holds the sound leg below, for the joint returns quickly; and when the joint returns and you are certain of its correct return, apply the dressing and bandage and tighten it with firm bandages and bind the foot below with a bandage; and it is necessary to protect the nerve which is above the heel from behind.
lest the bandage be tight upon it and harm it; then leave it for two or three days. If the bandage loosens, tighten it, then loosen it on the third or fourth day, and the patient must abstain from walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this time, you cannot be sure that the joint will not be dislocated again and become spoiled and will not then accept treatment; if a hot swelling appears, it is necessary to use for its alleviation what we have previously described in another place in the treatment and cleansing until it disappears.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
In the treatment of the dislocation of the toes of the foot.
It is necessary to set what is dislocated by gentle traction without force; this is not difficult but easy. If the dislocation is in some of the joints of the instep, it is necessary that the patient place his foot on a level surface of the ground.
Or on a board while he is standing as if walking; then you stand and place your foot on the dislocated joint, and then press down on it with your foot strongly until it returns and you see that it is straight and there is no protrusion in the place.
Then place under the sole of his foot a board that takes the whole foot, which has two ends; then bind it tightly and securely for three days, then unbind it and keep him from walking for many days until it strengthens and the return is prevented, God willing.
Chapter thirty-five.
On the types of dislocation which occurs with a wound or with a fracture or with both together.
When something like that happens and you attempt its treatment and setting, it often results in death.
Therefore, no one should undertake the treatment of such a thing except someone skilled in the craft, experienced, gentle, compassionate, careful, not reckless or rash, and that he should initially use only medications that soothe hot swellings and leave the patient alone.
By God's power, except what you hoped for its safety from harm with mildness of the disease and some hope appeared to you in it, then return it immediately at the first instance before the hot swelling appears.
If the limb returns to what you intended, then use the treatment that soothes hot swellings and treat the wound with suitable drying ointments; if the dislocation is with a fracture and there are detached bone fragments, then remove them. And follow in that what we mentioned in the simple diseases that preceded in their places.
And strive your best and refrain from entering the path of uncertainty, as I previously advised you, for that is safer for your reputation and more secure for your honor, God willing.
