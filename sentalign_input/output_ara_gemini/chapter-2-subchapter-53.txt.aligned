We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medicines and the warning against treating it with iron so that it does not ulcerate.	We have spoken, in the relevant section, of the kinds of cancer and of the way in which medical treatment of them is to be attempted; with a warning against treatment by the knife lest they ulcerate.	0.8085194
And we mentioned the cancer generated in the uterus and the warning against treating it.	We also mentioned the cancer arising in the uterus and gave a warning against its treatment.	0.93661624
And the ancients mentioned that whenever the cancer is in a place where it can be completely eradicated, such as the cancer that is in the breast or in the thigh and similar accessible organs, to remove it entirely, especially if it is nascent and small.	The Ancients said that when a cancer is in a site where total eradication is possible, such as a cancer of the breast or of the thigh, and in similar parts where complete removal is possible, and especially when in the early stage and small, (then surgery was to be tried).	0.82403237
But when it is advanced and large, it should not be approached, for I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me reach that.	But when it is of long standing and large you should leave it alone. For I myself have never been able to cure any such, nor have I seen anyone else succeed before me.	0.80238914
And the procedure in it, if it is accessible as we said, is that you proceed to purge the patient with black bile several times, then bleed him if there is a clear fullness in the veins.	The procedure in a case amenable to treatment, as we have said, is first for the patient to be purged several times from black bile; then bleed him if his veins seem full.	0.8533194
Then you position the patient in a position that allows you to work, then you place in the cancer the hooks that are suitable for it, then you scrape it from every side with the skin thoroughly so that nothing of its roots remains. And let the blood flow and do not cut it off quickly, but squeeze the areas and drain all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever instruments you can.	Then put the patient in the most convenient position for operating. Then attach to the tumour hooks suited to it; then make a circular incision all round to include the skin with the utmost thoroughness so that not the least root of it remains; let the blood flow and do not stanch it quickly; but put pressure upon the place and squeeze out all the thick blood, either by hand or with any instrument you can.	0.8680441
If you encounter in the procedure a large bleeding from the cutting of an artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.	If in operating you get a very severe haemorrhage from cutting an artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops; then dress in the usual way until healed.	0.87059903
