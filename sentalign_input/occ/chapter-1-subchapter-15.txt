Chapter Fifteen:
On the Cauterization of Softening of the Eyelids.
When the eyelid is softened by disease or humidity, cauterize the eyelid with a lunar-shaped cautery; and this is its form:
And if you wish, cauterize both eyebrows slightly with two cauteries in all parts, and they should extend from the temples.
And the length of each cautery should be according to the size of the eyebrow.
Do not press too hard with the cautery, but just enough so that a third of the eyelid is affected.
