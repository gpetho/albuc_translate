The treatment of fire by iron
Another type of disease there is called "corrodens", and it is nothing other than an eating away of a member, because it eats the members like fire eats dry wood. If you see this disease in a place that can suffer cautery with fire, then heat the clavile cauteries, both small and large, according to what is needed for the place where the disease is; afterward, cauterize it on all sides until you remove all the corruption, and nothing remains of it, so that everything that is corrupted is removed. And then leave it for three days, and put on the cauterized places ground sulfur with oil until the burns from the fire are removed, and all the corruption. Afterward, treat with ointments that generate flesh.  And if you see after three days that healthy flesh is not growing, it is good; and if not, repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted places. And this eating away has sometimes been cured with sharp medicine instead of fire cautery; but nevertheless, fire cautery is of greater help, and I have already said the cure of sharp medicine in the division: take it when you need it.
