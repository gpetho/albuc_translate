Chapter XXIV
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
The two jaws are dislocated if they do not close properly; and the dislocation of both is caused in one of two ways: either they are slightly out of place and slightly loosened; or they are completely dislocated and entirely out of place, causing looseness at the joint, making the patient's saliva flow uncontrollably and preventing them from closing their mouth, and their speech is affected.
But when the dislocation is slight, it often returns to its place by itself with minimal cause.
But if the dislocation is complete and entire, then the reduction must be performed gently and without delay.
The procedure involves the assistant holding the patient's head, while the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the dislocated side of the jaw inside the mouth if the dislocation is on one side; or inserts both thumbs together if both sides are dislocated, with the other fingers outside to grip; and instructs the patient to relax their jaw and move it from side to side; the physician then aligns the jaw and pushes it back into place.
If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, then apply steam with warm water and oil, making the reduction easier, and do not delay in reducing both as previously mentioned.
Once they are returned and aligned, and the patient's mouth is closed and not loosened, then place on them cloth dusted with a plaster made of wax and rose oil; and gently bind it with soft bandages.
The patient should sleep on their back, with their head supported between two pillows, so it doesn't turn to the right or left; do not force them to chew anything; rather, their food should be liquid until the pain subsides and the jaws are set, then they can chew what they want.
This should be managed with ease, and do not stress the opening of the mouth for eating, drinking, or yawning, until the jaw is set and healed.
If it is difficult to reduce both jaws when dislocated and they are not returned to their place, then often this causes fever and persistent sweating, and soon the patient's stomach becomes upset, and they frequently vomit pure bile.
When you see this, know that it is a bad sign; and often the person who experiences this dies within ten days.
