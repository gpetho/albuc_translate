O, children, since I have completed this book for you, which is the last of the science of medicine, by completing it, its end is reached, and by the explanations and declarations contained therein, it seems to me that I fulfil this for you with this treatise, which is a part of the surgical operation with my hands.
For the surgical operation is widespread in our region and in our time, deprived of everything, so that the knowledge of it, and its practice, is lost; and there remain only a few small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which have been misinterpreted and have led to error and hesitation, such that the understanding of it is clouded and its power and art are distant.
And it seems to me that I will revive that [the surgical operation] through the organization of this treatise, following the path of exposition, declaration, and summarization; and so that it will come with the forms of cautery tools and other instruments of the craft, either by adding to the explanation, or by preparation for it, which is necessary.
But the reason why a skilled craftsman is not found with his hands in our time is that the art of medicine is extensive, and its practitioner must previously be exercised in the science of anatomy, which encompasses the knowledge of the body's limbs and their forms, their connections and separations; and possess knowledge of the bones, nerves and tendons, their number, and their paths; and of the pulsing veins and quiet veins, and the locations of their origin.
And for that reason Hippocrates says that by name it is much, but in practice little, and especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already said this in the introduction to this book; for whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have discussed regarding anatomy is not free from falling into error, by which men will die, as I have seen many such, for some are trained in this science and yet proceed without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish and unskilled physician attempt to lance a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck, and cut some of the neck's arteries, so that much blood flowed until the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another physician attempt to remove a stone from a man who had reached old age, and the stone was large, and he went to the man and extracted the stone along with a piece of the bladder, so that the man died on the third day.
And I already, having fled to escape it, saw that because of the size of the stone and the disposition of the patient, I knew beforehand that he would die.
And I saw another physician who received a stipend from a duke in our land for surgery, and went to a dark-skinned man whose thigh was fractured; and through the physician's ignorance, he attempted to fix the fracture, over the wound, with splints and bandages with great force, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And then he unbound it according to his desires, and then he reapplied it, and then left it for several days and ordered that we unbind the ligature; and it remained like that until the thigh and the leg became abscessed, and he ended up perishing.
And I was called to him, and I proceeded to loosen the ligature, and tranquility was achieved, and thus he was relieved of his pains.
However, already corruption had taken hold in the limb, so that I could not restrain it, and the corruption continued to spread in the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another physician who opened a cancerous abscess, and it became ulcerated over several days, until the severity of it was magnified by the patient's condition.
Because the cancerous wound is purely of melancholic humor, therefore it should not be treated with complete cauterization, but rather the limb in which it occurs should be amputated entirely.
And therefore, children, it is necessary for you that the surgical procedure be divided into two parts: one is the procedure associated with healing, and the other is the work which poses risk in the most critical cases.
And I have already shown this throughout this book where the operation involves mistakes and fear; therefore, it is necessary for you to avoid this and abandon it, so that bad words find no way to speak ill of you and disgrace you.
Therefore, take your tools with diligence and God's protection, and treat your patients with kindness and firmness.
And use the best methods, by God's grace, seeking health and praiseworthy success, and leave the terrible illnesses of difficult cure, and remove from your tools that which causes you fear, so that the reputation of your skill and your name is not lost: for greater is remaining glory, and more exalted in the world, and behind your sanctity.
Guilia already said in some of his teachings/instructions: Do not treat a serious illness, so that you are not called bad doctors.
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
The division of the book begins, and first of the first part. The first chapter is ordered from head to foot, regarding the forms of instruments and the tools of cauteries, and what is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, on cutting and piercing, and on cupping, and on poultices, and on the extraction of arrows and similar things, is entirely categorized and ordered by the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, on restoration and dislocation, and on the treatment of twisting and similar things; a chapter ordered from head to foot, and regarding the forms of the instruments.
It is necessary for me to describe the benefits of this cautery and its harms, and in which constitution cautery is prohibited.
Therefore, I say that the discourse on the benefits and harms of cautery is long, verbose, scientifically subtle, and secretly hidden; and many learned people have spoken about it, and they have disagreed, and it suffices for me to take a little from their discourse, fearing to be too lengthy.
And therefore I say that cautery benefits every constitution universally, whether with or without matter, except for two constitutions, which are hot constitutions without matter.
In the hot and dry constitution with matter, there is disagreement; for some say that cautery is helpful in that case, and others say the opposite, that cautery is not appropriate in an illness caused by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is inconvenient that a hot and dry illness be cured with something that is also hot and dry.
And he who says the opposite argues that cautery is beneficial in all hot and dry illnesses affecting the body, because when you compare the body and its humours to the constitution of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I say, based on this argument, that experience has shown me this to be true on several occasions.
However, this should not be taken by someone who has not already been experienced and practiced in the chapter on cautery, and who has not learned about the diversity of human constitutions and the nature of illnesses, their causes, their symptoms, and the time frame in which they occur.
But in other constitutions, there is no such concern, and especially in cold and moist illnesses, for all doctors have agreed upon this, and are not divided on the use of cautery in these cases.
And know, children, that the secret of curing with cautery by fire, and its efficacy, rests in contrast to cauterizing with a burning medicine, for fire is simple, its action only reaches the part cauterized, and does not harm other parts associated with it, except for minor damage.
But the action of burning medicine extends to those parts of the body located further away, and it easily causes difficult-to-heal illnesses and severe pain in the affected area.
However, fire, due to its inherent nature and goodness, does not cause this, but only superfluity.  And we already know this from experiment and from the long study of the art, regarding the truth of causes; therefore, I am excused from a lengthy explanation.  And if it were not that my book, on this topic,  conceals the secret of treating with fire, and its effect on the body, and the manner in which it expels diseases, with a philosophical, demonstrable discussion – that would be a matter suitable to your wisdom.
And know, children, that they disagree on the time when it is best to apply cautery, and they suggest the best time is spring.
And I say that cautery is appropriate at any time, because the harm from accidental timing is outweighed by the benefit derived from the cautery, especially if the cautery is for painful or necessary conditions, intense and urgent, which cannot tolerate delay because the feared harm is greater than the minor harm resulting from the timing.
And this does not apply to your wisdom, or children, this is only considered by the ignorant populace and foolish physicians, that is, that not every illness treated with cautery is a cure for all time, and they fail to consider this consequence.
And the cause is not at all as they suppose, for cautery is only a method of medicine that alters the complexion and dries the humidity which is the cause of pain.
But nevertheless, cautery is superior to other medical treatments because of its power, its effectiveness, and the greatness of its master.
And it is possible that the illness may return at some time, depending on the patient's constitution, the location of the illness, the patient's strength, and the accumulation of superfluities within the body, and what they have consumed in food and similar matters;  however, if the illness for which cautery is administered is a subtle ailment in a limb with few superfluities and humors, like toothache and similar conditions, it is possible that the pain will not return, but this is usually a short-term effect.
And it is a common saying that cautery is the last resort in medicine, and it is a true statement, not in the way they understand it, for they believe there is no cure that is as effective as cautery.
The truth is the opposite.  The idea that cautery is the last resort in medicine is only true when we have tried other methods of treatment for some illnesses, and those treatments are ineffective, and only then is cautery used as a last resort, and it can be effective in that situation. Therefore, the idea that cautery is the last resort in medicine is not as the common people and foolish doctors understand it.
The ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this without reason, due to the equal and superior nature of gold's substance.
And they said that the location for cautery does not matter, but this is not entirely true, for I have proven this and found that it only works on certain bodies, not others, and cautery with gold is indeed better than with iron as they said; however, when you use gold to cauterize with fire, it's not as straightforward as they describe, because it burns away in proportion to how much you want it to through the gold's hardness, and because it prepares to receive cold; and if you add a flame to it, the gold melts with the heat, and some gold slips into the fire, so the craftsman loses it through this procedure.
Therefore, cautery with iron is done more easily and more accurately with respect to the correct execution of the procedure.
And I have organized this chapter on cautery according to sections, and have ordered them from head to feet, so that the inquirer can find what they want in it.
The first chapter.
This cauterization treats the moisture and cold affecting the brain, the causes of which are twofold: one is the cause of a cold, copious rheumatic flux, called a cold, flowing from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and copious sleep, and toothache and sore throat, and generally any illness arising from cold, such as paralysis, apoplexy, and similar ailments.
The method for this cauterization is this: first, you instruct the patient to take a laxative to cleanse the head for three or four nights, according to the patient's strength, age, and usual constitution.
And then instruct him to shave his head, and then place him on a smooth bench with your hands on his feet.
And then place the blade of your palm near the bridge of his nose between his eyes. However, when the middle finger has reached that spot, mark the spot with a probe, and then apply the olive cautery, the form of which is as follows:
Then place that [cautery] on the spot marked by the probe, so that it descends, while your hand is gradually tightened, and you rotate it.
Then gently remove your hand and observe the area.  If you see any significant portion of bone exposed, roughly the size of a grain of millet, then raise your hand; if not, return your hand with that iron, and with another of the same kind, if it is chilled, until you can see the bone as I have described to you.
Then take a small amount of salt and dissolve it over the area, and leave it for three days.
Then apply a cloth soaked in water and leave it there until the scab from the fire has been destroyed. And then treat the area with tetrafarmacon unguent until it is healed.
And if the wound remains open, it is better to raise the arm, as this is more beneficial and helpful.
And some of them say that the bone should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until some part of the bone's tissue is burned.
And then whatever is burned to the bone should be scraped off, and then treated.
And others say that with the cautery they should reach the back [of the affected area], applying strong pressure until the bone breaks, and this is the method of minor cauterization: And they believe that from that place, the vapors of the head are escaping.
And the wound should be kept open for a long time, and then treated until it is healed.
However, I have not seen these two types of cauterization in all cases, but only in some men, according to a fearful method;  and, in my view, better is healing, when possible; for the head is weakened by a rupture of its continuity, just as we have witnessed in other members, and especially when the patient's head is of frail nature.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion; and with that method and work, there is healing.
Second Chapter.
Of the cauterization of the head.
When chronic and prolonged pain affects the entire head of a prolonged illness, and remedies such as leeches, cupping, head purges, plasters, compresses, poultices, and similar treatments have been used, and especially if the head has already been cauterized with a cautery that doesn't benefit from any of those remedies, then consider this: if the patient's head is strong in its nature, and isn't frail, but shows a significant amount of cold, then cauterize below the first cautery a little. And then cauterize that area above the patient's temple with a cautery until the skin is broken. Cut through the skin until the bone is exposed to the extent we have described, and cauterize that with a cautery on the back of the head in the area called the "vas" – which is the location where a cupping vessel is placed. And ease your hand in doing this, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will experience very great pain, different from the pain of other cauterizations of the head.
And I will say this about the cautery in its place, for the cautery used to cauterize the temples and the back of the head should be a finer cautery than the one used for the middle of the head; and this is the way to do it.
Third Chapter.
Concerning the cauterization of non-chronic migraines.
When there is persistent pain in the head, or pain that extends to the eye, the head should be purged with medicaments, and the other treatments mentioned in my descriptions of illnesses should be administered.  If all else fails, cauterization in such cases can be done in two ways: either with a sharp, burning medicament, or with iron.
However, cauterization with a burning medicine is done by taking a clove of garlic, squeezing it, and scraping the ends of it from both ends. Then, you should cut the painful area on the temple with a sharp lancet, until a small pit is formed under the skin, so that it is concealed.
Then, apply pressure to it with a compress to constrict it, and leave it in place for three hours.  Then remove it, and take away the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days.  Then, apply a cotton pad soaked in vinegar, until the area is healed.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines, which I have written about in the second treatise on burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron, according to this method: heat the cautery iron, for which this is the procedure:
and it is called "clavus clavillis," because the head of it is shaped like a nail, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it is a small protrusion.
Then place it on the painful area, and hold your hand (so that the underlying artery is not harmed) and turn the iron little by little with speed.
And if the amount adhered by the sharpness of the cautery is about half of it, then lift your hand so that the artery underneath isn't harmed, so that there isn't a flow of blood.
Then soak cotton in salt water and place it on the area, and leave it for three days; and then place cotton soaked in butter, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the tip of the scalpel, according to cautery, and be careful not to cut an artery in this particular, not-ancient, procedure.
Fourth Chapter.
Of the cauterization of ancient migraines.
When you treat a migraine with what we have said about the previous treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment is not effective, and sometimes because the illness does not respond to what we have said about the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire, then you should heat the scalpel cautery until it is white-hot, then apply it to the painful area in a long line, about half the length of a finger, or a little less; and hold your hand steady until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful about the continuity of the jaw, which is strained by chewing, and that the ligaments and nerves that control it are not inflamed or cause spasms.
And if it is about guarding and being careful of the flow of blood from the severed artery, because in severing it there is fear, especially for someone who doesn't understand what they are doing and is not skilled and experienced; and leaves the operation incomplete at the beginning.
And I will come back to the treatment of accidental blood flow from the artery according to its method, in its place in this book.
And if you see that this treatment is not effective for this illness and see the patient's condition is tolerable, cauterize the affected area in the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound until it heals.
And if you wish, apply the cautery we mentioned in the chapter on artery constriction with a cautery having two blades; this is a better and more effective cauterization.
Chapter 5.
Of cauterization for ear pains.
When pain in the ear comes from cold and is treated with laxative remedies and other treatments as previously described, and the pain does not subside, then apply the cautery, specifically the one called 'puncta', of which this is the form:
Then, apply the heated cautery point near the ignition, and move it around the entire ear, in a circular motion, or on each affected spot if the pain is localized. Move the cautery along the ear's base, slowly, after marking the location with a probe.
And if the cautery makes ten points on the whole ear, then treat those areas until they are healed.
Chapter 6.
Of the cauterization of tumors.
Tumors which are cured by cauterization are only of the types that come from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid cauterization of the type that comes from dryness or spasm of the nerve.
When you treat that type of tumor with poultices, emetics, and other remedies, and your treatment is unsuccessful, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: the first at the root of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the diseased area, for softening only occurs in the healthy-appearing area.
And the method of cauterization is to cauterize at the right side of the ear's extremity, a little above the temple bone; and another at the temple, the length of which should be equal to the length of the finger (or thumb), and hold the cautery until about half of the affected area is burned.
And this is the method of cauterization, and it is a type of surgery, the method of which is described beforehand. However, it is more subtle than what you have seen; and the knife should remove a little of the excess fat.
And then treat the area with what has been previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
Concerning the cauterization of old apoplexy.
When apoplexy is old, and you have treated it with what we have described, and your treatment is not effective, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize the patient with four cauteries: on each temple, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, and with a cautery on the throat. And the method of cauterization is done according to what has been stated above.
And it has already been cauterized on the mouth of the stomach; and it is further back; and soon after it should be treated with what you proceed with.
Chapter 8.
Of cauterization for forgetfulness, done by fire.
Large jars and pills must be given to the patient at the beginning, to purify the brain.
And then shave the entire head of the patient and place a plaster of the kind described in the treatise on plasters on their forehead.
And apply it several times, for that is a way of cauterization. And do this according to the same order which I have already described.
And so, if this treatment is successful; and if not, then apply three cauteries to the back of their head, descending from the highest part of the head to the lowest part of the neck. And place the width of a finger between each cautery, and then treat the cautery with what has been previously described.
But if you desire more and the patient tolerates it, then apply a cautery to the middle part; and if you desire even more, then cauterize it above the two horns.
Then treat it until it is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped, according to the form previously given.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the cauterization of paralysis and the softening of the entire body.
You should proceed with the cleansing of the head with herbs and what we have said; and then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with cauteries on all the horns of the head, and with a cautery on the back part of it, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if in the disease of softening of the body, the patient is weak and the illness is severe, then cauterize the patient with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and continuously with a cautery until it is softened considerably, and remove your hand. And then treat him until he is healed, and this should be an olive oil cautery.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the cauterization of epilepsy.
The epileptic is not cauterized unless the epilepsy is due to phlegm.
Therefore, it is necessary to treat his brain at the beginning with herbs and the other treatment we have described in the division when the illness is severe and can tolerate the exception of medicines.
And if it is a child who does not tolerate the medicines, then administer balms and masticatories that will treat the brain, beforehand for many days, with good dietary adjustments.
Then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, according to the previous method, and with another cautery on the back of his head, and cauterize on each of his temples. And if the illness is severe and can tolerate it, then cauterize it with the cauteries I have mentioned, having simultaneously paralysis and softening of the body upon the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
Let the cautery be olive-oil based, as previously described.
But if the patient is a child, then apply a delicate cautery according to this method.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the cauterization of melancholia.
When the causes of melancholia are corrupted humidity and thick phlegm, then cauterize it with the cauteries we have mentioned in the section on paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholia is a superfluity inclining towards melancholia, and the patient's body is moist, then give him to drink what purifies his brain, according to what has been stated previously in the division (or section).
And then shave the patient's head, and then apply a properly made cupping glass to the area of the scalp, and place it in the middle of the head.
And the patient should be seated upright, and held steady on all sides.
And then apply a liniment; and a good old sheep's wool is most suitable. And warm that over the fire with a moderate heat, which the patient can tolerate when it is placed on him. And then place that in the middle of the patient's head, within the cupping glass, and leave it until it cools.
And do this with the patient once a week, with the other treatment for him until he is healed; or if you want, cauterize that by making small punctures according to the patient's tolerance, but keep your hand with a cautery prepared in this way: this type of cautery moistens the brain evenly.
And then place that cloth soaked in broth or hen's grease.
Chapter 12.
On the cauterization of descending water in the ear.
When you have observed the beginning of water in the ear, based on the signs I described in the division, then begin and give the patient to drink something that will dry his head and protect it from all moisture.
And have him sweat in a bath for a few days.
Then command him to shave his head and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head; and then cauterize it with two cauteries on the two temples if it is the beginning of the spreading of water in both ears, or on one side if it is the beginning of water in one ear.
Cut with a cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin; and let the cauteries be at that length, in the width of the temples.
And beware of blood flows when it is cauterized; and if you see blood flows from him, stop them with any medicine that is possible for you.
And I will come with the knowledge that is in the extraction of arteries and with the excision of those and caution about blood flows.
And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck, under two bones, with two cauteries placed directly upon them.
Chapter 13.
Of the cauterization of old tears.
When tears of the eyes are old, persistent, and through the veins and arteries which are apparent in the area of the head's exterior, and it is verified that this is excess of cold phlegmatic material, then cauterize that area with the cautery that we described in the chapter of heating water in the eyes,  and use a cautery in the middle of the head and two cauteries in the neck below the temples, and two cauteries in the neck below the bones. And if more treatment is needed, then cauterize that area along the entire side of the eye socket on the browbone/eyebrow area with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
Of the cauterization of nasal foul odor.
If your treatment with the methods we've discussed in the previous section is ineffective, then prepare and give the patient decoctions to drink for three nights; then shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium-sized cautery and an olive-oil-based cautery. And then cauterize the area with a clove-shaped cautery, using two cauteries, one small one above each eyebrow under the hair.
And be careful of the flame, so that you do not burn it.
And this is the shape of the clove-shaped cautery.
Chapter 15.
Of cauterization for softening the eyelids of the eyes.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with a cautery using this lunar cautery; and this is its shape:
And if you, cauterize that area above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries on every side, and let them extend away from the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the amount of the eyebrow.
And do not press your hand too hard with the cautery, but just enough that the third part of the eyelid is adhered.
Chapter 16.
Concerning cauterization of the eyelid when the hairs are turned inward and cause the eye to become inflamed.
When the hairs of the eye are turned inward causing inflammation, cauterization in those cases is done in two ways: either with a burning iron or with a medicinal burn.
If with a cautery of fire, first instruct the patient to remove the hairs as one would shave them, until they are pulled out and cut; and if the inflammation is near the eyelashes, then you should bandage the eye to prevent movement until the hairs have grown back.
Then, once the hairs have grown back and are trimmed, place the patient's head on your lap, and carefully make a mark on the eyelid with a probe, marking it with a shape similar to a myrtle leaf, starting near the hairs.
And then place cotton soaked in egg white or in a poultice of ptilli on the eye.
And then apply the cautery, which has this form.
And then cauterize over the marked area, little by little, multiple times, until the surface of the inflamed area, which resembles a myrtle leaf, is completely burned.
A sign of successful treatment is that you see the eyelid contracted and the hairs raised towards the eye's puncture point.
And then lift your hand and leave it for three days, and then place cotton with a bandage over it until the scab has healed. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if any cause returns to the hairs' origin, and the eyelid is softened, then repeat the cauterization in the same way as you did initially.
But if the hairs are beneath the eyelid, then cauterize them until they are raised to their natural position, and are smoothed so the hairs no longer irritate the eye.
But the cautery with a burning medicine, which is what you order the patient to do, is to let the hairs grow out and smooth them, and then a leaf-shaped piece of cloth is made in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
And then take known herbs and living vinegar.  And mix those things well, and do this quickly so it doesn't get cold; and then spread this mixture onto the cloth shaped like a myrtle leaf, and place this over the affected eye or both eyes; and put a cloth soaked in egg white under the eye, and the patient's head should be supported by you.
And place your finger on the medicine and press it slightly, but do not remove it until the patient feels the medicine's burning sensation, for the burning sensation should be like that of fire.
And when the patient perceives the burning sensation, then remove the medicine and wash it away with your finger; then, when the burning subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.  Then consider if the eyelid has been raised as intended through the burning or incision, because if it is, then the procedure is complete; and if not, return to applying the medicine to the area not previously treated, and don't stop until the procedure is successful and the eye is healed.
And then apply a cloth over it until the burn's pain is gone, and then treat it with a healing ointment or another treatment until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, in the course of your treatment, to carefully watch that nothing of the medicine gets into the eye.  And if, after a few days, the eyelid is softened and any hairs have fallen into the eye, then reapply your medicine to the softened part of the eyelid, just as you did at first, and continue until it is healed.
And this is the method using myrtle leaves.
And know that the eyes of men vary in size and smallness, and therefore your treatment is tailored accordingly.
And the path to recovery will not be hidden from the one who studies this art.
Chapter 17.
Of the cauterization of fistulas that are in the tear duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula using the methods described in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment isn't successful, you must cauterize it in this way: instruct the patient to place their head on your lap, and have another attendant hold the patient's head between your hands, so it doesn't move or shake.
And then place a piece of cotton soaked in egg white or in a ptilli mucilage (plant based adhesive) on the patient's eye.
And then apply the cautery, which has this form:
which is concave, like the shape of a reed or a hawk's feather, on the end where the cautery is made.
And if desired, it can be pointed at the other end. And if you want, it can be shaped like a probe.
However, the concave one is better for your work.
And then press the fistula if it is open, and drain and dry it. And if it is not open, then open it and remove the pus from it.
Then place the cautery, which is well-heated, upon it, and hold your hand a short distance from the cautery near the edge of the nostril, so that neither your hand nor the patient is disturbed, and then place the cautery on the edge of the nostril and cauterize it.
And so if at the beginning your cautery penetrates the bone, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if needed; and leave it thus for three days, and then apply a bandage with a cloth and surround it with a drying ointment until it is healed.
But if more than ten days have passed and it is not healed, then apply a sharp, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and is scraped as is appropriate in its chapter.
And there is another way of cauterizing a fistula, which some earlier practitioners said:  Cut into the place of the fistula and make it open, then place into that fissure a thin strip of material of which its form is [described] (or: shape). And pour into this fissure a quantity of melted lead, hold your hand to steady it (and be sure it is applied correctly) so that the melted lead does not injure the opening; and you should place on the opening of the patient a bandage soaked in albumen (egg white) or water, because the lead adheres to the place of the fistula and heals it with a marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed by what we have mentioned about the cautery and its treatment, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to administer a treatment through the nose and reduce the fistula to the nasal passage according to its proper place.
Chapter 18.
On the cauterization of the fissure (or split) of the pot (or possibly:  of the abscess).
Often fissures occur in the lips, especially in the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat those fissures with what we have described in the previous sections and your treatment is not effective, then apply a small, knife-like cautery in this manner (which follows):
And its (the cautery's) concavity should be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then carefully place that heated cautery on those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
And then treat it with a plaster until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
Of cauterization of fistulas in the mouth.
When an abscess develops at the root of the uvula, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, and it then forms a fistula, and it breaks open, and becomes chronic, and pus flows and a fistula is formed, and you treat it, and it does not respond to treatment, then you must apply a cautery according to the size of the opening in the fistula, and then place that heated cautery into the opening of the fistula, and hold it until the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and do this one or two times; and then treat it with whatever we have said about treatment until it is healed.
And therefore, if the pus is removed and the wound is healed, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to expose the area and remove the corrupted bone, as described in its corresponding chapter.
Chapter 20.
Of cauterization of the teeth and softening of the gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are decayed, and you treat them with medicines, but it does not help, then place the patient's head in your lap, and then heat the cautery, the shape of which will be appropriate, so that you position the cannula over the tooth and quickly insert the heated cautery into it, holding it a short time until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth.
And then remove your hand, and then repeat the cauterization several times as you wish.
And then the patient should fill their mouth with salt water and keep it in for an hour, and then spit it out, for the decayed tooth is sealed, the softened gums are strengthened, and the corrupted moisture is dried out.
Chapter 21.
Of the cauterization of toothache.
When toothache is caused by cold, or there is cold or a worm inside, or you do not consider medical treatment appropriate, then cauterization in that case is done in two ways: either cauterization with cow dung or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with dung is done by taking cow dung, boiling it in an iron pot, and then taking a piece of cloth and wrapping it around the tip of a probe.  Then, dip that cloth in the boiled dung and quickly place it on the aching tooth until it cools down.
And then repeat this several times until the heat's effect reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, you can soak wool or cloth in the aforementioned dung and place it over the aching tooth, then place a heated iron on top of that until the iron reaches the point of the tooth's cavity.
However, cauterization with fire involves taking a heated needle or iron, ensuring it has enough thickness so that the heat doesn't reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery, the shape of which will be appropriate, and place it on the tooth while holding it until the cautery cools.  Do this several times, for the pain will cease either that day or the next.
And it is necessary that, through the pressure of the cautery, the patient fill their mouth with good dung and hold it for an hour, then spit it out; and this is the method of cauterization.
And cauterize any extremity you can, as is possible for you.
And this is the method of the cannula:
Chapter 22.
Of cauterization of extrophulos.
When extrophulos are caused by phlegm and cold humors and are not responsive to digestion through medicines, and you desire to ease their digestion, then you ignite the cautery, whose shape is as follows: having two open ends so that smoke may escape from the cautery from the other end.  Place this ignited cautery on that abscess once, and again if needed, until you reach the base of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it in place for three days, and put on it a cloth soaked in water until what the fire has burned is healed.
And then treat it with ointment, bandages, and dressings until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
Of cauterization of hoarseness of voice and constriction of the throat.
When moisture gathers in the lung's passages, especially when this is due to a cold constitution, the patient should initially be treated with laxative medicines, and then cauterized near the root of the windpipe, in the affected area.
And be careful not to cauterize too close to the windpipe or burn the surrounding tissue, but only a little.
And cauterize the area with another cautery near the joint of the neck, behind the spine. And the cautery should be sharp, following the previous method.
And then treat it with what has been previously prescribed until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
Of cauterization of lung ailments and coughs.
When coughs and lung ailments are caused by cold moisture, and the patient has neither fever nor consumption, and the illness is longstanding, then cauterize the area with two cauteries above the furcula in the depressed, distant, and protruding locations; and with another cautery in the middle area of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be sharp, according to the previous method.
And if you wish, your cauterization can be puncture-like with the cautery called *puncta*, the method for which is described in the section on earache treatment.
And let there be punctures within those areas; and then treat it with the same remedies as previously described until healed.
And let the cautery have three points, for cauterization is with it:  with one application, you can make three cauteries in this manner:
Chapter 25.
Of cauterization of the tic douloureux, which is the head of the ailment.
When the head of the ailment (tic douloureux) is displaced due to lubricating humidity and is not held firm at the time of its return from its displacement until it settles, and then, by a slight movement, it is displaced again, as we have witnessed, then it is necessary to first reduce the displacement, and then turn the patient on their back or side; and then elevate the tendon that is in the internal part of the tic douloureux to the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated in the internal parts.
And then heat the cautery, having two points; and this is its form:
And then cauterize the tendon until it penetrates the other side; and the figure of cauterization will then be of four points cauterized.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count, and therefore the cauteries are eight.
And then place a poultice of cooked salt over the cautery, and then make the patient rest, and the limb should not be moved for a time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done, then cauterize the muscle with a wedge-shaped or pointed cautery, for the joint is strengthened and the moisture is removed and the patient is cured.
Chapter 26.
Of cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and excessive moisture enter the stomach, disrupting its constitution and multiplying there, and if you continue treatment methods and do not succeed, then the patient should lie on their back, extend their arms and legs, and then cauterize it with three cauteries: one below the foot for the space of a finger with a wedge-shaped cautery, and two more below the sides of the first, until a triangular cautery shape is formed; and separate those that are not joined, to create a space/separation.
And if the depth of the cautery is the amount of two-thirds the thickness of a cord/rope.
And let the shape of the cautery be according to this form without additions. And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and this should be a cautery in the shape of a circle according to this form:
And cauterize the stomach by puncturing it, where this cautery has caused fright/pain:  and you should mark the stomach with a point according to the desired amount with a probe, and then cauterize that spot with a cautery; and then treat it with the previous treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
Of the cauterization of a cold/chilled liver.
When pain in the liver arises from cold, humidity, or excessive windiness, until its normal state is restored by the expulsion of excess, and the illness is treated as we have said and not otherwise, then the patient should be placed on their back, and mark three cauteries according to this shape and this same size, over the liver below the ribs, in the area where a person lies on their back.
And the space between each cautery should be the width of a finger, and the cauteries should be aligned with the length of the patient's right body.
And do not press too hard with the cautery.
And if the amount of what is cauterized is the size of half a fingertip, and no more should be added; and if the patient is standing on their feet; and if not standing, then lying down, with their legs extended, and raise their arms.
And you are able to cauterize these areas with a knife cautery, when you have the subtlety and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to overdo the cauterization, and let only the tip of a finger be burned, lest the entire body and the bowels be injured, for the skin here is delicate; and know this.
Chapter 28.
Of the puncturing of a liver abscess with a cautery.
When there is an inflammation or abscess in the liver and you wish to know if that abscess is in the liver tissue itself or in its covering, then if it is in the liver tissue itself, the patient experiences considerable weight and sharp pain.
And if it is in the liver's covering, the pain is sharp and often exhausting for doctors to treat.
Therefore, the patient should be turned on their side; then, locate the abscess with a probe; and then apply the cautery, which is shaped like a pointed rod, the shape of which is shown on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until all the pus is consumed, until it reaches the cyst, until it bleeds out/scabs over.
And then treat that area as part of the treatment for the other abscesses until it is healed.
And only use this type of cautery if its use in the art of medicine is well-established, and many illnesses have been cured by it; however, sometimes, some physicians might be bold in applying it to this operation, but nevertheless, we leave that up to them, and it's better [to proceed more cautiously].
Chapter 29.
On the cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancient authorities on the roots of astrology said that cauterization of cold pleurisy using this method is effective.  You should take a long, dry root from the roots of astrology—a long, pointed root, the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil and heat it in the fire, and then cauterize with a cautery at the place between the continuation of the collarbone (furcula) and the neck; and with two small cauteries, guiding them slightly downward towards the area under the chin; and with two cauteries on the area sloping downward between the 5th and 6th ribs, angling them slightly towards the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the foot; and another on the stomach; and with three cauteries on the back areas; and one cautery in the place between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries on the two sides of the foot, positioned below the cautery between the shoulder blades.
And it is not necessary to hold your hand with the cautery, but rather it should be held (or operated) clearly with the cord/handle (or instrument).
And some ancient authorities say that some people use an iron cautery shaped like a ray, and heat it up, and place it on the area between the ribs, until they reach the abscess and it is drained of pus, as we have described in the case of a liver abscess.
But this cautery perforation is not without risk, for it quickly causes an accident at the fistula site where healing is not possible.
Chapter 30.
Of the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat spleen disease using the methods previously described for treatment of the spleen (or its division) and your treatment isn't effective, you can cauterize the area in three ways, all of which are appropriate:  one is to make three or four cauterizations in a line along the length of the spleen, following the shape of the cauterizations used for the liver, which have been described previously.
And let the distance between each cauterization be the width of a finger or a little more, and the manner of the cauterization be the same as the one we described for the cauterization of the liver.
And do not press your hand onto the cauterizing instrument; and let the patient lie flat on their back.
And there is another way to cauterize, which is to ignite the cautery using two fluids, a method discussed in the chapter on muscle dislocation, and lift the rib cage located on the side of the spleen where the patient's left side rests.
And your lifting should be along the length of the body, so that the cauterizations are made across the width of the body.
Then, insert the two fluids, ignited strongly, into that space, so that with these fluids, you penetrate the ribs on the other side.
And then remove the cautery; and thus four cauteries have been made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery using three fluids.
And then you treat the cautery, once it has stopped emitting sparks for too many days, for it is more important than the other previous things in the treatment.
Chapter 31.
Of the cauterization of dropsy.
Cautery is not used in dropsy, but rather in a specific type of swelling.
When you treat the dropsy using the methods of treatment we have discussed in the division, and your treatment does not succeed, then it is necessary to cauterize with four cauteries around the navel, and with one cautery on the stomach, and another cautery on the liver, and another cautery on the spleen, and with two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, and one cautery on the right foot, and another cautery on the stomach. And the depth of the cautery should be proportionate to the severity of the condition.
And then leave the cautery open so that it drains for a long time.
And do not evacuate the patient of the treatment near the cautery with what is needed, for by doing so, two intentions are added to it, and the healing will be hastened by the aid of sanation.
The shape of the cautery used to cauterize the belly should be wedge-shaped, similar to the previous one described, and the one used for the back should be olive-shaped, similar in form to the previous one.
Chapter 32.
On cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are affected by dropsy and filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the sole of the foot, in the area between the auricular and annular bones, and elevate your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; and then elevate your hand, and do not completely return it, because the yellow water will flow back.
The cautery should be shaped like this:  Then make two cauteries on the two thighs, and on each thigh a cautery should be made with the blade-like end of the cautery. And the cautery should be along the length of the thigh: one below the knee and the other below the middle of the thigh; and two cauteries on each thigh.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that any remaining water drains from it.
And then treat it with the methods we have described.
Chapter 33.
Concerning cauterization of the abdomen.
When the abdomen is affected by cold and dampness, weakening the digestive and retentive powers, located in the stomach and intestines, this is treated with the methods of healing and not with confections.  And sometimes the patient will endure cauterization, exhibiting improvement; then cauterize that area with a large cautery on their stomach, as previously described in cauterization of the stomach, using a circular cautery and four subtle cauteries in the navel's surrounding area, with a fine, nail-shaped cautery; and with a cautery on the lower abdomen, large or with two cauteries.
And if the excess humidity is noticeable and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize the area on the groin and intestines, using two cauteries placed firmly close to the stomach and near the groin, because this is a complete cure and a helpful treatment of which you will not err.
Chapter 34.
Concerning the cauterization of old hemorrhoids.
When old hemorrhoids are caused by thick, cold humors or corrupt moisture, and treatments described earlier in the division have not been effective, then cauterize with three cauteries on the pus beneath the coccyx, one small, one small triangle-shaped, and one cautery above the navel, placed two fingers apart.
And if you fear that the patient's stomach is chilled, their food is not being digested, and their face is often inflamed, then cauterize on the stomach with a large cautery, as previously described; and with one cautery on the liver, and another on the spleen, using a nail-shaped cautery. Leave the cautery open for a while, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Of cauterization of a boil near the incision of it.
When you incise a boil, then you ignite the cautery that is shaped like a ray. Then, place that ignited cautery into the incised boil, and continue until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood comes.
And do this once or twice; for if the boils are numerous, then cauterize each one of them as we have described, and then treat them with the ointments you give them until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery over an area, it is more harmful than helpful.
Chapter 36.
Of the cauterization of fistulas that are made by nature in the diseased parts.
When nature does not obey the treatment we have described for the affected area, and the patient is alarmed by this, it should be treated with cauterization.
Therefore, when someone has a fistula in a natural cavity, and it is old, with running sores and corrupted moisture, then the best course of action is to probe it with a thin probe, and then determine the depth of the fistula with the aforementioned probe.
Then heat the cautery iron, which should be similar to a ray. And then place that heated cautery iron into this fistula, according to the depth indicated by the probe.
And repeat the application of the cautery until those corrupted tissues are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to your need.
And be careful not to burn the nerves and veins; or if the fistula goes towards the bladder or towards the intestine, then be careful of all those areas; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy area and you think it is not penetrating.
And then treat the area until it is healed.
And if the area is sealed, and the matter has been removed from it, and it remains like this for a long time, then know that it is completely healed.
And if the matter has not been removed from it, then know that it is penetrating or in the vicinity of rotten flesh, or that it is caused by conditions that will return to that area.
Chapter 37.
Of cauterization of the kidneys.
When the kidneys are pained by cold or excessive windiness, and this causes the patient's lower back to be inflamed, then it is necessary to cauterize the area around the kidneys with a cautery iron on each kidney.  A pointed cautery iron should be used, from which the pain may return.
And cauterize lightly with the second one a little lower, so that there will be three lines of cauterizations, and thus they will be more effective in bringing relief.
Chapter 38.
Of cauterization of the bladder.
When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and moisture, such that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize the area just below the bladder, where the pubic hairs begin, and cauterize with one cautery iron on the right side and another on the left.
And the length of each cautery should be in accordance with the size of the pain; and cauterize that area with one cautery iron on the lowest part of the pain, or with two if necessary.
And let the cautery iron be pointed as the procedure dictates.
Chapter 39.
Of cauterization of the mother (or womb).
When cold and dampness enter the womb, and because of this, pregnancy is prohibited, and the menstruation is corrupted, and the expulsion of it is delayed, and pain occurs before the expulsion, then the area should be cauterized with three cautery irons in a circle around the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; and with one cautery iron on the lowest part of the area, or with two cautery irons, and let the cautery iron be pointed.
Chapter 40.
Of cauterization of a dislocated ankle.
When mucous dampness is diffused to the ankle area, and it causes the joint to become displaced, and a sign of this is that one joint is extended over the other when compared. And the location of the dislocation is found where it bulges.
Then it is necessary to cauterize the patient's ankle area with a circular cautery, after you have marked the area with a probe in the shape of a circle, so that the affected area falls into the center of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the form used previously in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available, then cauterize it with three large olive-shaped cauteries.
And let the cautery be performed according to the severity of the entire condition; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
Concerning the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain occurs in the area of the loins, and it is caused by cold and moisture, if the illness is cured by what we have already said and is not successful, then you should remove the illness of thick humors with foul-smelling or artificial pills, or similar; and then cauterize it.
And the method of cauterization in that case is in two ways: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
There are two known methods.  One is to cauterize that area on his/her loins with three triangular cauteries in this form; and make a good depth with them. And let the spaces between each cautery be the width of a finger, whether the cautery is small or large.
But sometimes the cautery is placed on the middle of the area over the loins, which makes for four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with a circle, as the form precedes in cauterizing a dislocation of the loin,  so that the circle encompasses and burns the entirety of the affected area.
And this is the method of cauterization for sciatica when the pain is confined to the loin and has not spread to the thigh.
However, if the pain has spread to the thigh, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the thigh, over the area where the patient feels the pain; and with one cautery on the shin, approximately four finger-widths from the outer side.
And if the cautery is with a knife, the depth of the cautery should be according to the extent of the affected area.
And if the patient feels the pain has spread to the area near the toes, then cauterize there with the cautery, with three or four points, or more if needed.
And if the patient feels pain below the knee, near the thigh, then cauterize that spot with a knife cautery.
And be careful in all cauterizations that you do not burn the nerve or large artery, lest you cause harm or contraction to the patient.
And I have seen others who cauterized near the ankle and, in the cauterization, the leg became inflamed until the swelling reached the foot, and the foot was perforated and corrupted. And then a severe bowel issue, and after that, death.
And if the pain is in two places simultaneously, cauterize each one according to this method.
And some wise men say, in the cauterization of a certain area, this is the method: make a circle of iron, whose circumference is half a palm; and let it be near its orifice, according to the thickness of a date stone or a little less.
And within that circle, let there be another one-third; and let the space between them be the size of a lentil; and let these circles be open in two parts; and let the length of these pieces be one or two lentils, and make in these iron pieces decent and appropriate shaping around the circles; and this is the shape of it:
Then heat it in the fire until it glows red and throws sparks, and then place it on the affected area, the patient lying on their side. And therefore cauterize that with three round cauteries at once.
And then leave it for three days; then plaster it with butter and leave the wound open for several days; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Says Albucasis:  O, children, of this type of cautery we have used little due to the fear of its appearance, and because few have been found who look after it.
But of the good cauteries, for those who endure it, and find with it the location of the problem.
But cauterization with adhering medicines is what you should do: make two circles using a perforated instrument in which the iron door's hinge is placed; let the length of the wall, in its height, be two nuts or wedges.
And if the spaces between each are the thickness of a finger; and be open underneath and above, and let them contain themselves between each other in this shape:
Then place the sick person on their healthy side, and place your hand on the afflicted area of the hip; and then take hot water and place it between the two circles, and let it be heated slowly by a small fire.  Keep it in place for approximately one hour, and let the patient endure the burning and scorching,  — for that produces a burning sensation like fire — until the burning sensation ceases.
And then lift your hand with the instrument and remove the hot water from the entire hip area with fresh water.
And then leave it for three days and apply a poultice until the black discoloration from the burning is gone.  Leave it for several days, and expect some discomfort. This is the final treatment.
And then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends into the thigh or leg, apply a similar treatment there as was done to the hip.
And this is the method of hot water treatment, and I have already written about it in my treatise on the correction of medicine. Take a portion of lye and a portion of quicklime, each one part, and pulverize them. Place them in a new, unglazed pot whose bottom has a small hole, proportional to the patient's wound.
Place another, glazed pot beneath the bottom of the first pot.  Pour some fresh water over the lye and quicklime within the first pot, adding it drop by drop.  Then, using your hand, thoroughly compress the mixture. Allow the heated water from the first pot to drip down into the glazed pot below.
Then collect all that water and pour it over fresh quicklime and lye.  This will now have a very potent heat, which is used in many medical procedures and cauterizations of other body parts; for it acts like fire.
And some of the medicines used for cauterization include sulfur, honey, and quicklime, mixed together in such a way.
And Galen, recounting an ancient physician's method, described the treatment for pain in the back and sciatica, praising its effectiveness highly, saying it required no further treatment.  He claimed it was cured in one application, as described, because the afflicted person would easily feel relief while immersed in a bath.
And it is to be taken from fresh green herbs, or if no green ones are found, fresh fig leaves are to be taken; and they should be finely crushed with a little bit of gravel and placed on the back, thigh, or leg where the pain is, then bound on.
And it should be left on for three hours, or for however long the patient feels the burn subsides.
And then place the patient in a bath; and when their body is warmed through, have them lie down on the ground, for the pain will cease and they will be healed.
And know that one should not use cautery with these remedies except after the body has been purged.
However, Esquirides says that when a vein is cauterized with a goat's hoof, it is very beneficial; and the cautery should be done in this way: take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it between the foot's pits and its tendons.
Then take a dry goat's hoof, and burn it in fire until it is charred; and then place it on the wool and leave it there until it is spread out. And repeat this, and do not stop doing this until the feeling of the bite reaches the inside and the pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called cautery of goats.
Chapter 42.
Of cauterization for pain of the two (or "a double pain").
Sometimes pain in the back arises from various causes, such as blows or falls or excessive evacuation, and similar causes, due to the infusion of cold, damp matter.
And cautery is only effective in this single type of pain, which is caused by the effusion of cold matter.
Therefore, it is necessary, first to evacuate the patient with pills and similar remedies, then make three lines of cauteries along the length of the affected area in the back, where the pain is, placing 5 or more cauteries on each line, according to the patient's tolerance and the power of the cauteries.
And the cauterization should be performed with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, using a medial wedge-shaped cautery, according to this method:
Chapter 43.
On cauterization at the beginning of a swelling.
Often this illness strikes young children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that it causes stiffness in their limbs, and impairs their lifting and movement.
And you find that the last vertebra of the back and the bones of the buttocks are beginning to rise above the other vertebrae.
And therefore, when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular in this shape: that takes the cautery over the entire part of the vertebra equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery two or three lines. And let the points be close together.
And then treat the area until it is healed with what we have said.
But be careful that the cautery is not applied to a swelling caused by nerve spasms.
Chapter XLIV.
Of the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that spread to each part of the body, and pain comes in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And thus, if gout caused by cold is treated with medicinal remedies and the pain persists, then remove it with cauterization.
And you cauterize the area around the joint of the foot with small cauteries, targeting the affected area.
And let the cautery be olive oil, of which this is the form of it:
And if it is necessary to make punctures on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And if the pain spreads to the knees or other joints, which often happens, then cauterize each knee with three or four cauteries from all sides using this olive oil cautery.
And if many cauteries are needed, then cauterize the area, but do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery beforehand.  Only apply it around the affected skin area.
And if the pain reaches the first and second knee, then administer the cautery as described in its chapter.
And if the pain is only in the hands, and it is called "suagra," then puncture around the joints in the manner of a spiral, puncturing along those two lines.
And if pain remains in the said areas, then puncture in the circuit of the joints above each knuckle and on the palm of the hand.
And if the pain spreads to the knees or muscles over several days, then cauterize each of them from all sides with the help/assistance (literally "from all parts of the help").
And do not neglect the patient's good regimen and the reception of medicines, for if a good regimen is followed and the bad humors are evacuated with this cautery, the patient will be healed, God willing.
Chapter 45.
Of cauterization of ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestines are protruding in front of the hernia at the groin, and this is beginning to happen, then it is necessary that you order the patient to refrain from eating on that day and to use soothing remedies so that the tear/rupture subsides from its source/belly.
And then, support the patient between your hands on their belly, and instruct them to hold still until the hernia or intestines are fully extruded.
And then, gently return it with your fingers and apply a bandage to the rupture over the hip bone, using a bandage the end of which is shaped like a half-circle, like the upper parts of the body.
And then, apply the cautery, whose shape is like this:
until it is very red and emits sparks. And then, return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and then place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, and placed a cushion beneath them, and another servant is on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
Then place the cautery on that mark with your hand, holding the cautery steady, and hold it there until you can reach the bone of the ankle (or shinbone) to the middle of the foot; and repeat this again if you did not reach the bone the first time.
And carefully observe the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn the intestine, lest it cause death or other great harm to the patient.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your procedure is not complete.
And the cautery for children should be subtle, according to their size and proportion.
And then treat the cauterized area for three days with a dressing until the scar from the fire is gone.
And then treat it with other ointments until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for 40 days until the area and the wound are sealed.
And you must regulate their diet according to the duration of their treatment, which should avoid straining the abdomen and prevent the intestines from protruding further during recovery.
And then, when approximately 40 days have passed, administer a properly made bandage, and keep it on for another 40 days.
And he should abstain from strenuous work, overeating, and excessive drinking, and loud noises, for if he follows this regimen of treatment, he will be fully healed.
And I will now describe the treatment of ruptures in other parts of the abdomen.  If, at the outset, you want to prevent them from protruding, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery, in proportion to its size, and make it as dry as a third part of itself.  Then treat it with what we have already said, and that is sufficient.
And some earlier practitioners might say that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape, since it is identified with a probe.
And a line is drawn across it, on the widest part of the rupture, and another line above it; and you press down with a wedge-shaped cautery, but the first, simpler cautery is better.
Chapter 46.
Of the cauterization of twisting (or torsion).
When, in some limb, pain arises due to a blow or impact, and that pain persists for a long time, and you find no cure with medicines, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And the cautery should be applied to each limb according to its size and smallness, its strength and weakness, the location of the twisting, and the pain in it.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cauterization, good.  But if not, then repeat the cauterization; for it is the custom of those pains to be punctured from one limb to another limb near it, so it is necessary to apply cautery repeatedly until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
Of cauterization for leprosy.
Some forms of leprosy are greatly helped by cautery, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And therefore, when you wish to cauterize this, consider if the leprosy is superficial and can be cured with what we have said in the division, and not this one.  If you fear the corruption might spread throughout the patient's body and constitution, then cauterize on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, another below that, between the forehead and the hairline; and two on the temples/ear regions; and one at the back of the neck or nape of the neck.
Finally, press the cautery slightly into the bone until a small indentation is made, so that the expulsion of thick vapors is alleviated; and cauterize over the spleen as needed.
And if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and is clearly visible, then you must cauterize with the cauteries described for the head; and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on each cheekbone, and two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the vertebrae near the hip, and one on the hip, and two on the shoulders, and one on each shoulder, and two on the elbows and one on each elbow, and two on the knees, and two on the thighs, and two on the lower leg muscles, and two on the joints of the toes of each foot; and cauterize on all the joints of the fingers and toes, and on each heel of the feet, and on the armpits of the arms.
Be careful of the nerves that are on the heel so you do not burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with one cautery on the pelvic bone, and another on the opening of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you apply, the more helpful and beneficial it is; and know that the patient feels no pain from the cautery, just as they don't from incisions, because the body is already numb.
And the cauteries should be large or small according to the limbs and joints, as is prescribed by the types of tools.
And then treat the cautery with flour of barley cooked with honey and with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Concerning the cauterization of numbness.
When a limb is numb or asleep and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then you cauterize that numb limb with cauteries according to the size of the limb.
And let your cautery enter the flesh slightly. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes numbness, which affects the hands and feet, and the vertebrae of the back and the nerves that serve that limb, is cauterized, and the numbness is removed.
However, do not presume upon this unless you are knowledgeable about the anatomy of the limbs and the distribution of the nerves throughout the entire moving body.
Chapter 49.
Of the cauterization of albaras, which is morphea.
When albaras is old and you cannot cure it with any medicinal ointments, then cauterize over it with a cautery, applying a little heat according to the severity of the disease until the whiteness and color of it are removed, and its color is changed.
And then treat it with flour of barley and lentils, mixed with roasted olive oil and arnica leaves, and with a portion of pigeon blood or swallow blood; all mixed together.  A cloth should be soaked and placed over the affected area until healed.
Chapter 50.
Of cauterization of cancer.
When cancer is starting and you want to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, in the same way as it is rolled out (or in the same way it is spread out).
And the learned ones say it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle; but I have not seen that done, because I fear that it will be ulcerated, and I have seen that happen several times.
And it is better to cauterize it in a circle around it as we said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the cauterization of malignant growths.
When a malignant growth is slow to mature, and this is due to excess of the [malignant] matter, or the age of the patient, because they are old and frail, with little blood, or due to time, and you want to hasten the maturation of the growth; then cauterize in a circle around it with many small, puncturing cauteries; and then leave it, for it will speed up its maturation.
But if you want to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, of which this is the form: and place it in the middle of the growth until it penetrates the skin.
And if the cautery is in the lower location, so that the arm's condition is relieved; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
Concerning the cauterization of corrosive sores/ulcers.
A corrosive ulcer is a wandering corruption in the limb, which corrodes it just as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore, if this corrosive ulcer is in a location suitable for cauterization with fire, then you use cauterizing irons, small ones in small areas and larger ones as appropriate to the location of the ulcer.
And then cauterize it from all sides until you eradicate the entire ulcer and no trace of it remains.
And then leave it for three days, and apply dressings soaked in mixed oil to the cauterized areas until the scabs are all gone and all corruption is eradicated.
And then treat it with a flesh-generating ointment.
But if after three days, healthy flesh has grown where there is no corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cauterization on the remaining corrupted areas.
And sometimes a corrosive medicine is used, as it serves in place of cautery. But however, cautery with fire is a more speedy remedy.
And I have already described the treatment with a sharp medicine in the division, so take it when you need it.
Chapter 53.
Of cauterization of ulcers and other similar afflictions.
Many times there are ailments called ulcers beneath the sick foot, which are large, jagged sores, hurting the foot.  Cauterization for them is done in two ways: with fire and with hot water.
But cauterization with fire involves heating a concave cautery, similar to a small crucible, made of iron, fitting the size of the ulcer in all directions, and with fine edges.
Then place that heated cautery on the ulcer, and rotate your hand with the cautery around the ulcer until the cautery reaches the depth of the ulcer. And leave it for three days until it begins to discharge pus. Then apply a poultice of crushed wild mallows with salt, and leave the poultice on it for one night, for that will eradicate it from its roots.
And then treat the area with a healing ointment until it is healed.
And if this doesn't work, and this often happens on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then you must administer cauterization with water. Take a cannula of bronze, iron, or a hawk's feather, and place it on the ulcer.  Pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula, and hold your hand over it.  Rotate the cannula with pressure from your hand all around, ensuring the cannula's edge is pressed into the root of the ulcer.  The hot water will reach the base of the ulcer.  Allow the patient to endure the effect of the hot water for about an hour, and then remove it.  The ulcer and its roots will be eradicated.
And do this with those and then the other until all those that are of their kind are on the body.
And then treat those pus-filled sores since the roots of the ulcers are eradicated, with ointments that generate new flesh.
Chapter 44.
Of the cauterization of tremor.
When someone has a tremor caused by cold in the nerves, or by a cold-induced fever, or by another similar cause, then you should cauterize it with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, one cautery between each vertebra; and with a cautery on their foot, and on their stomach, with an olive-shaped cautery.
And the tremor of the patient subsides, hastening the recovery from the cold illness.
Chapter 45.
Of cauterization of white blemishes on the body.
When white spots and pustules, which are caused by thick, corrupted matter, appear on the body, it is necessary, at the beginning, when they are evident, that the head of each fistula be cauterized with a fine cautery made from myrtle wood, the end of which is heated; or with long root of erestology; or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
And sometimes, at the beginning of their expulsion, a cautery is applied in this manner; and if they do not yield, the excess is broken up, and the afflicted body heals.
However, this must be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
Chapter LVI.
Concerning the cauterization of accidental blood flow by arrow-shaped incisions.
Many times, an arrow wound is incised towards the wound itself, which then protrudes, or towards the incision of an abscess or cauterization of the limb, and similar cases, and it is difficult to heal that.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then you press with your hand against the opening of the arrow wound, and place your index finger over it, pressing repeatedly until the flow of blood under your finger is stopped, and it does not come out.
And then place the small and large olive-shaped cauteries, in some quantity, in the fire, and blow on them until they are very hot.
And then, take one of those, small or large depending on the location and wound where the artery is broken, onto that vein quickly, after you have removed your finger, and hold the cautery until the blood is cauterized and tightened.
And if the blood is expelled from the artery opening when you remove your finger and apply the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from the cauteries that are prepared in the fire, and thus continue to do this one after another until the blood is constricted.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is here, and that another harm comes to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to constrict the blood, especially when the artery is large, unless by one of four methods: either with a cautery as we have said, or by extraction if it is not already extracted, for when it is extracted, the extremities of the patient are often burned and the blood is constricted, or that it is tied with thread or a bandage by a strong constriction, or that medicines whose virtue is to constrict the blood are placed upon it, and are strengthened by a cushion with suitable compression.
However, the one who administers a proper constriction by means of a bandage and constriction with cloths or by applying burning substances and similar, does not achieve it quickly.
But if this happens to someone and the physician is not present, nor is medicine available, then, using gentle pressure of the index finger on the opening of the vein as we have said, proceed to strongly compress it until the blood is stopped from its outward flow, and the finger should not be removed from the artery; and above the artery, it should be sprinkled with very cold water until the blood is congealed and thickened;  and further action, whether with cautery or medicine, is necessary.
Of incisions and perforations, leeches, phlebotomy, sores, and similar afflictions.
We have already discussed in the first chapter all illnesses for which cauterization with fire and comburent medicines are appropriate, along with the occasions and causes for them, and the necessary instruments with the forms of the cauteries; and I have organized the chapters from the head down to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the seeker of this knowledge will be relieved, concerning whatever they have inquired about.
And before I begin this, children, it is necessary to understand that in this chapter, the content is related to the first chapter on cauterization.
And for this reason, great care is required, because in the operations of this chapter, many times, the evacuation necessary for life is achieved through bloodletting, be it by incision of a vein, or an incision on an abscess or an opening for discharge, or the removal of a foreign object, or extracting a dart, or the incision of a stone, and similar procedures. And all of those are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in the hands of those who do them lies death.
And I warn you that this should not happen to you, for sometimes you will encounter men with many kinds of illnesses. And some of them will become enraged by their illness, and death is near for them, due to the severity of their illness, and the length of their suffering, and with the illness comes fear, which signifies death.
And of those is the one who gives you their belongings and says, "You are hoping for health," and their illness is harmful.
Therefore, you should not agree to the one who comes to you in this manner; let your caution be greater than your desire and your recklessness.  Do not presume any cause upon this, but only with certain knowledge which verifies this to you, and with which comes a praiseworthy outcome.
Practice in the treatment of all your patients with prognosis and indication to that which is converted to health, for in that is help for you in gaining fame and memory, praise and glory.
Oh, children, may God inspire your understanding and do not deprive yourselves of his guidance and protection, for this is in his power.
And I have organized this chapter, distinguishing it by sections, as was previously done in the chapter on cauteries, concerning the treatment from the head to the feet, so that this will alleviate what you seek and of which you have need.
First Chapter.
Of the treatment of water contained in the heads of children.
Know that this ailment often affects children around the time of birth, and when the nurse tightens the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it occurs due to a hidden cause that is unknown.
However, I have only seen this illness in children; and all those I saw it in died, and thus I am convinced it is a hopeless case in such patients.
And I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was constantly swelling until he could no longer support himself because of the size of his head, and that the moisture continued to increase until he died.
And this moisture is either accumulated between the skull and the bone, or accumulated beneath the bone on the spinal column.
When the treatment for this condition, where the moisture is between the skull and the bone and the abscess is small, you should make an incision in the middle of the head,  a slit whose length is about two inches, until the moisture flows out.  This is the method of treatment for this condition (or, this is the form of the operation).
And therefore, if the moisture is more extensive and the abscess larger, then there are two incisions in this manner:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, a sign of this is that you see the seams of the skull open on all sides, and the water is squeezed out when you press on it with your hand in various places, and this is not hidden from you. You should make an incision in the middle of the head using three slits in this manner:
Then remove all the moisture from the incision; then tighten the slits with cloths and dressings; then apply wine and oil to it until the fifth day, and then loosen the bandage and treat the wound with dressings and ointments, and support the head evenly; and the patient should eat dry foods with low moisture content until the affected area is strengthened and healed.
And there is another method of incision, where you consider the size of the abscess and the collection of water, for sometimes it is more in the back of the head, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore, make the incision where the abscess and the collection of water appear, and do it in the way that seems best to you.
And be careful not to cut the artery, lest blood flow out and the patient die from that blood loss and the evacuation of moisture.
Second chapter.
When there is persistent catarrh or inflammation in the eyes or foot, and the usual medicines are not effective, then the final treatment in this case is the incision of those two arteries.
And therefore, when you want to incise those, if the patient is holding their head, rub the area with a rough cloth to expose the arteries, then tie the patient's head with a cloth; then consider where the vein pulses; and mark the spots on each side near the ears, because they are hidden in some people.
And then mark the artery with a probe, and then cut each one with a sharp incision, penetrating the bone, and do so at the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the probe under the artery and sever it at the points above.
And the length of the incision should be about two fingers wide, for when any vein is cut, the blood flows out with a pulsating exit, which jumps out frequently.
But if the artery is not visible, then you should measure from the ear the distance of three fingers, and then mark it with a probe and cut to the bone.
And the amount of blood that needs to be drawn is about one ounce, and the amount may vary more or less, and all this depends on the strength of the patient and the fullness of their artery.
And then consider the wound, and if any cause of inflammation remains on the bone, then cut that out so that a hot abscess does not develop.
And then bind the wound with bandages and linen strips, and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Of the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
When, in some cases, you encounter chronic migraines or severe headaches, caused by irritating moisture and by the quality of inflammation in the temples, or a sudden severe pain resembling these, and treatment with the established methods of medicine is not effective, then we have proven effective in such ailments the extraction of arteries in the temples, or cauterization of those as described previously.
And the method of the operation and extraction of those arteries is that the patient shaves the hair which is on the temples; and notice the artery appearing in the temple as it is shown to you by its pulse, and it is hidden except to a few people because of the violence of the cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then the patient's neck should be tightened with some cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or apply hot water to the area until the artery appears clearly to you. And then you take the instrument, which has this shape: And then you carefully slice the skin with that instrument until you reach the artery; and then you apply cautery to the area and extract that artery in a systematic way until you pull it free from the surrounding tissues and expose those beneath it, from all sides.
But if the artery is thin, then wrap it with the tip of the cautery, and then cut off a portion according to the extent to which its ends are lengthened and drawn together, so that there will be no blood flow; for if it is not severed, the blood will not fully recede.
And then drain the blood from a vein one to three times.
And if the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with strong double-stitched silk or long cords, and do not cut it until the wound has healed and blood flow ceases.
And then you cut away the excess tissue that lies between two ligaments; and do this at that time or at another time.
And if you wish, cauterize that with a cautery, even to the bone, with a scalpel cautery, until its ends are cut, and the same action will take place there.
And it is a better course of action if the patient does not have a fever or is not of a hot temperament; for cauterization is one of those things that helps to remove moisture, and thus it is better for curing.
And it is necessary, after removing the arteries, that the area be filled with old lint and be sprinkled with properly prepared powders, and then be treated with drying medicines that promote flesh growth, and with poultices until it heals.
And if, while working, there is a further flow of blood from the artery, then you must try to stop that blood, either with a cautery, or by filling the area with lint, and pressing your hand until the blood is stopped. And if none of those things is at hand, then place your finger on the area until the blood is congealed, and apply water of great coldness to the area until the pain subsides, and it is constricted as needed.
And the easiest way to remove an artery is to cauterize the vein with this cautery, having two blades, after marking the two spots with a probe, and making each one extremely hot, until they reach the bone and cut the vein in two places, so that what is between the ends of it is stretched, because they are not completely consolidated by this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And the sharpness of the two blades is important. However, if the sharpness is less than that of two blades, it is better, for if it is sharp like two blades close to each other, it will not cut the flesh quickly.
Therefore, since there is some thickness in those [blades], the heat of the fire is maintained in them, and the flesh is cut easily.
And this method is better than any other method and is more convenient.
And the space between the two blades should be the width of a finger.
Fourth Chapter.
Of the treatment of bodies afflicted with acute and acrid humors in the eyes.
When the eyes are acrid, and the vessels beneath the scalp become inflamed, and you find no medicinal cause for their treatment, and sometimes the patient's face begins to redden, and they feel a crawling sensation on their forehead as if ants were crawling, and the eyes are weakened, moist, to the point that their skin is blurred, and the eyelids are burning due to the sharpness of the tears,  ancient healers faced difficulties in treating these cases and often called upon a variety of procedures.
And you instruct the patient to shave the hair on their forehead, and then make three equally spaced incisions across the forehead, following its length. And if the incision is two fingers long: one incision should be centered on the forehead, directly above the bridge of the nose; the second should be positioned slightly along the length of the space between the eyes; the third at the other end of the forehead.
And be careful not to cut the arteries which are located on both sides, and keep your hand away from continuing the incision through both jaws. And if the space between each incision is the width of three fingers.
And if you have a piece of prepared sponge or very dry cloths with which to soak up the blood.
And then insert the spatula with two sharp ends, of which this is the shape of the incision: which is from the temple area up to the second incision. Scrape with that the entire membrane which is between the two incisions with the chisel that is over the bone, and then do this from the middle incision up to the second incision. And then remove this spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a knife, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And place the blade of that sharp part against the flesh adjacent to the membrane, and its handle against the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle fissure, and cut with that all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But let the incision continue in this way on the membrane, and then do this in the middle fissure until the other fissure.
And since a quantity of congealed blood flows, express the places of the congealed blood clots.
And then place in each fissure a piece of old cloth, and put on those powders mixed with wine, oil, and sour wine, and make sure that no hot abscess develops.
And on the third day, loosen the ligament and administer a large infusion of warm or lukewarm water, and then treat it with basil ointment with rubbed oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
Concerning the treatment of sores and descending ulcers in the parts within the head.
When a person experiences sharp and persistent sores, and the patient's ulcers are small and spreading, and the healing of them is weakened, and the eyelids are ulcerated and the skin around them is affected, and there is a sharp and debilitating pain in the scalp area, then know from these symptoms that the sores and ulcers come from a multitude of veins in the parts of the head itself.
And the best treatment in these cases is this: order the patient to shave their forehead, and then make a small incision in the middle of the forehead (starting with an incision from the left temple to the right temple; and the incision should go down to the bone; and carefully move your hand away from the temporal lacerations, which are likely to cause further problems during chewing), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth, and then fill the gap between the two edges of the incision with old cloth or linen. And then apply a poultice made of powders mixed with wine and oil, to prevent a painful abscess from forming.
And when you remove this and see that the abscess has begun to diminish, then you must clean the bone until flesh begins to grow, and then treat it with a drying regimen that encourages flesh growth, just as if you take two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony and mix them, making a plaster from this, which should be applied to these wounds to promote the growth of new flesh.
Chapter 6.
Of the treatment of that which affects the ears.
Every ailment affecting the ears belongs to one of four categories: either a mineral, or something resembling a mineral, such as iron or glass; or a plant, such as a thorn or bean; or a fluid substance, such as water, sour wine, and similar liquids; or an animal.
And therefore, when a stone or a similar substance that doesn't adhere or grow in the ear is lodged there, and you expose the ear to the sun, and if you can dislodge the stone, then instill into it some kind of violet or cedar oil, and then remove it, and make the person sneeze with some remedy, and block the nostrils to support the sneezing action. And then place some cloths or wool around the ear, and stretch the ear outward, for often it can be forced out by these methods.
And if it isn't forced out, then administer extraction with a tool called a *gesti epicicarios subtil*, of which this is the form:
And if it is forced out with the instrument, good; and if not, then administer extraction with a thin, slightly curved implement.
And therefore, if it is not forced out by that, then make a copper cannula and insert the end of the cannula into the ear canal, and seal around the cannula with softened wax and oil, so that only the cannula is open. Then extract with your hand with strong traction, for often with this method we have had success.
But if it is not forced out in this way, then take a lit candle or a similar tool used to hold small birds, and place it on the wound's edge, and then gently wrap cloth around it. And then gently insert that into the ear canal, and then dry the ear of moisture.
And therefore, if it is not forced out with all the methods we have described, then you should consider cutting it open before it becomes a painful abscess or spasm.
And the method of cutting it is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein, and draw out blood according to its nature, and then make a cut between your hands and turn the ear to its upper parts, and make a small incision at the root of the ear towards its thickest part, at a place that is well pressed by you. And let the incision be in the shape of a crescent until it reaches the stone, and, once the stone is found, remove it if possible with appropriate instruments; then close the incision quickly at that time, and heal it until it is cured.
And if the cause of the inflammation in the ear is one of the growths that swells and inflames, then administer its cure and extraction; but if you do not obey this method, then you should take a thin, subtle spatum according to this method: And administer with that the excision of that growth which has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it is already moistened by the ear's vapor, and put it in small pieces, and remove them with tweezers or with a subtle gesture, or with an incision as we have said, because the extraction is then easier.
But for water that has entered the ear, the patient should use sneezing, with caution at the beginning, and fill the ear with old cotton, and lie on the ear that has water in it. If the water is thus expelled, it is good; if not, then take smooth small stones, the length of a finger, heat them slightly in the fire, and the patient puts one into the ear canal and steps on that foot of that side, and strikes with another stone on the stone that is within the ear. Therefore, do not cease with the stone until all the water is expelled.
Therefore, do not cease with the stone until all the water is expelled. And when the water is expelled in this way, you take paper or linen, place one end in the ear, and heat the other end with fire until the majority of it is burned.
And then put in more linen, and do this as many times as necessary until all the water is expelled, and remove it with a cannula as described above for the stone extraction.
But in the extraction of a beast entering the ear, if it is small, like a tick or similar, treat it as we said in the division; but if it is a large creature that appears within the ear itself, then perform its extraction with forceps and hooks, and its removal is easier than all the other things that happen in the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations and your treatment doesn't work, then you must expose the ear to the sun.
And thus, if any creature of the worms appears there, then extract it with fine forceps or hooks; but if no creature appears, then take a cannula that is narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, of which this is the form: And introduce the narrow end into the ear according to how much the patient can tolerate; and then, with a strong suction, suck with it, and do this many times, until all the worms are expelled.
But if it does not yield to this treatment, then you should seal and close the area around the cannula with wax, as we have said; then administer distillations, which the ancients have already tested in the treatment of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your application be with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear with this instrument, of which this is the form: And make it of silver or brass, narrow at the bottom, with a small hole, and broad at the top.
And then it should be like a pump, so that what is within the cavity of the cannula is continuously pushed where it is needed. And if you wish, take the reed and wrap its end properly with cotton, then pour oil into the cavity of the instrument, or the juice of some herb, or whatever other medicine you desire, into the cannula—and that is in the ear—then insert the reed with the cotton on top, and squeeze with your hand gently until the oil is expelled into the cavity of the instrument and the patient feels the oil within.
And whatever is put into the ear should first be slightly warmed over a fire. And be careful that the substance you are distilling into the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
Of the treatment of ear obstructions.
Sometimes, children get this from their mothers' wombs; it also happens in some men, an obstruction in the ear canal due to a plaque or fleshy growth; and this obstruction sometimes forms at the opening of the ear, preventing the passage of sound, and sometimes it's in the external parts.
And that which occurs at the opening, preventing sound from passing, is in the most difficult conditions for treatment.
And in those cases where sound passes through, you should place the patient's ear towards the sun and observe it. And therefore, if obstruction appears, open it with a subtle instrument, of which this is its form:
If its extremity has a small width, one part sharp and the other not; and the instrument has two loops to avoid harming the ear.
And therefore, if the obstruction is due to flesh growing in the ear or its passage, then remove it with fine tweezers and carefully cut away all the flesh until it is gone.
And if the obstruction is in the [ear] canal, then take a fine, thin [stick/rod] and slightly heat it with fire, and then place it into the ear canal.
And therefore, if you have felt obstruction making hearing difficult for the patient, gently relieve the pressure; and be careful not to injure the ear's nerves.
Then place a cloth, sized to fit the hole you have made, soaked in Egyptian ointment, inside the ear.  Do this for several days until you're sure the wound is healed.  Or, take a herb, grind it into powder, and apply it to the area. If the ear is already suppurating, you must remove the herb and replace it with another one wrapped in a bandage made from warmed oil until the suppuration subsides; then treat it further until healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use another treatment to staunch the bleeding, as described in the treatise on [blood]letting.
Chapter 8.
Of the treatment of [a condition] called "athezil" that affects the eyelids.
Athezil, which sometimes affects the eyelids of the eyes, is sometimes moist, sometimes dry.
Therefore, you should hold them with forceps or tweezers, and cut them off with a knife from their roots, and then apply a compress to the areas.
But if pain with bleeding occurs, then cauterize those areas with a small, lens-shaped cautery.
And the best cauterization is near the incisions, and often they return if any cause remains from their roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that occurs on the eyelids.
Often a cause similar to a swelling in its strength and hardness is found in the eyelids, and thus it is called swelling.
And it is a buildup of thick moisture on the eyelid, both above and below.
Therefore, the treatment is to consider if the swelling originates from something external to the eyelid and spreads outward; and the cause of it is light/minor.
Therefore, make a slit over it along its width, and then gently scrape it from all sides until it subsides, then support it with a bandage and excise it.
And if the swelling is large, then you treat it with sutures; and heal it until it is cured.
And if it is small, you will not have any trouble because the ointment will restore it and cause it to heal.
And if the swelling is receding towards the inner part of the eyelid, away from the surface, then elevate the eyelid, support the swelling with a bandage, other than if you intend to make an incision, and press it from every side.  If the eyelid is incised, this will not help in any way.
And after the incision, wash the wound with salt water, and treat the area with something that promotes healing until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Of the treatment of a boil on the eyelid above the eye.
A boil is a sore that develops within the eyelid tissues above the eye, and it is more common in children, worsening the eyes of those afflicted and causing difficulty in the morning; and they cannot see the sunlight clearly because tears accumulate there.
And therefore, you often see them lying on their faces all the time, and they sleep on their faces; and the eyelids below their eyebrows are moist, which are already covered by inflammation, and the presence of a boil is apparent in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel a boil there.
And a method of operation is this: have the patient rest their head on your lap, then place a cloth over them and heat it, and make a circle of it according to the size that contains the boil on all sides.  Then place this over it and press with your fingers everywhere so the boil is contained within the circle.  Then make a small incision in the middle of the moist area, using a lancet, with a slit not wider than the incision made during a bloodletting procedure.
However, in the beginning, you must break open the boil completely until you reach the boil, for in most cases the boil progresses through an incision, following the form of a white pus.
Then remove that pus with cloths that you wrapped around your fingers on the outside and rub it back and forth between your right and left hand until it has disappeared.
And be careful not to press too hard on the incision, so that with the lancet you do not pierce the vessel and damage it.
However, if no boil appears at the beginning of the incision, but you feel a slight pressure on the incision that produces pus; then remove the pus as we described earlier;  then soak cloths in warm water and vinegar and place them over the area and compress them with powders.
And some put salt and bread in the cavity of the incision so that the remaining moisture is absorbed.
And then treat it until it is healed.
But if there is a hot abscess in the area, then treat it with cooling plasters until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Of methods of touching the eye.
When in the eyelids of the eyes, there are pimples/inflammation  that arise beneath the natural skin and become hardened, then these attack the eye and cause ailments such as constant tears and softening of the eyelids and tissues, until this causes destruction of the eye, which is called "tactinir of the eye."  It is treated in four ways: either by cautery with fire; or with a sharp medicine, as previously mentioned in the chapter on cautery; or by cutting and stitching the tactinir; or by means of canes, as I will explain.
And therefore, you should place the patient's head on your lap; then gently turn the eyelid with your left hand, and if it turns, that's good; and if not, insert a needle into that part that is furthest below the eyelid, and push the needle with the thread through it, and this should be — near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow — close to the hairs, and pull the thread to the top through the eyelid, and turn the eyelid with the instrument.
And then, in the part inside the eyelid beneath the hardened hairs, make small incisions with the major lacrimal instrument down to the minor lacrimal instrument; then pull out the thread and place small powder of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, and then press on the eyelid with a tenaculum, and shape it like a myrtle leaf.
However, the shape should be according to the degree of elevation of the eyelid, for this varies greatly in people, for some require a large incision in the eyelid according to the degree to which the eyelid is softened.
And then, using the instrument, make incisions along the two lines you have marked, beginning at the major lacrimal and continuing to the minor lacrimal. And if your incision is near the natural hairs, it should be as wide as the king's finger.
And then, place the forceps at one of the two corners of the wound, and then scrape the entire area; then, using the suture, join the two edges of the wound together with a thin wool thread or thread, and clean the blood; and if you wish, affix the excess thread to the two eyebrows with certain adhesive substances, otherwise do not bother.
And then leave the stitches of thread in place for three or four days, and then treat the wound.
And if you wish, leave the wound without stitches, and treat it with things that dry and constrict, for the eyelid is lifted by the sealing of the wound and its adherence; but stitching is better.  Therefore, the ancients say this.
However, be diligent about the patient, and it is a good operation, and there is no fear for the patient.
And there is another method in treating this, and it is that you should shape the eyelid like a myrtle leaf, and then lift the eyelid with three separated and joined forceps in this manner:
But if that is not possible, holding the forceps, and that is not suitable, then take a needle with thread and place it in the middle of the shape, and insert the other thread near the larger tear duct, and the second thread near the smaller tear duct, and adjust the threads equally between your fingers, and then with those, lift your hand in a suitable lift, raise the entire eyelid on which it is marked as we have described.
And then bring together the two edges of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.
But if an abscess occurs near your incision or fissure, treat that abscess with plasters and similar things, and with ointments.
And sometimes the eyelashes on the eyelid need to be removed, in which case you should use what we have said about incisions; but stitching in such cases is more artificial.
To treat with canes is according to this form: And you must turn the eyelid inside out and cut the figure inside it as I have described; and then, by art, make two thin canes or splints whose length corresponds to the length of the eyelid and whose width is less than the width of the gap. And you have already incised at the extremities of each part, where you have the threads.
Then carefully attach each one to the excess of the eyelid of the eye, and tightly bind the canes in each part, and leave it for a few days, because the flesh will die from the tightness and will be rejected and decompose until it falls off by itself.
But if it has been delayed, then break it with forceps, and then treat the wound until it is healed.
Therefore, once it is consolidated, the eyelid is raised, and the skin is not irritated.
And this is the method for the two canes, which you will make according to this form: and have the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Of lifting irritated skin from a wound with a needle when the skin is hardened.
When there are unnatural, hard, rough, and irritating hairs in the wounds, then the operation for them is that you take a fine needle and put it on a fine linen or silk, and then carefully fit its ends together, each in a very subtle manner. And the length of the threads should be about the length of one palm.
And then you carefully attach another fine thread underneath, and use the ends of that if you want.
And then position the patient's head on your lap, and let it be near the light so that your work is clear, for it is a delicate and minute operation.
And then insert the needle into the root of the attached hair, which needs dexterity, and swiftly penetrate the eyelid until you remove that hair from above the natural hair.
And then pull the hair out above it and place it in the forceps, and let there be one, two, or three hairs, and no more.
And then pull your hand with it until the hair is pulled out, along with the forceps and the natural hair from the eyelid.
But if the forceps is pulled and the hair is not removed, you will pull the forceps in different directions with the ointment that you have prepared, until the hair is pulled out of the wound.
And close it with the vision of the eye, because then you will remove the forceps and the ointment, and everyone will wash and close the eye, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and healthy flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is shorter, then you attach a long hair from the natural hairs, and lift it up with that, or leave it until it extends approximately some distance, and then lift it.
Chapter 13.
Of the treatment of an abrasion which comes on the upper eyelid.
When an abrasion occurs on the eye, and the eyelid is contracted upward, either on the right or left side, due to poor healing of a wound, incision, or cauterization, and is called a harelip, this abrasion or is natural or accidental, and is caused by the healing of a wound, incision, or cauterization, or by similar poorly healed injuries.
The method of treatment in such a case is to break up the scar tissue and separate the lip edges.  Place a piece of linen cloth between them and tie them together until they heal.
And you should not use treatments that dry or constrict; for if you do, the abrasion will return worse than it ever was before.
Use remedies that soften, such as fenugreek, and apply a poultice made from water steeped with mallow and flax seeds, or diachylon ointment, which has been liquefied with an oil.  Dip the cloth into this and apply it as a treatment.
The key to your treatment is to break apart any unhealed scar tissue, returning it to its original form.
And this operation, which we have described, is simply a way of correcting the abrasion so that the area returns to its former shape.
Chapter 14.
Of the treatment of an abrasion that occurs on the lower eyelid.
This abrasion on the lower eyelid, properly called an abrasion, may be either a natural or an accidental affliction.
But accidental abrasions are caused by blows, cuts, cauterization, or similar injuries.
And the method of treating it is that you take a needle with a double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and pass it from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches both extremities of the flesh.
Then spread the flesh apart with the needle and stitch it with the needle, and cut with a wide scalpel. And if the eyelid returns to its proper shape, so much the better; and if not, take a thread and place it in the slit, and with it, close the eyelid, and bind the two fissures together at the lower eyelid.
And let the extremities of the two fissures be at two angles of the incision you have made, meeting, and forming an angle where they come together.
And this figure is the Greek letter: lambda.
And now remove the flesh, in the amount that is the lower sharp edge of the eyelid.
Then bring together the separated parts and sew them with the wool thread; and then treat them with the softening medicines and poultices we mentioned until it is healed.
And if it needs to be repaired by incision, suture, or cautery, then you should make a flat incision on the skin of the eyelid, as previously described. Then separate with a poultice between the two lips, as we have said.
In summary, when treating an eye injury (alxacrati), whether above or below, the procedure should follow the preparation of the eye injury, which can present in various forms.
And the skilled artisan always prepares in every possible way until the form returns to its natural, or nearly natural, state, and the patient according to what is appropriate for the operation and the instruments in the best conditions.
Chapter 15.
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
When you encounter this adhesion in many people, so that the eyelid is firmly glued to the white of the eye, and the natural movement and function are hindered, then you must insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid, and lift or extend it with forceps.
And then you carefully dissect the adhesion with a thin, blunt-edged instrument, so that the incision is not sharp and the patient is not disturbed by the operation.  Leave the instrument in place to avoid injuring the eye with its sharpness.
And your incision should carefully sever the adhesion until the eyelid returns to its natural form and all adhesion is removed.
And then you apply salt water to the eye, washing it; or use a solution of lead dissolved in water.
Then carefully separate the eyelid from the eye with a gentle hand, and apply wool soaked in egg white to the eye.  After three days, use healing remedies until healed.
Chapter 16.
Of the incision of a toenail and the protruding flesh of the tear ducts.
Know that a toenail is of two types: one is nervous, and resembles a hard, fine splinter; or it is non-nervous, resembling frozen white moisture, which when the iron touches it, or is forced to be picked up with forceps, is detached and the forceps do not get stuck in it.
And both types originate from the larger tear duct, gradually extending to cover the eye and obstructing the light and movement of the eye.
But the method of operating on it is that the patient places their head on your lap, then opens their eyes, and you raise the eyelid with your hand, and then grasp the nail with forceps of little bending and pull it away from the surrounding area. Then take a needle and insert a piece of horsehair, or oxhair, or cowhair, or similar, or strong thread, or gradually twist the tip of the needle and place it in the middle of the toenail, and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread; and pull it away from the surrounding area, and scrape away the piece of nail that is obscuring the pupil. And thus you remove it with the hair until the end of it.
And then you cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula or small scissors, and leave the natural tissue of the tear duct intact so that cutting it does not cause a continuous flow of tears.
And sometimes the nail, with forceps or thread, as we have said, is pulled out and then scraped away with a lion's spatula (a scraping tool).  This is the form/shape of it:
And be careful that with the spatula you do not touch the cornea and cause a rupture, and that the pupil is not pierced.
After the incision, put a little powdered salt or a prepared powder into the wound, and leave it there until the next day; then treat it with whatever is appropriate until it is healed.
And if the nail is not painful and you cannot insert a needle, nor is it embedded in the flesh by the forceps, then in many cases this type of nail is treated with medicines, and is healed as I have described and recommended in the division.
And if you wish to incise it, then you open the wound of the patient and take a sharp, slender lion's spatula shaped like this: with subtlety. And if it is often thin and inflamed and has spread to the surrounding area, then apply a distillation from your apothecary's preparation or rose-colored ointment or powdered salt to the wound and cover it until the next day.
And then repeat the procedure until all that is of it is removed, otherwise a hot abscess will be in the wound, for then you leave it and treat the abscess first until it is healed.
And then repeat your procedure on that with care until it is healed.
If the tear duct protrudes in the wound causing great discomfort, it should be suspended with a thread; and cut it from that one part, but do not continue the incision so as not to cause a flow of tears.
Then apply rose-colored ointment and the apothecary's preparation to the tear duct until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the incision of the ulcer and what arises from flesh adhering to the wound.
Sometimes in the wounds of some, red flesh grows and is overlain until it covers the pupil, or approaches or tightens around the eyelids, and strongly compresses the eyelids at the outer edges, resembling the surface of a balustrade.
But the operation on him is that the patient rests his head on your lap; and then open the wounds of that and gather all that flesh with suitable forceps, and hold it with a pair of forceps or a spatula; and then cut the flesh from the beginning until the entire operation with the scalpel is finished, and watch that you do not injure the wound during your operation.
And your incision shall be with the same scalpel that we described in the incision of the nail, or with small forceps, with which the scab is removed, according to the form that will appear in this chapter.
Therefore, when your incision is complete and all that flesh is removed, then fill the wound with coarse salt, or pour into it a red powder similar to corrosive medicines, and place over the wound externally a cloth with egg white until it is assured of a cautious suppuration.
And if any cause of inflammation remains and a cautious bleeding occurs, and you fear a cautious abscess, then leave the wound and treat that abscess with what will cause that abscess to subside, and then repeat the operation until it is healed, and similarly do with the flesh that forms that comes out of the wound of this sort.
However, you should avoid any treatment of the wound by natural or accidental means, working with iron, and do not put your hand into any of these operations until you see that that member is enduring the operation.
Chapter 18.
Of the collection of pus in the wound.
Pus comes from red veins that are crusted over the wound and prevents its healing, and the wound should be treated for many days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the wound in which there is pus is strong and has no other illness than pus, then you collect that pus.
And you should tell the patient to place their head on your lap, and then restrain those veins with an ounce or two, according to your judgment; and that ounce should be of a subtle, twofold application, in this way:
or two ounces gradually in one vessel, according to this form:
And then those veins should be collected with subtle forces, subtly, and the blood should be wiped away hour by hour, until you see those veins pulled away from the wound and are rolled up.
And be careful not to damage the wound with the extremities of the spatula; and if your operation is in the middle of the day before the sun, and be very firm in your operation so as not to cut anything but those veins.
And when you have finished, then you distill into the wound either green or red juice, so that with its sharpness it corrodes what has been pulled away from the vein.
But if that is not possible for you to collect it all at that time, then you plaster it with whatever eases the pain, and leave it for several days until the pain is calmed and the possibility of a hot abscess is ensured.
And then repeat according to the same method until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
Of the reduction of a nasal injury.
When you treat a nasal injury with cautery or a sharp burning medicine, and, as is stated in the description, it is not healed, then there is no remedy in it, but rather you must open the abscess above its maturity, and drain all the moisture and pus until the bone is exposed.
And thus, when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then you scrape it with an instrument of which this is the shape:
And it is called a "sharp head," and it is made of hardened iron, and the head is round, like a pestle, which is made pointed by filing or by fine carving (as is in the following form).
And place that on the corrupted area of the bone, and then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And do this several times, and then restore the area with desiccant and astringent substances.
Therefore, if the area is consolidated and healthy flesh has grown, and the body is free from pus and remains for 40 days, and is not renewed or inflamed, and no accident occurs there, then you know it is healed.
And if not, then it is not a cure, but rather to reduce the fracture to the shape of the nose, and according to this method: and it is that you expose the second bone with iron or with a sharp medicine, and once the bone is exposed, then you take a strip according to this form:
Let the tip of the iron be triangular, and the shaft be thin and tapered to the tip, like this (or, as is often done).
And then place that on the bone, and let it be near the lacrimal bone; and move your hand a little away from the eye, and then move your hand with the strip until it penetrates the entire bone, and the patient will feel this because they will find air escaping when you move your hand.
Therefore, then restore the area with astringent drying medicines, as you have been taught.
Then, when the flesh and the area are hardened, the matter that spread outwards returns to the nose, thus it is easier on the patient.
Chapter 20.
Of the reduction of the eminence of the eye.
When the eye protrudes completely and you do not encounter damage or diminution in the vision, then it is necessary to leave the patient alone and then to follow it, and then to apply leeches to the neck without incisions, and to apply them with good suction; and then apply a liniment made of catnip, aloe, henbane, and sarcocolla to the eye, and then press the plaster over the eye with many powders.
And the method for the powders is to take very fine linen cloths, and each cloth should be doubled into four folds; and make many of those.
And then place those, one upon another, according to the amount the eye needs. And then press upon those with a hard cloth with strong pressure; and repeat the leeches with suction without incisions; and then remove the leeches and leave the eye pressed tight day and night.
But if meanwhile the swelling is softened, then it is necessary that it be very tight.
And then remove the bandage day and night, just as we have said.
And if you see the eye already reduced, good; and if not, then repeat the poultice with powders and the pressure and the leeches until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Of the incision of the eminence of the uvea tunic.
When there is a rupture in the uvea tunic, and it is prominent and protruding from the eyelids like a cluster of grapes, and the person's form is marred by it, and you wish to incise it, then the operation there is as we have recounted, that you insert a needle into the roots of the uvea from the lower to the upper part, and then put another needle on which there is a double thread from the tear duct side, and make that penetrate and let the first needle follow its path; and then you incise the place with the double thread and remove the part of the uvea in the circuit of the needle, and tighten that greatly.
And then remove the needle and place on the eye wool infused in egg white, and leave until the thread with the grape falls out.
And then treat the eye with this, which comforts it, until the wound is healed.
And sometimes, a collection from every side with a cloth circle around the eye adjusts a large protruding mass, and it is then pierced with a fine needle that comes to the eye's edge, and the albuminous moisture runs out, and the eye descends and enters quickly.
And then tighten until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of falconers.
This illness, called alconati, is nothing but a fluid which has collected in the eye, resembling descending water, but it is not that.
However, the method of treatment is to have the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take their head in your hands at two points and move it until you see the fluid coming out of the lower parts, and then it is dried and does not descend, and the light is blocked, and the patient sees things as they appear.
And if it does not descend further, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the fluid is not prepared with what we have said, then have the patient sit between your hands, and then take some fine, thin material, and use that to apply a small amount to the conjunctiva area near the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea (on the exposed area), until the fluid is expelled.
Therefore, when it is expelled, then you instill into the eye warm water, in which you have mixed honey, or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then treat with other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of water descending from the eye.
We have already described the types of water in the division and which ones should be pierced with a lancet, explaining, then, that one [type] follows the health.
Then, you should place the patient between your hands on a bed, and bind their eye tightly.
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of their eye, if the eye in which the water is located is the left eye; or with your right hand, if the eye is the right eye.
And then with your right hand, take an almond, if the eye is left; or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
And then place the tip of the almond close to the eyelid, along the thickness of the ray in the white part of the eye, near the smaller tear duct, and then press the almond with force and roll your hand with it.
And then penetrate into the white of the eye and feel that the almond has now reached the empty space.
And it is necessary that the distance of the almond from the [eye] opening be the same as the space between the pupil and the end of the blackness, and that is the eyelid; for you will see through that pupil with the sight of the eye, through the clarity of the cornea.
And then place the almond into the place where the fluid is, and then pull it down one time, then another.  Therefore, if the fluid descends immediately, then you see the patient looking at what is before them, and the almond in their eye.
And then rest for a little while; therefore, if the fluid has descended, then you pause it again before the almond is thrown out.
And then, when it is dried up and does not descend, then you extract the almond with ease, and gently roll it with your hand. Then dissolve a small amount of clear rock salt in the fluid and wash the inside of the eye with it. Then apply a cloth or a bandage or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white to the eye, and close it.
But we and those of our time place it [presumably the cloth or bandage] over the crushed [eye] area with egg white.
And if you cannot push your almond into the eye because of its hardness – for some people have very hard eyes – then you must take a substance called 'alberid', which is of this form:
And then pierce the conjunctiva with it, and do not press your hand into the hole, and you will only make a subtle passage for the almond.
And then place the almond in as we have said.
And complete your work by preparing a suitable sleeping area for the patient, where they sleep on their back in a dark room, and all movement is prohibited.
And place the patient in a position such that their nature is relaxed, and their head is not turned to either the right or left side at all.
And the bandage should be left in place according to the patient's condition until the third day.
And then, remove that in the darkened room and remove the covering of their eyes, show them some things, and then replace the bandage until the seventh day.
And you should not do this at the time of the treatments or immediately after the infusion. Having this, you should do this so that the water can easily pass through the great and vehement guarding.
However, if a boil/abscess occurs, then it is necessary to remove the dressing before the seventh day, and to treat it with what will cause the boil/abscess to subside.
Then you cover the patient's eyes and place a bandage over their face, which will regulate the movement of their eyes beneath it for several days, keeping them in a darkened room.
And gradually, the patient should be taken out of that room and gradually returned to their normal activities.
And know that in a difficult case, the student is not excused from examining the patient sometimes, and then you should be bold in your operations.
And it has come to our knowledge from some of those who are at Artach, and some said that a fire was made in the Ayrac, a large hole through which water was drawn.
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has accomplished this, nor have I read about it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is new.
And these are the forms of the types of medicines, so that those who do not know them may understand them:
And they should be made of bronze or iron properly, and their extremities should be shaped with this triangular subtlety, the sharp end thus, as the form is.
Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
When various growths of flesh have arisen in the nose, some of which are caused by something resembling a very heavy scorpion or a large polyp; and this illness is called polyp because it resembles that depicted fish. And some of it is cancerous, ulcerous, dark-colored flesh; and some of it is lion-like flesh, not dark-colored.
Therefore, for that flesh which is not fraudulent nor cancerous, you should make the patient sit between your hands and expose them to the sun, and open the patient's nostrils, and then prick the flesh with your lancet. Then extract it to the exterior, and then dissect what you have grasped of it with a sharp, thin spatula from one side until you know all the flesh has been removed; for if any part remains from which the excision is possible, then you slice that with one of the thin instruments with ease until nothing is left of it. However, if it is accompanied by blood or a hot abscess, then you apply what is necessary; or if it is a malignant abscess, then you cauterize it until the blood is separated and all the cavities are removed.
And then, after the incision, place vinegar and water or wine in the nose. But if the nose is open and moisture flows from it to the palate, then know that it is already healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside there is still corrupted flesh upon the excess bones of the nose to which the incision has not reached.
Therefore, then it is necessary to insert a piece of lead (or a similar dense material), and make many small incisions, placing the space between each incision at the width of a finger or less.  Then, you should make the patient comfortable, and insert one end of the lead into the nose with a probe or another appropriate instrument.
And after doing this, stimulate the patient's breathing until the moisture reaches the nasal passages and exits through their throat, as you often see children do in school, and it is an easy thing to accomplish.
And then place the two ends of the lead, one end emerging from the nose and the other remaining inside, and then apply a scraping/excision of flesh to the incisions in the lead, and continue until you know the flesh is removed around the lead's incisions.
And then remove the lead, and place a poultice, similar to bloodletting, near the nose, and do this for three days or more, until the ointment has corroded all remaining flesh.
And finally, place a lead cannula in the nose for several days until healed.
But if you need a more conclusive cure, use this one.
And this is the form of the instrument for nasal purging, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nostrils:
And make this of silver or brass, which should be similar to a small, open lamp, like a little shell, and the opening similar as well.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like a pipe, and the cannula of the purgation instrument should be flat, open; at the back of which should be a handle, with which you hold it when you heat the oil or water that you want of juices and subtle substances.
Chapter 25.
Of the ulcers that appear in the extremities of the nose.
Often an ulcer arises at the extremities of the nose, and it grows larger and worsens over several days until it is very noticeable and difficult to treat.
And therefore, you should cut it [the ulcer] at the beginning of its appearance, and remove all of it. And then place either a cautery or a burning medicine on the affected area.
However, if its incision is delayed until it has grown large, then consider if it is hardened, hard, dark-colored, and with little sensation.  If so, do not touch it with iron, for it is a deep-seated abscess; for often, whoever incises this abscess brings great harm to the person who had it.
And if the abscess is easily touched and not dark-colored, and sometimes incision is possible throughout it, then evacuate the patient and incise it without fear, and treat the area with what dries and constricts it until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of the suturing of the nose, lips, and ear when the continuity is broken by plague or similar ailments.
Know that when you encounter a break in continuity in one of these cartilages, you achieve little in that operation except in certain individuals.
Therefore, when you encounter a cause of that sort in someone, consider if it is a fresh plague with its own blood, and if so, bring together the two sides of the wound with sutures, and then treat it until it is healed.
And if the edges of the broken skin are already separated, and each is made sound, then you must scrape each part of their visible skin until blood appears. And then bring together the two edges with sutures, tighten them, and sprinkle dragon's blood and crushed herbs over them.  Place a diafinicon plaster, or some other consolidating plaster, on the powder. Leave this bound for two or three days, then remove it, replace the plaster, and leave it until the pus is separated.  Then treat with ointment until healed.
But the method of suturing is that you bring the broken skin together either with needles, as we described in suturing the belly, or join the break with adhesive, as we have shown you.
Chapter 27.
Of the removal of those things that appear between the two edges/lips in the internal parts.
Often, men experience hard abscesses resembling millet seeds within the folds of their lips; some are smaller, some larger.
Therefore, you must turn back the lips and excise each hard spot completely, and then fill the area with scraped linen until the bleeding has stopped.  Then wash the area with sharp wine and treat it with something astringent until healed.
Chapter 28.
Of the incision of flesh adhering to the gums.
Often, there is flesh adhering to the gums, which the ancients called "albulus."  In this case, you must separate it with a needle or forceps, cut it off at its base, and allow the pus or blood to drain.
And then apply scraped linen or other astringent or drying powders to the area.
And if that flesh returns, then cut it again and cauterize it, for the cautery will prevent it from returning.
Chapter 29.
Concerning the extraction of teeth with a metal instrument.
When on the surface of the teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums, rough, hard, and sometimes blackened or yellowish scales form, causing gum inflammation and resulting in the teeth becoming loose.
Therefore, you should place the patient between your hands, resting their head on your lap, and extract the teeth where these scales and similar dark, gritty substances appear until nothing remains, thus removing the blackness, yellowing, and other impurities.
If you have removed what was there at the beginning of the procedure, it is good.  Otherwise, repeat the procedure the next day, and again on the second and third day until you achieve the desired outcome.
And know that teeth require many different tools and shapes, depending on how you prepare for your operation. And therefore, the scraper used to scrape the inside of the tooth is different from the scraper used to scrape between the teeth, in other ways, and these various scrapers need to be prepared by you, which you will see soon.
Chapter 30.
Of the removal of teeth.
You should treat the tooth's pain with every effort and take your time with every extraction, because there is no way to compensate for the damage done to it when it's removed, for it is a delicate substance that requires careful consideration during the extraction process.
However, when the patient insists on having a tooth removed, you must be absolutely certain which tooth is the painful one, because many times the pain deceives the patient, suggesting it's in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one, and the pain doesn't stop until the diseased and painful tooth is removed.  We have seen this ourselves through the experiences of barbers (or surgeons).
Therefore, how are you to be certain which tooth is the painful one, and that you know it well?  Then you should make incisions around the tooth with a substance having some medicinal properties, until the tooth is separated from the gum on all sides.  Then carefully remove it with your fingers, or with fine forceps, little by little until you detach it.
And then, if necessary, use strong large pliers for good leverage or firm grasping, and place the patient's head between your knees to hold it firmly so it doesn't move.  Then extract the tooth in a straight manner, so that you don't break it, and do not cause the patient excessive pain.
And if it is not easily extracted, then take one of those instruments, and place it under it from all sides with ease, and apply force to remove it, just as was done initially.
But if the tooth is cracked or decayed, then you must cover the hole with cloth and press it with a thin, sharp instrument so that it does not fracture when you apply the pliers.
And you must carefully make incisions around the entire gum, and be very careful not to break it and leave a portion of it behind, returning to the patient with more malice than the original pain.
And be careful not to do what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and audacity regarding tooth extraction, without administering what we have described; for often they bring great illnesses upon people which are more difficult to heal than the initial problem, and the roots of the teeth remain, some or all, or they pull out the tooth with some jaw bone, as we have often witnessed.
And after the extraction, the mouth should be rinsed with hot wine or vinegar with salt.
And if there is bleeding, as often happens, then apply a small amount of alum and sprinkle it on the wound, and if that doesn't stop it, cauterize it.
The shape of the forceps and delicate pliers, with which the tooth is initially extracted, should be long at the tip, with a short, thick handle, so that they do not bend when using them.
And they should be like that, with a thick handle so that when you tighten them, they don't bend, with short tips.
And they should be made of Indian iron, with straight tips, and on the tips of these, there are teeth that interlock and tighten with strong constriction, and sometimes their tips are shaped like the beak of a stork (or heron), which is strong and tight.
Chapter 31.
Of the removal of teeth and the extraction of bones from fractured mandibles.
When you need to remove a broken tooth, which is still causing problems, you should place a compress with some wool on the area for a day or two until the area is softened; then, use forceps or pliers whose tips are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork or heron, the shape of forceps:
The tips of them should be made sharp, like a file or a whetstone.
And if you are unable to extract the tooth with these forceps or pliers, you must then cut away the surrounding tissue and expose the root and insert a small lever, whose shape is like this:
And it should have a short, thick end, a little bit, and not be too thick so as not to break.
So, if the root is thus extracted, it is good; and if not, use these other instruments, of which these are the shapes: the first instrument is triangular in shape, with some thickness:
The shape of the second instrument should be triangular, with a more slender tip.
And having used these instruments, proceed now with this other instrument, having two ramps, whose shape is approximately this: and with other instruments, which I will describe for tooth extraction; for the extraction is aided by an instrument shaped like a large hook, and this is its form:
of triangular, bent or short shape, which should have some thickness, and not be too narrow so as not to break.
And further understand that the instruments for teeth are similar to other instruments.
But the skillful and subtle artisan in the art, finds for himself, according to what the operation and the various illnesses signify to him; for there are illnesses for which the ancients did not describe or prescribe specific instruments, due to their various forms.
But if the jawbone or other bones of the mouth are fractured, or decayed, then apply pressure to the fractured part, placing it in its proper position, using the appropriate instruments and forceps we have described for extracting teeth roots, and assist it with the method of which this is the form:
And apply gentle, gradual pressure, and hold it in place with the mouth to prevent movement or escape until the bone is fully set; and then restore the area with appropriate medicines.
But if there is a small, painful swelling in the bone, then remove that swelling and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
Of the treatment of teeth prominent above the others.
When teeth are prominent and do not follow their natural course, and the form is unsightly, especially in women, and particularly in venerable young women, then you must consider: if the tooth is close to another tooth, and separation or repositioning is impossible, then remove that tooth; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then cut it with an instrument of this shape: resembling a pig's snout, made of Indian iron with a very sharp end.
And the incision you make should be gradual over several days due to the tooth's hardness and so that it doesn't damage other teeth.
And if a prominent tooth is exposed for filing, then file it with an Indian iron file of this shape:
And it should be entirely made of Indian iron and easily shaped; and it should have many small points, just like the file with which needles are made, with which the tooth should be filed little by little over many days with ease, so that no other tooth is damaged or broken. And then, finally, smooth it and root it with some razors.
And if a tooth has a fractured part that cuts the tongue, then you must file it until the roughness of that fracture is removed and filled in, so that the tongue is not injured and speech is not impaired.
Chapter 33.
Concerning the restoration of broken teeth with gold or silver fillings.
When teeth are fractured or displaced by impact or trauma, and the patient cannot hold the missing piece, and you have treated it with astringent medicines, and your treatment has been ineffective, then, because it does not fall out, it is better to use a gold filling rather than silver, for silver becomes green and deteriorates in a few days, while gold never changes.
And the filling should be so fine and thick according to the amount needed to fit between the teeth; and the method of application is to take the filling and place twice its length between two healthy teeth, and then continue shaping it with two curves of the filling between the fractured teeth, or one or more, until the filling reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the fitting process back to the original starting point, and hold it firmly but gently until it is no longer broken.
And your grip, with which you hold the filling against the tooth roots, must be firm so that it does not fall out.
And then trim the excess ends of the filling with forceps or scissors, and carefully adjust it in place, and shape it and hide it between the healthy tooth and the broken tooth, so that it does not injure the tongue. And then leave it firmly in place as it remains.
However, if it is loose or broken, firmly reattach it or them with another filling in such a way throughout the time.
And this is the method for teeth, and the procedure for restoring two healthy teeth and two broken ones, as seen in these bound teeth:
And when one or two teeth are returned to their sockets, and are reattached as we have described, and remain firmly in place.
And only skilled and knowledgeable artisans can do this.
And sometimes a piece of cow bone is shaped like a tooth and placed in the gap where the tooth is missing, and fastened as described, and remains and serves as a replacement for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Of the constriction of the ligament that affects the tongue and hinders speech.
This ligament, which sometimes forms under the tongue, is either natural, present at birth, or accidental and caused by a wound that has healed.
And the operation on it involves opening the patient's mouth, holding their head; lifting their tongue, and then carefully cutting the nerve ligament, according to the width, until the tongue is freed from its constriction.
However, if there is any hardness or knotting there, resulting from a healed wound, then you should apply a cautery and cut through it according to its width, until you have severed the ligament and the knotting has been dissolved.
And be careful not to create a fissure in the flesh, and that you do not cut too deeply and cause bleeding.
And then wash the incision site with water, vinegar, or cold water; and then place a linen cloth under the tongue. This is a pad that the patient will hold under their tongue every night, so it doesn't heal again.
But if bleeding occurs, apply powdered vitriol to the area; but if the bleeding persists, then cauterize the area with a suitable, smooth cautery. And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Of the removal of a ranula (a cyst) under the tongue.
Sometimes, a boil resembling a small tumor develops under the tongue, hindering the tongue's natural function; and it swells significantly until it fills the mouth.
And the treatment for it is to open the patient's mouth, sitting facing the sun, and examine the abscess.
And if you see it as a dark color or black, hard, to which the patient feels no sensation, then do not touch that which is a cancer.
And if it has turned white, which indicates moisture, then you place a lancet on it, and cut it open with a sharp blade, and separate it from every side; and if blood flows during your operation, then you apply crushed alum, that is, vitriol, so that the blood is stemmed.
And then return to your work until you have removed it completely, until it has been washed with sour wine and salt; and treat it with further treatment for this until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
Of the removal of abscesses on both ears and those found in the throat, and other abscesses.
When an abscess develops in the throat, meaning glands that have swelled together, which have burst outward and are called "two ears," and when you treat them with what we have described in the division and they are not healed, then consider if the abscess is hard, dark in color, and with little sensitivity; then do not touch it with iron.
And if it is reddish in color and the root is thick, then do not touch it with iron for the sake of blood flow; rather, allow it to mature, and then either you will drain it, or it will break open on its own.
And if it is whitish, soft, and its root is subtle, then it is one that should be incised.
And the operation on it is that you should, before your operation, consider if the abscess has already rested, having complete rest, or if it has diminished with some lessening; and then make the sick person sit in front of the sun, and let their head be in your lap, and open their mouth, and let the attendant hold their tongue down with a very fine instrument, of which this is the shape:
And it should be made of silver or brass, and be as thin as a knife.
So, when you press the tongue with it and the abscess is shown to you, and you have applied your gaze to it, then take a lancet and place it in the opening, and pull it outward in parts as much as you can. After this, when you pull out some part of the tissues, then cut that with an instrument of this shape:
After this, when you pull out some part of the tissues, then cut that with an instrument of this shape: and it is similar to forceps, but the ends are curved, so that the opening of each is on the opposite side, very sharp, which should be made of tempered iron.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then cut it with a spatula of this shape:  And it should be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And after you have incised one opening, cut the other according to this same method of incision, and after the incision the patient will recover from the cold.
However, if bleeding ensues, treat with water decoction of pomegranate rind or myrtle leaves, or similar astringent remedies, until the bleeding is reduced, and then treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat or near the two ears, and cut those according to what I have said about the incision of two openings (incisions).
And I once treated a woman with an abscess that had formed in her throat, which abscess was tending toward a dark colour, with little sensation, which had already closed off her throat, and the woman was breathing with a narrow airway, and had already been forbidden food and water, and she was close to death if it had lasted another day or two.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had formed two fistulas before it broke through two openings.
Therefore, I treated it fistulously and inserted a probe into one of them, and pulled it out, and a large portion of it was pulled out, and then I incised the opening of the other fistula, and then I opened her mouth and pressed down on her tongue, and then I inserted the probe into that abscess.
And then I excised a large part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Therefore, the woman's throat was completely healed, and she immediately began drinking water, and then ate food, so I continued to incise that abscess many times for a long time, and another abscess followed in the same place, which I incised until it was finally resolved.
Therefore, I skillfully cauterized her throat, thus adding to her treatment; and then I walked away and did not know what God had done to her (or to me) in that instance.
Chapter 37.
Of the incision of a boil when it is abscessed.
When catarrh settles on the uvula, and it is abscessed and protracted, then it is called a perpendicular boil; and if it is in the lower part, thick and round, then it is called a bubo.
But when it is cured with what we have said in the division, and you do not consider your cure complete, and sometimes a boil has already been evacuated and is subtle, then it is necessary for you to incise that which is swollen and round; and if it is of that length, and is blood-red, or dark coloured, and is not tender to the touch, then you must test the incision there, for there is fear of the illness in that case.
And when you see it according to the manner I have described, by its whiteness and length, have the patient sit up straight and press down on the tongue with an instrument that will reveal its shape, and then place the knife in a position above the boil, and pull down to incise it with one of the two instruments that are described in the incision of two boils.
And it is necessary to incise only that which is aligned with the natural border without excess, for if you incise more than that, you will harm the patient's speech.
And after the incision, use what we have described in the incision of two boils, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision, use a cautery without fear, and the method of cautery in this case is only with sharp water.  You should place the patient's head in your lap, then press down on the tongue with the instrument we have mentioned.  Next, take the water mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and apply it to the living tissue with a moderate amount, filling the cavity of the instrument, which has the following shape:
Let the tip of the cavity where the medicine is placed be like the cavity of a spoon for collecting herbs, and place the instrument with the medicine on the ulcer.  The patient lies on their side so that any saliva or mucus from the mouth flows away due to the medicine, so that nothing from it reaches the patient's throat and harms them.
Then hold the medicine with your hand and press it onto the uvula for half an hour until you see it blackened and settled by the medicine's action.
And if you wish, take a cloth and wrap it around the tip of the herb, then dip the cloth in the medicine.  Insert the herb with the cloth into a tube/cannula until the cloth adheres to it. Repeat this as many times as needed to achieve the desired cauterization of the ulcer. Then leave it until it dries and falls off in about three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it.  Then, after the cauterization, clean the area around the ulcer with a cloth dipped in wine.  Remove any remaining medicine from around it and wash with cold water.  Treat the outside with an external application and the inside with healing remedies until it is healed.
And this type of treatment is safer than incisions and less likely to cause fear.
Sometimes the ulcer is cured with something more delicate than cauterization or incisions, for it is cured by fumigation in this way: take mint, yarrow, oregano, rue, Arabic gum, chamomile, marjoram and similar herbs, and combine all or some of these in a pot.  Submerge them in sour wine and boil. The pot should be securely sealed, and a hole should be in the middle of the pot, over which a hollow metal instrument should be placed, preferably silver or brass.
And the end of the instrument should be inserted into the patient's mouth until the vapor rises to the ulcer through the cannula, until the ulcer is significantly dimmed.
And then repeat this many times until it is dry.  Be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of an abscess, for it would worsen the abscess.  You should not do this without a diagnosis of a mature abscess.
But if this instrument is unavailable, then take a reed and place an egg shell at its end, so that the patient's mouth is protected, for the egg shell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
Of the removal of thorns and what adheres to the throat and other similar conditions.
Many times a thorn or fish bone or some other thing adheres to the throat.
Therefore, you should remove whatever is visible, upon which you direct your gaze,  after pressing the tongue with an instrument in front of a light, so that what is in the throat is revealed to you.
And that which is hidden and concealed in the throat, you should make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, for the object lodged in the throat will be expelled by vomiting.  Or make the patient swallow a piece of bread or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or have the patient swallow a piece of dry sea sponge, bound tightly with a bandage, and thus, as it passes to the area where the thorns are, they will be expelled. Or take an eel and drink it with a bandage, and place it within and quickly extract it; or take a leek and quickly put it in and quickly draw it out.
But if it is not expelled by those methods we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument in this manner:
And it should be larger than a small ray, and at its end there should be a cavity which you can easily insert into their throat.
And have them raise their head, and be careful not to touch their throat bone, so that you don't cause them pain, and with that you push the bone or thorn, or the physician pushes it with their hand.
But if the patient can push it themselves, better, because of their knowledge of the location of the affliction, and push it downwards, and pull their hand with the instrument upwards, all this according to the quantity that is prepared for them until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
Of the extraction of bloodsucker attached to the throat.
When the leech is treated with what we have said in the division of treatment with medicines, and it does not yield, then consider placing the patient's throat in the sun, after you have pressed the patient's tongue with an instrument which we have described to you.
Therefore, if you see the bloodsucker, extract it with a small hook or with delicate, skillful gestures.
And if it is not possible for you to remove it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat, and then place a heated iron into the concavity of the cannula, and do this many times (until the bloodsucker is dead and removed from the throat), and keep the patient away from water all day.
Then take a vessel full of cold water, and open the patient's mouth to it, and rinse the mouth with it; and let him not swallow anything, and then pour more water from your hand, for the bloodsucker, as soon as it feels the water, will move.
But if it is not expelled by what we have described, then fumigate the patient with incense or with asafoetida using the instrument we described in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so that it will fall.
And there is another method of fumigation for it, which is that you take a bowl in which burning coals are placed and the bowl is covered with a cover in the middle of which there is a hole, and the tip of the instrument is placed in that hole; and then perform the fumigation above; and have the patient place his mouth on the tip of the cannula, and hold his mouth closed so that the fumigation is not expelled until you know that the fumigation has reached the bloodsucker, for the bloodsucker will immediately fall.
And if it does not fall, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and prevent the patient from drinking, and let him eat salty foods and onions, and do not let him drink water, and thus it is necessary that with this treatment it will be expelled.
And this is the form of the instrument with which a bloodsucker is treated from the throat when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps in some ways, except that it has some curvature in it. Which is placed on the throat, and its tip is similar to a stork's beak, which is smooth, on which it is sharpened with a file, so that when we grasp something, it does not slip.
Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of the discourse on the appearance of abscesses and their incision.
Abscesses are of many types, in many ways, according to their appearance, each one described in this book.
And they are diverse in their opening and incision in two ways, of which one is according to the type of abscess itself; and according to the moisture we find in them.
And the second way is according to the locations in the body where they occur, for an abscess in the head is different from an abscess in the buttocks; and an abscess in fleshy areas is different from one in a joint; and for each of them there is a specific judgment for treatment.
And moreover, some abscesses should not be opened until the pus has matured within them or until they are fully developed.
Some other abscesses should be lanced while they are still inflamed and not yet fully developed, like abscesses near joints, for when an abscess is near a joint, its presence prolongs until it affects the area around it, and the ligaments or nerves of that joint are easily corrupted, causing contraction of that limb. Or it's near a major limb, and if you delay the lancing until it's fully matured, it might damage the major limb. Or if it is near the anus, then lance the unripe one;  but do not lance a raw, incompletely digested one, unless it's near the anus, for fear that it might penetrate into the surrounding areas of the anus and cause a fistula, or create a condition that won't heal. But you must know the time to lance the abscess, and that is when it is mature.
And you know it is mature when there is a cessation of pain and fever, and a decrease in swelling and throbbing, and the clarity of the abscess head, and the other signs.
And therefore, you must make the incision in the area just below the abscess and from the pus that comes from draining the swelling.
And the incision should always be along the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and in places away from tendons, nerves, arteries; and, finally, in all similar locations where there is no reflex; for in those that are reflexive, use an incision appropriate to that particular limb.
However, when the abscess is in a fleshy area, it is better to let it be until the digestion of it is confirmed, according to the process we have described; for if you incise it before that, the course of the illness will be prolonged, and much filth will be released, and the abscess walls will become harder and deeper.
However, some abscesses must be incised across the width of the flesh or body, based on necessity, or in a way appropriate to the limb.
And you must make a small incision in small abscesses, and a large or wide incision, or multiple incisions, in large abscesses, according to the difference in size of the abscesses.
And others are abscesses where the skin must be hollowed out and incised, when done this way and when it is in a state where it is already ready, similar to that which happens in case of large boils and carbuncles.
And some are incised with three-sided incisions; and some are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like abscesses of the joints.
And some of them are treated with round incisions and crescent-shaped incisions, and similar ones.
But those, where there is no such thing as deep abscesses, you should puncture them with a superficial, or simply flat, incision.
And when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, pierce it and do not attempt to remove all the matter at once; having removed a portion, then close the abscess until the following day, and then remove a larger portion, and do this repeatedly according to a gradual process until it is fully drained.
And especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly person, for the animal spirit is often resolved with the expulsion of pus, and the patient often dies quickly, and you should operate with caution.
Observe this chapter with great caution, and regarding your incision for these abscesses, you must cleanse the sores and consider whether the abscess wound is small or a simple incision. Then apply ointments of lead or of old cotton.  If the abscess is large and the fissures of the incision are numerous, you must apply medicaments to each opening until they unite.
If a portion of the skin has been cut away from the abscess, or if you have created a hollow around it, then you must fill it with old linen or cloth strips, like when removing crusts or scabs, without moisture.  Hold this in place for three days. Afterward, treat it with appropriate ointments until healed.
But if bleeding occurs during your procedure, then apply cold water and vinegar mixed with a linen cloth, and place this over the bleeding area repeatedly.
However, if the bleeding persists, you must apply the regimen and cures and powders mentioned in many places throughout this book and its divisions.
But if it is wintertime, and the abscess is in a location with many nerves, then you must infuse powders in warm wine and oil, and apply them to the affected area.
And if it is summer, and the areas are fleshy, then you must apply powders mixed with water and oil or with wine and oil, and keep this cool until the third day, as we have said.  Then you must drain the abscess and cleanse it, and administer the appropriate treatment until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary for the understanding of the treatment of abscesses in general, but according to the method of differentiation I have already discussed, each type of abscess has its own treatment method detailed in specific chapters.
Chapter 41.
Of the incision of abscesses which appear on the neck of the head.
Small abscesses form on the neck of the head, and these are of various types of nodes containing tissues that are characteristic of them; and their various natures are numerous.
And some contain pus, and these contain moisture similar to lime. And some contain moisture similar to dust, and similar to them; and some are stony, hard.
And in the incision of all of them, and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, as extracting them does not cause contrary injury.
And the surgical procedure for cutting these is that you probe them with an instrument shaped somewhat like this, which is called a "probe," until you know what they contain.
If what it contains is moisture, then you divide it with an incision along its length by a superficial incision in this way:
And begin the incision from line B to line G.  Then, once the moisture has been evacuated, you scrape the skin that contained the moisture, and remove anything remaining, for it may return if any remains.
Then, soak some cotton in Egyptian unguent, if available, or in water and salt otherwise; and fill the wound with this and leave it until the next day, for this will corrode any remaining parts of the skin.
And then apply more Egyptian unguent to that cotton a second and third time, if necessary, until you are confident that no part of the skin remains; then treat the wound with unguent until healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodes, then you should incise it in this manner: with an incision shaped like a cross, and place hooks between the two sides of the incision and scrape it from every side, and exert your strength in removing the membrane that contains it.
But if your effort encounters resistance, then do as I told you initially.
And similarly, do the same for a stony abscess in terms of incision and treatment as we have told you; and incision on a stony abscess is easier, because it has little blood and little moisture.
And sometimes some of these abscesses that are on the head of some men, lack moisture altogether; the reason is that I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess like a hard, rough, white stone, which could not be broken, and if someone were struck with it, it would hurt.
However, for other accidental abscesses on the head, this is not the case, as for abscesses that appear near the heads of children and the roots of their ears, but the incision for all of these should be a superficial incision.
And make the perforation of those from the lowest part of them, so that the body is relieved of the blood/pus in the lower parts.
And then treat them with whatever is appropriate for that treatment.
Chapter 42.
Of the incision of scrofulas that occur in the neck.
Often these abscesses appear in the neck and armpits and groin; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those that appear in the neck, and many are generated between them, and every scrofula of those is within its own skin/membrane, and like the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the types of these scrofulas are many, for of those some are stony, and of those are those containing moisture, and of those are malignant ones which do not respond to treatment.
Therefore, in that one which you find to be in good condition by touch, whose visible colour is similar to the colour of a boil, and is soft in all directions, and is not connected to the neck nerve, nor the veins, nor the artery, and is not deep, you should incise it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body's line of G to the line of B, and drain it from every side, and spread the edges of the boil with forceps, or with many forceps if needed, as we have said for the abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is more important that the vein or nerve not be cut.
And if the pus is not very sharp, do not use your hand with an incision, or disturb the patient, and cut what is not necessary to cut; for if you were to cut a vein or artery and prevent your operation, then place crushed vitriol or other powders that stop bleeding, and press the wound, and leave it until the inflammation of the abscess subsides and the wound becomes softened and begins to be pus-filled. When the blood is cut off.
Therefore, return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then check with your index finger if there are any other causes of the small boils, then cut them and clean them.
And if there is a large vein at the base of the boil, then you should not cut that boil from its roots. Before that, you should tie that with a tightly folded cloth and leave it until it falls away on its own without harm.
And then fill the wound with old cloth that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
And if you cut the boil completely, then you should close the two edges of the wound and stitch it up as soon as there is no excess fluid remaining.
But if you see that there is excess fluid remaining due to the size of the boil, you should proceed to cut the root of it, extract it, and administer stitches and what was previously stated.
And those boils containing moisture, pierce them with a superficial incision where you see the point of maturation, and place the incision to draw the pus out of the body, as we said.
And then administer a poultice, some with ointment and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And then, when you see the wound already cleansed, you treat it with a healing ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Of the incision of the boil of the abscess that is inside the throat.
The ancients prescribed this incision for the boil, and yet no one in our land has seen it done.
And this is the writing of the speech of those people.
However, in people with back pain, the extraction of the boil should be avoided, as it may not be beneficial, because all the veins and major arteries of the patient are located there.
However, in those who have hot abscesses in the mouth, throat, or ears, when the illness is not in the throat, it is necessary to use the boil incision to avoid the damage caused by burning.
Therefore, when we want to do this, we should incise the boil below the three or four circles of the boil, using a small incision along the width, between two circles, with the incision being in a wedge shape, not in the cartilage, and this place is suitable for incision, because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels there are distant.
And if the physician is afraid, then it is necessary to open the throat abscess with a probe, and then cut the abscess until it reaches the channel, but avoid the blood vessels if you see any.
And then incise the wedge-shaped opening as we have described; and the incision of the channel is signified by the pus that comes out of what has been broken open, and by the cessation of the voice.
And leave the wound open for a certain time.
Therefore, when the time has passed in which perforation is feared, bring together the two sides of the abscess wound, and stitch it together without the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that promote the growth of flesh until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the summary of the discourse we have recounted, is no more than to see that some of these abscesses have already blocked the patient's airway, and the patient has come close to death, and the windpipe of the patient is blocked, and some would cut the epiglottis so that the patient breathes over the area of the wound by some respiration, and is thus saved from death.
And because of this, I command to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness is consumed; and the malice of it lasts for three days; and then I command to sew the wound up, and to treat it until it is healed.
And this that I myself have seen is that a servant took a knife and placed it in their throat and cut a part of the lung tissue with it, and I was called to treat her, and I found her moaning as the dying moan, and I uncovered the wound and found little blood that had come from the wound.
Therefore, I was told that she had not cut a vein or artery, and air was coming out of the wound, and I treated her until she was healed.
And it did not happen to the servant if she did not have a sore throat, and after some days she returned to better health.
And now I say that in the treatment of epilepsy there is no fear.
Chapter 44.
Of the treatment of an abscess that occurs outside the throat, and is called a throat hernia.
This abscess, called a throat hernia, is a large abscess according to the color of the body, and is common in women.
And it is in two ways, for it is either natural or accidental.
And in the natural case, there is no way to cure it.
And the accidental case is in two ways, one of which is similar to fatty tumors, and the other way is similar to an abscess formed by the blockage of an artery, and in that one there is fear (of worsening). And one should not presume to apply iron (cauterization) to it except in the case of a small one. And you should probe it and investigate it with your fingers, and if you find it similar to a fatty tumor, and it is not connected to any vein, then you should cut it like the tumors, and remove it with whatever contains it from the skin and subcutaneous tissue; and if not, then the whole nature of it should be investigated, and the area should be treated with the appropriate treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
Of the incision of the types of tumors.
There are many types of tumors, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division.
And it is necessary for me to recount here the difference between a tumor and a fistula, as there might be doubt.
Thus I say that with a fistula there is heat, fever, and intense pain until the ebullition of the superfluity is calmed; and when putrefaction is complete, the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with a tumor there is no heat, fever, or pain, and it resembles that lion-like lump which is in the bladder itself.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a swelling and is made thus like a bladder, be it larger or smaller, and they are of two types, either fatty and containing moisture, and the colors of moisture are many, as I said in the division.
Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of a tumor, you should examine it and investigate it at the beginning with the instrument called the *intromes*, as its form will be found in the chapter near this one.
And it is a method of investigating abscesses and all tumors, and you should take this instrument and insert it into the most moist area you find in the abscess, and you will rotate your fingers with that small instrument little by little until you know that the instrument has already pierced the skin.
And finally place your hand according to the size of the abscess, and then remove the *intromes* and consider what has come out in the residue.
And if the flowing moisture, of whatever color it may be, is expelled, then you cut it with a superficial incision, as I have said in the other abscesses.
And if there is no moisture from the *intromes*' residue, then know that it is fatty.
And dry it with an incision having a cross shape, according to this form: So, as I have shown you, and suspend it with hooks, and scrape the surrounding skin from all sides with ease, and if possible, preserve the skin or sac over it and extract the pus with the forceps.
But if it breaks during the operation, it is not possible to extract all the pus, and this often happens.  Then you extract it in pieces until nothing remains inside.
For if any part, little or much, remains inside, the forceps will return to the same position.
And if you see that any small part remains inside, then fill the wound with some sharp, corrosive powders, compress the wound, and apply a poultice of warm compresses to the area, and treat it with the other remedies until it heals.
And if the wound is large, then you stitch the two edges of the wound and treat it with something that promotes healing by skin closure.
But if there is a pulsating vein near or far from the wound, then you cauterize and fill the area with crushed verdigris (copper sulfate) and leave it there for two or three days until the wound can heal, and the blood stops boiling; then return to the opening of the remainder of the wound.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of instruments necessary for surgery and perforation.
Of those (instruments) which have three types, some are large, some are medium-sized, and some are small.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
They are made of iron, or bronze, with properly rounded ends, so that they can easily penetrate the abscesses.
And these are the forms of the instruments, and they are called probes, and one of them is called a lancet.
And there are three types, for some are large, medium, and small.
The form of the large instrument, its shape:
The form of the medium instrument, its shape:
The form of the small instrument, its shape:
It is fitting that they be used for those abscesses, ulcers, fistulas, and buboes, because within those are the bones and other things.
And those are made round, thick, sharp, like large needles with which saddles are stitched, and they are made of citrus wood, or of wood, or of iron, or of silver.  The best are when they are made of citrus wood.
And the instruments are made of black lead, which is believed to be useful for opening fistulas in the cavity of which there are reflections, that is, to be reflected with their lightness by those reflections.
And they are of three types, for some of them are long, and some others medium, and some others short, according to the amount of the width of the fistula and its constriction.
Shape of the large lead instrument:
Shape of the medium lead instrument:
Shape of the small lead instrument:
The shapes of the hooks are of various types, for some are simply single curved, and these are of three types: large, small, and medium.
And of them are also hooked instruments, and these are of three types.
And of those are hooks having two curves, and these are of three types.
And of them are those having three curves, and these are of three types.
And all of these are necessary in their place.
Shape of a small simple hook, its form:
Shape of a large hook having two curves: Shape of a medium-sized hook having two curves: Shape of a small hook having two curves:
Shape of a large hook having three curves:
Shape of a medium-sized hook having three curves:
And these are the shapes of the scalpels with which the nodes and abscesses are cut and cauterized, and there are three types, namely large, medium, and small.
Shape of a large scalpel:
Shape of a medium-sized scalpel:
Shape of a small scalpel:
The edges with which the incision is made are sharp, and the other edges are blunt, and they are not positioned in such a way as to cause damage during the cauterization of the nodes, to prevent the cutting of a vein or nerve, so that the patient may be healed and experience a little peacefulness due to the burning that occurs near the surface of the abscess.
And these are the shapes of cauteries, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They should be made of iron and resemble a ray, with which alcohol is applied.
And it has a pointed end concealed with a spatula, and it has a channel inside and out, so you can direct it as you see fit.
The shapes of spatulas, which are hidden between the fingers near the openings of abscesses so that the patients do not perceive them, are of three types: large, medium, and small. And these are the shapes of those:
The shapes of cupping glasses, with which the flow of blood is drawn, are of three types: large, medium, and small; their shapes are:
They are made of citrus wood, round with some length, and they are thin.
And it is necessary that these types of cupping glasses, large, medium, and small, be present so that through them the flow of blood is drawn quickly when needed, and then when initially not medicine.
However, do not use them to draw blood from every part of the body, but only on fleshy areas, such as the muscles of the legs and thighs, the muscles of the arms, breasts, abdomen, and knees, and similar fleshy and moist areas.
And sometimes other small instruments are made from these, resembling thin skins of bladders, according to this form; with which blood is drawn when performed by phlebotomy, or from incision of a vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round, according to this form:
Chapter 47.
Concerning the treatment of male breasts that have become enlarged like those of women.
Sometimes, the breasts of some men become swollen during sleep, as they start to grow hairy, and the breasts swell, resembling those of women, and become inflamed, painful.
And for whoever observes this, it is necessary to cut those (breasts) with a lunar incision according to this shape, from line B to line G, and then scrape off all the swelling, and then fill the wound with a flesh-healing medicament, and then stitch the two edges of the wound together, and treat it until it is healed.
However, if the breast descends and is softened by its size, just like those of women, then it should be split into two equal halves, with two crescent-shaped incisions, each contained within the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller, according to this shape, from line B to line G.  Then scrape off the inflamed area between the two edges of the wound, remove the excess fat, and administer the remedies previously mentioned for suturing and powders, as necessary for the healing process, until healed.
And if you do not complete the incision needed due to the patient's distress or bleeding, then fill the wound with cotton soaked in a corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes away the remaining fat, and then treat it until healed.
Chapter 48.
Concerning the opening of abscesses that arise beneath the skin.
These abscesses that arise beneath the skin are a type of scrofulous, hard swelling, containing a membrane-like sac.
And some of these contain moisture; those containing moisture should be incised with a crescent-shaped cut following this figure: from line G to line B. And when all the pus from the abscess has been evacuated, then you should cover it with old cloth and leave it until the next day.
And then the cloth should be removed and the area treated with a suitable ointment until healed.
And if the abscess is of the type found in nodes or scrofulous swellings, then you should make an incision there just as we have described in the section on scrofulous swellings.
If the ulcer has spread so that it might break open, then apply a cautery to it as previously described.
Chapter 49.
Of the incision of abscesses occurring from arrow wounds or vein wounds.
When an arrow wound is inflicted, and the surrounding tissue is consolidated, abscesses often occur.  And the signs by which one knows that the inflammation and abscess are from the artery or vein are: for when an abscess is from an arrow wound, it is long and extended along the course of the body; and when you press on the abscess with your fingers, you feel a rattling sound there.
And that which is from a vein wound is round and visible on the body's surface.
And an incision on this abscess is a mistake, and especially in those located under the armpits, and in the knees, neck, and many other places on the body; and it is quite large, therefore its treatment with iron should be avoided, and that which is on the limbs or head should be avoided.
But on that caused by inflammation from the wound of the arrow, make an incision along the surrounding tissue; then open the incision with hooks and,  alongside the arrow, free it from the tissues until it is exposed.
Then insert a needle there and push it through to the other side, and tighten the arrow with a double-folded thread in two places—which I show to you in the extraction of two arrows that are lodged in the temples.
And then prick the area between the two ligaments with a lancet until all the blood present is released, and the abscess is dissolved.
And then administer treatment to the area where pus has formed until the ligaments fall away; and then treat it with suitable ointments until it is healed.
And if it is an abscess caused by a vein cut, then you should hold with your hand what you can of the abscess with the surrounding tissue, and then insert the needle below the area you held under your hand, and have it penetrate; and put a double thread through it so you extract it from the other side, and then tie the abscess with a bandage according to what I have told you on the grapevine bandage of two parts with two ends of the thread.
But if you fear pulling out the thread, then insert the thread with the needle under the entire abscess below the incision of the first needle, and tie your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in the middle of it until what's inside comes out; then you cut the excess surrounding tissue, and leave what's bound to it.
Then place powder, which you have submerged in wine and oil, over it, and then administer the treatment made with herbs and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1 of the abscess that arises from a nerve twisting.
Thus, as abscesses arise in arteries and veins, similarly abscesses arise in nerves when they are injured by blows or excessive exertion, and by similar causes.
And it [the abscess] is most often found in the areas of the joints or the heel, or in any place where the joints are inflamed.
And it is a serious abscess, and its color is similar to that of the other parts of the body, and it occurs in the most prominent locations, without noticeable pain, and when it is severe, it causes the patient a feeling of numbness.
And it is not an abscess that spreads through the body, and therefore it is confined to the affected area, and it is inflamed in every direction, but does not spread to the areas in front or behind it.
Therefore, those abscesses that are in the joints should not be lanced with an iron instrument, for this would quickly lead to contraction.
However, those that are on the head or forehead should be lanced with a spatula. But if the abscess is small, then use scissors and cut it out at the root.
And if it is large, then lift it with forceps, scrape it, and then remove it; and close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Of the incision of an abscess that occurs in the area of the abdomen.
Many times, in the abdomens of some people and in other parts of their bodies, growths appear that are called "fungal" due to their resemblance to fungi.  Their roots are thin, and their heads are large; and the edges of these growths are turned inwards, some are small, and some are greatly enlarged.
And I have seen one, and in his abdomen were two growths that resembled fungi even more, and there was no difference between them, white and with fine roots.
And the edges of those were inverted and split open, and moisture flowed from it constantly.
Therefore, I incised them and found in one a pus of eighteen ounces and the other of six ounces.
And the procedure for their incision is that you should consider whether the patient is humid, and the color of the growth is white, moist, with fine roots; then you should cut it with a broad spatula, and have cauteries in the fire nearby, because often, when you cut it, a lot of blood is expelled; and if you encounter blood, cauterize that area.
And if the patient is fearful and trembling, beware of incision with iron; but then take fresh lead filings, and compress the growth with that, in the manner we have described; and leave it for two days.
And then adjust the tightness of the lead strip; therefore, do not cease pressing the lead firmly on the growth until it is severed and falls away by itself without effort.
But if the growth has thick roots, then its incision causes some fear and apprehension, especially in the case of one in the abdomen.
But it is possible that you cut half of it, and then cauterize that area so that it does not return.
And then treat that until the wound is healed.
And beware that you do not presume to cut a growth that is dark-colored, with little sensation, and showing little regularity, for such is often cancerous.
And I will bring a remedy for cancer to this.
Chapter 52.
Of the treatment of a protrusion of the navel.
A protrusion of the navel is caused by various factors; either by fissures in the abdominal wall, and it's similar to other ruptures involving the tissues or intestines; or by blood flowing from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned; or by trapped air in the area.
However, if it's due to a fissure in the abdominal wall and the escape of tissue, then the color of the abscess resembles the color of the body; and it is painless, and various in location. And if it's due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its location is significantly different from what we've described, and when you press it with your fingers, it is hidden, and returns; and it is very light to touch, and significantly elevated above the abdominal opening, and intensely painful.
But if it's due to moisture, then it is painless and does not hide when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor does it seem strained.
And if it's due to blood, then the abscess appears with signs of a darkening, tending towards black.
But if it's due to dead flesh, then the abscess is severe, large and hard, and it is embedded within a certain quantity.
But if it's due to flatulence, then the touch of it is painless.
And the operation for it is to consider whether the swelling around the navel is from blood of an arrow wound, or from a vein, or from flatulence; then you must refrain from treating it, because there is danger and fear in such cases, as is shown in the chapter where I discussed abscesses from arrow wounds and from veins.
And if the swelling of the navel is due to the intestine or the mesentery, then order the patient to hold their breath and stand upright; then probe with a probe around the entire navel, and then order them to lie on their back with your hands supporting their hips, and then make a circular incision around the navel in the area you've marked with the probe; and then excise half of the abscess outwards with a large surgical instrument; and then tie off the surrounding area with strong thread or with flax, and perform the ligature appropriately.
And then cut through the middle of the extended abscess over the ligature and insert your finger into that opening and seek the intestine; and if you have located and separated it from the ligature, then carefully extract and push the intestine back into the abdominal cavity.
And if you have found the mesentery, then grasp it with forceps; and cut away the excess of it.
But if it is a wound from an arrow or a vein, then circle the area around that spot and then return to your surgical procedure; and take two needles and thread them with strong threads, and insert the two needles in the circular incisions around the abscess in a cross-like manner, piercing through them; and then divide the abscess into four sections over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and allow the spread flesh to remain until it can fall off on its own; or cut it away when it is softened and can be detached, and then treat that area with appropriate medicaments until it is healed.
And if the swelling of the navel is from flesh that has grown there or from moisture, then it is necessary for you to drain the abscess as we have described, and remove the blood or moisture that you find there, and then treat the area with appropriate remedies to consolidate it.
Chapter 53.
Concerning the treatment of cancer.
We have already discussed, in the division, the types of cancer and the methods of treating it with medicine, and that cauterization is inadvisable because it does not heal the ulcer; and we have discussed cancer originating in the breast and the precautions for its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a location where it is possible to remove it, just as with cancer on the breasts or in the thigh, and similar locations on the limbs, removing everything, especially when it is small and just beginning.
However, when it is old and severe, it is not appropriate to apply oneself to it, for I cannot cure any of this nor have I seen another who has achieved this.
And the operation, when it is located as we have said, is that you should proceed, and leave the patient, and purge them of black bile sometimes, and then bleed them, if a clear fullness is found.
And then prepare the patient with preparations appropriate to the operation, and then insert hooks into the opening, which are appropriate for it; and then hollow out everything around with a suitable, sharp instrument until no trace of the roots of the cancer remains. And allow the blood to flow, and do not cut it lightly, and squeeze the areas, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand or with any instrument available to you.
However, if you encounter difficulty with thick blood, from a vein or an artery, then cauterize it until the flow of blood stops, and then treat it with further treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 145.
Of the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, the types of dropsy caused by water, and the signs of each type, and the treatment of them with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the type of "althitas" alone, and it is not appropriate to use iron for the type of "timpanistres" or the type of "yposarcha", for that is fatal.
And when you have treated this type of tympanistres dropsy with medicines, and your treatment does not improve, then consider that if the patient is already weakened, or has another illness, or another type of dropsy, such as in their lungs or abdomen and similar conditions, then be careful not to treat it with iron, for there is danger in that.
But if you observe the patient with exuberant strength, and there is no other illness but dropsy alone, and the patient is neither a child nor an old person, then the method for operating on them is to lift the patient up between your hands, and have an attendant press the patient's stomach with their hand, pushing the water towards the lower part of the abdomen, and then take a spiny sponge in this manner:
It should be of two sharp parts, long, with a sharp extremity like a sponge; but nevertheless, there should be some small shortness in the middle, so that during the operation with it you do not pierce the intestine and injure it.
And then consider if the dropsy's origin is from the intestines, because then you should, with the incision, move away from the navel by about three fingers towards the lower parts, on the right side above the abdomen.
But if the dropsy's origin is from a liver ailment, then your incision should be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its origin is from the spleen, then your incision should be on the right side.
And your incision should not be on the side on which the patient is lying, lest the excess fluids flow to that constricted area.
And then pierce the entire membrane with the instrument, and then insert it into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the membrane and the skin, and scrape that away; and if it is the thickness of a fingernail or thereabouts.
And then pierce the skin until the spatula reaches the empty space, which is the place of the water. And then extract that and insert an instrument of this shape: and it is similar to a fine silver cannula; it is made of silver or brass or tin, on the lower part of which is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes: two on one side and one on the other side; and its tip is cut in the manner of a pen, like this:
And at its highest point is a little ring; for when the instrument reaches the water, then that immediately rests on the instrument, thus evacuating a moderate amount of the water; for if you evacuate more than is appropriate at the time, the patient will likely die from the dissolution of their animal spirit, or bring about an immediate death.
But evacuate that according to its potency and according to what the patient's condition, the pulse's strength, and their overall well-being indicate to you.
And then remove the instrument, and retain the water.  This is because as soon as it is retained by the string which holds the hole that is on the top of the [container], which I remind you to perforate in that way.
And then repeat the process on another day, if the patient tolerates it, and extract a small amount of water.  Do this over several days with caution, and be wary of errors until only a little water remains.
However, if you fear for the patient, and leave a large quantity of water, then cure that with burial in hot sand, and induce sweating in a bath, and expose to the sun for a long time; and treat it with drying medicines until healed.
And cauterize the stomach, spleen, and liver near the extraction of the water, according to what I have previously described.
Chapter 55.
Of the treatment of children who are born in places where the urinary tract is not perforated.
Sometimes, one of the children is born from its mother's womb and the opening of its passage is not perforated (or is a narrow opening or is not in its proper place).
Therefore, it is necessary to treat it with a perforation as soon as it is born, using very fine instruments according to this method:
And then place a small lead peg in the opening, and secure it, and leave it in place for three days or four.
And when it wishes to urinate, it will be released and will urinate; and then return it to its proper place.
And if you do not place the lead [peg], it is possible that the urine which flows over the area will prevent the opening from closing.
But that of which the opening is narrow must be treated with a lead peg, as we have said, for many days until it is widened.
But those in which the opening is not in its proper place, as mentioned, whose cause is for one reason or another, that which is born in the opening being at the end of the penis' head, so that it cannot urinate in the proper parts, until he lifts the penis with his hand upwards; and it is not in its proper position, so that the sperm cannot reach the mother in a straight path, and is a very protracted illness.
And the method of the operation in this case is that the patient be placed on their back, and then, using your left hand, pull the head of the penis forcefully outward, and cut the head of the penis at the opening of the foreskin with a sharp scalpel, as if cutting a feather, or any part you cut, so that the middle of the penis is like the head of the penis and the opening falls into its proper position as needed.
And be careful that in your surgical procedures concerning blood flow, because many times this happens; and stop it with what you use to cut the blood, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter 56.
Of the whitening that occurs in the foreskin on the head of the penis, and of the corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis.
Many times this whitening occurs in the penis, and it is an eminence of loose flesh.
And of that, one is malignant and the other is non-malignant.
For the non-malignant one, you should suspend it with a fine thread and excise the affected area until it is all cleared; then place a compress soaked in Egyptian unguent on that spot; then treat it with diafhinicon unguent until it is healed.
And if the whitening is malignant, of a leathery color, then you must apply cautery near its incision and its root.
But if the whitening is on the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis, and one part of the whitening is inside the foreskin and the other part is outside, then you must remove the whitening that is inside at the beginning until it is consolidated; and then you treat the outside part, because when you treat both simultaneously, there is no guarantee that it won't be torn.
And if you see blackness and corruption in the genitals and foreskin, then you must remove all that which is already blackened and about to corrupt, or that which is already corrupt; and then apply to that a mixture of honey, crushed pomegranate bark, and pounded and sifted herbs.
And then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
But if there is an excessive flow of blood, then apply a lunar cautery according to this method:
Because a beneficial cautery is for two purposes simultaneously, that is, for excessive blood flow and for a plague when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is completely corroded and destroyed at once, then you must insert a lead cannula into the foreskin opening so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adherence of the foreskin to the head of the penis (and this adherence occurs only in those whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required; and when adherence occurs due to a plague or abscess), you must scrape with a blunt spatula until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the penis is completely released.
And if it is difficult to distinguish them precisely, then you must scrape away any cause of adherence between the head of the penis and the foreskin, and this is because the foreskin, when thin, is easily pierced by its own thinness.
And then carefully separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with thin strips of cloth, which have already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
And then treat it with astringent wine until it is healed.
Chapter 57.
Concerning the cleansing of children and the treatment of complications arising from circumcision.
Circumcision is not a simple break in the skin like other wounds; however, since it is a procedure we perform and one that is specifically for children, it is necessary to devise the best and easiest method of treatment to promote healing.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not describe circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws.  This is only because, through experience, we have found that most craftsmen and barbers use circumcision and cleansing with a small knife and forceps; and they use a bandage with wool and incision with the fingernail.
And I have already tested all these methods, and I find no better cleansing than with scissors, and a bandage with wool, than cleansing with the fingernail.  For often the foreskin peels back further because the foreskin has two layers, and the inner layer remains, and it is easily forced to another incision, causing further pain and discomfort. And with the cleansing done by a method using a type of scraping tool, and done digitally, which shoemakers use, the incision on the tip of the male member is not reliably made, because it easily slips into the opening of the member.
But in the operation using a fingernail, it easily slips and damages your operation. And the foreskin of the child is naturally short, and often born in such a way that it needs no cleansing, and I have seen that.
But the cleansing done with scissors and a bandage of wool, its goodness, experience has shown me, because the scissors are for a proportional incision, because the sharpness above is as sharp as that below;  and therefore, when you press your hand there, you have a proportionate double sharpness, and it cuts in a way that is comparable in one motion.  And a compression of the wool is applied in a way that encloses the foreskin of the penis from every side, and with it, there's no possibility of any error at all.
And the first method of the operation is that you should position the child, especially if it's one that understands a little, so that you only bind the wool around its penis and leave it there until the next day.
And then make it joyful in whatever way is possible for it, based on what its intelligence receives. And then position it between your hands, carefully, and let nothing be visible; and conceal the scissors in your hand, or under your foot, so that the child does not see them or any other instruments.
And then place your hand on its penis, and blow into the foreskin, and pull it back so that the head of the penis is exposed, and then clean it from any adhering dirt.
The shape of the scissors for cleaning/cauterization, this is the shape:
One end should be blunt, and the other sharp, so that the shank of the nail doesn't come out, and the length of the two blades should be as long as two handles together.
But the mistake in cleaning/cauterization is when you forcefully pull the foreskin completely, or part of it, away from the incision.
Therefore, you must stretch that with your finger beforehand, before opening the abscess, and cut it evenly.
And if you cannot hold it with your finger, then pull it out with forceps and cut it.
However, if three days have passed, and that which is swollen beneath the penis remains abscessed, then you should let it be until the abscess has subsided and gently open it, and cut it according to what is prepared for you.
And beware of the head of the penis, for that will not help him.
And then heal it with that which consolidates the wound from the powders which we have recounted in the treatise on powders.
And if it is cut from the cord excessively, and you treat the upper parts, that will not help him.
And further treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
Of the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by blockage, either by stone or by congealed blood, or by pus or by flesh (meat), and similar to those things we have described in the division on treatments.
And if, despite what we have said, the blockage is severe, then you must administer extraction with an instrument called a syringe, which is formed as follows: It should be made of silver, thin and hollow, like a bird's quill, with a fine pointed tip about a palm and a half in length, and with a thin tube at its head.
And the method of drawing out the urine with this is to take a folded cloth and tie wool or cotton to one end for a good grip;  insert the folded cloth end into the lower part of the syringe, and if any excess wool is present, cut it off with scissors, but insert the end firmly into the tube with force. Then lubricate the syringe with oil and egg white.
And have the patient lie on their back, and anoint the bladder and penis with moist ointments, olive oil and herbs.
And then insert the syringe easily until it reaches the base of the penis; then bend the penis upward toward the navel; then push the syringe inside that; then push it further until it reaches the bladder.  And in doing so, the patient is thus cured of the blockage.  If this method doesn't work, then it must be the narrow meatus, which is tortuous.
And then slowly pull out the cloth with the wool, little by little, for the urine will soak the wool.
Then extract it and use it for urinary treatment; use the syringe repeatedly until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter 59.
Of the quality of bladder irrigations using a clamp, and similar instruments appropriate for this purpose.
When ulcers or abscesses occur in the bladder, or congealed blood, or a narrowing/obstruction is present, and you want to instill water and medicine into it, then use an instrument called a clamp, and this is its form:
but instead its end is sealed, that is closed. And in that are three openings: two on one side, just like a V.
At the beginning is a hollow space, in which what is pushed in resides, and be according to the quantity that clogs it, without addition, so that when any cause draws it away from the humors, it is drawn away, and when it is expelled, with this is drawn away, and when it is expelled far, just as a clamp with which naphtha is inserted in naval battles.
Therefore, when you want to introduce moisture into the bladder, insert the end of the clamp into the moisture, and pull with it what is pushed towards the upper parts, for the moisture is drawn into the cavity of the clamp.
And then insert the end of the clamp into the penis as we have described in the procedure; and then push the moisture with what you are pushing, for that moisture will reach the bladder immediately, and the patient will feel relief.
Shape of the subtle instrument with which the bladder is drained, and this is the form:
And it should be made of silver or lead, of which the highest part of the head should resemble a small feather, and below it a tube within the ligament.
And then take a bladder, place in it the moisture you want to drain from the bladder, and then bind it between two things with a strong double-string bandage, and heat that moisture over the fire.
And then insert the tip of the instrument into the penis.
And then press your hand firmly on the bladder with the moisture until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; and pierce it all the way through; and then insert strong string into those holes, tightly tied; and then shape the circle so that it is like a strainer, and place on it the moisture, oils, and waters you want to drain.
And then you attach that to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, and squeeze with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
Of the extraction of stones.
We have already discussed in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and stones formed in the bladder, and the signs of each.
And we have discussed the stones in which manual operation and incision are necessary.
And the stone formed in the bladder is properly that which is located within the bladder.
And I am narrating this with clear exposition and brevity.
Therefore, I say that stones formed in the bladder mostly affect children; and among the signs of this are that the urine passing from the bladder is similar to water in its thinness, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs their penis, and often groans, and is often bent over; and with this, the anus is often constricted in these cases.
And the cure is easier for children up to fourteen years of age; and the cure is difficult for the elderly. But in young people, it is more manageable because it is among them. (Or:  But in young people, it is more manageable because it is contained within them.)
And in the case where the stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, it is the opposite.
Therefore, to arrive at a cure for this, it is necessary at the beginning to cleanse the patient with a clyster which removes all the feces in their bowels; for that blockage sometimes hinders the expulsion of the stone from the body.
And then the patient should be placed with their feet raised and gently massaged from below so that the stone descends to the bladder area or, in some cases, jumps from its position.
And then make this incision (or procedure) between your hands, and the patient's hands should be positioned under their thighs, so that the entire bladder is positioned to slope downwards.
And then remove that (the stone) and all the rest (of the material) from there.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then you immediately cut around it.
And if it doesn't completely descend through your manipulation, then you should lubricate your left index finger (if the patient is a child) or middle finger (if the patient is a fully grown person) with oil and insert it into their anus. And push the stone until it is below your finger. And move it slowly until it reaches the neck of the bladder.
And then press on it with your finger, and expel it to the outside of the area where you extracted it.
And instruct the assistant to press on the bladder with their hand; and instruct another assistant to use their right hand to pull the genitals upwards, and with their other hand to hold the penis (or scrotum - depending on the context of *codena*) which is below the genitals, at the point of the incision.
And then, insert the instrument properly, the shape of which is as follows: And cut through the flesh between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle, but towards the left thigh; and let the incision be made on that stone, and your finger be in the anus, and let a transverse incision be made, so that the external incision is wide and the internal one narrow, according to the amount of protrusion of the stone that's possible, and not larger, for if you strongly press your finger in the anus, the stone will be pressed towards the incision, and it will be ejected without difficulty.
And know that there is some stone in it, with angles and edges, which makes its removal difficult because of this.
And that which is of this stone is like a gland, round, and easily removable.
Therefore, if it is one with angles and edges, it is wedged in the fissure.
And if it is not thus ejected, then it is necessary that you apply pressure upon it, or that you press upon it with a suitable instrument, the end of which is like a file with which you press upon the stone, and do not move it from its place; or that you insert a thin, curved instrument under it.
But if you cannot remove it, then you enlarge the opening a little, and if you see blood flowing, you cut it while pressing it with ground vitriol.
But if the stones are more than one, then initially you push the hand towards the mouth of the bladder, and then cut upon it; and then push a little further; and do likewise if there are more than two.
And if the stone is very large, then it is foolish for you to cut it with a large incision, for you cause the patient one of two things: either death or a continual urine leakage, because the area is not completely healed.
But administer expulsion of it until it is ejected, or apply force to its fracture with forceps until you extract it in pieces.
So, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe juice and dragon's blood, and press it down. And place over it a cloth steeped in oil and wine, or in rubbed oil and cool water, so that a hot abscess may be relieved.
And then lay the patient on their back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
And when you have removed that, embrocate the area with water and oil, and then treat it with diafinicon ointment and diabazilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound a hot, burning, and corrosive abscess develops, and it resembles the blood being congealed in the bladder, obstructing urination (and this is known by the blood appearing in the urine), then insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will cause corruption of the bladder and subsequent putrefaction.
And then wash the wound with sour wine, water, and salt, and with whatever other suitable remedies are appropriate for its treatment until it is healed.
And throughout the entire treatment, you must bind both thighs and apply the medicines that have been placed upon the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the urethral opening, lodged within, and urination is also obstructed, then treat it with what I have previously recommended before resorting to incision, for often one is accused of unnecessary incision for this treatment; and I have personally tested this, and you should take a sharpened iron drill, of which this is its shape:
of triangular tip, sharp, fixed in a shaft.
And then take a bandage, and bind the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
And then insert the iron into the penis, piercing easily until the drill reaches that stone. And you turn the drill with your hand on that small stone bit by bit, and you enlarge the hole until you cause the other end to penetrate; for the urine will be released immediately.
And then press your hand on what remains of the stone on the external side of the penis, for that is broken and is forced out with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment is not suitable for you for some reason which prevents it, then bind a bandage under the stone and another bandage over the stone. And then cut onto the stone in that penis between the two bandages. And then remove that. And then loosen the bandage and clean the congealed blood, which is formed in the wound.
And a bandage under the stone is not necessary, except to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other bandage on top is not necessary either; for when the bandage is loosened next to the stone's evacuation, the stone returns to its place and heals the wound.
And therefore, when you bind the bandage on top, it is necessary for you to lift the stone to the parts above, or that it returns to your completion, and the wound heals as we have said.
Chapter 61.
Of the extraction of stones from women.
Stones in women are rarely generated.
But if a stone is found in any of them, then the cure is difficult, and it is impeded by many methods.
One of them is because the woman is very young and a virgin.
And the second is that you do not find a woman knowledgeable enough to reveal herself to a doctor when she is chaste, or is one of the women who have husbands.
The third is that you do not find a woman well versed in this art, especially the operation with hands.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision on a stone in women is far from the location of the stone, requiring a deep incision, and there is fear in that.
But if necessity compels you to do this, then you must take a knowledgeable female physician, and such are rarely found.
But if you are deprived of such a woman, then seek a skillful and subtle male physician, or present a matron well-versed in women's ailments, or a woman who has expertise in this art.
Therefore, present her, and command her to do everything you tell her, from the initial examination of the stone; this is to determine if the woman is a virgin, in which case she must insert her finger into the woman's vagina and seek out the stone.
Therefore, if she finds it, she should grasp it under her finger, and then command her to make an incision on it.
But if she is not a virgin, then command the matron to insert her finger into the woman's vagina and search for the stone, while placing her left hand over the bladder, and applying firm pressure.
Therefore, if she finds it, she must gradually pull it from the bladder opening to the lower regions, by use of her skill until she reaches the root of the thigh.
Then make an incision at the junction of the vagina near the thigh root, wherever the stone is lodged, and hold the stone in that area, ensuring the finger doesn't release the stone from the grasped position.
And the incision should be shallow at first; then insert the instrument into that incision, and if she feels the stone, she should widen the incision according to the size necessary to remove the stone.
And know that the types of stones are various: some are small and large, some sharp and rough, some long and round, and some with protuberances.
So you know how many types there are, so that you can specify what you want.
And if you see a flow of blood, apply powdered vitriol to the area and leave it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then resume your procedure until the stone is expelled.
And ensure you prepare the instruments necessary for removing stones in men, so that you are assisted in your procedure.
And if you see blood flowing, and know that the bleeding is from an incised artery, then you should apply powder to the area and compress it with bandages and tight dressings.  Do not repeat this; leave the stone and do not remove it, for the patient will likely die from this. And then treat the wound.
Therefore, when the bleeding has subsided after a few days, and the area has healed, then you should resume your procedure until the stone is expelled.
Chapter 62.
Of surgery on a strangulated hernia.
An acute hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture in the white sac, which is beneath the groin area containing the testicles, and it is called the sac.
And sometimes it is in the proper skin of the scrotum, which nature prepared in the region of the testicle, until it is seen that there is another testicle; and it is the groin region between the white sac that we have mentioned, and this is nothing but a pouch.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness that occurs in the testicles, because this material is released into them, and sometimes it occurs because of a blow inflicted on the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors, for its color is either tending toward yellow or bloody, or red, or black and foul-smelling, or watery and white, and this is what mostly happens.
And the signs by which it is known where this collection of water is are these: for if it is in the white sac that we have mentioned, then the swelling is round, sloping slightly lengthwise, like the shape of an egg, and the testicle appears, because the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
And if the moisture is in the proper skin of the scrotum, then the swelling is round with a part resembling the testicle, and for this reason one believes it to be another testicle.
And if the moisture is between the fold of the testicles and the white sac, then it will feel like a lump below.
And if you wish to know the color of the moisture, then you should test the color of the moisture in the swelling with a slender probe whose shape is known beforehand; and according to what comes out on the probe, judge what is inside.
Therefore, when we come to treating it with iron, it is necessary to instruct the patient to be bled, if possible, and to see if their body is full.
And afterward, let him lie on his back on something slightly elevated, and place soft cloths beneath him.
And then, sit on the patient's left side, and instruct the attendant to sit on the right side, extending their staff to one of two places: the crease of the testicles and the area near the navel of the abdomen.
And then, take a broad spatula and split the crease of the testicles lengthwise from the middle to near the pubic bone.
And let the incision be made along a straight line equidistant from the line that would cut the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white scrotum encompassing it.
And scrape that area, observe it, and be careful not to cut it; and the scraping you perform should only be done gently and subtly with the lightest possible scraping, according to the quantity that is feasible for you.
And then pierce the water-filled scrotum with a wide opening, and extract all the water.
And then separate the two lips of the incision with forceps, and extend the scrotum outward; do not touch the crease of the testicles, and cut the scrotum in whatever way is possible for you. And cut it entirely or in pieces, paying particular attention to its thin edges, for if you do not carefully examine the incision, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.
However, if the testicle protrudes from its pouch during your procedure, then after completing the incision in the scrotum, return it inside, and then stitch the two edges of the scrotum's pouch with sutures, and then treat it like other wounds until it heals.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another illness, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels which are on the supporting structure, remove the testicle, and then treat it as we have described.
But if the fluid is collected in two separate areas, for example, know that there are two hernias; therefore, cut that area as you did the other hernia; and if it seems to you to be one operation, then perform it as one.
And then you should clean away the blood, and in between the incisions place wool soaked in oil or oil mixed with something else; then place another layer of wool soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the genitals and the belly area; and place over it folded cloths and powders, and bind them together with a bandage in this way:
And then take two cloths and fill them with wool, prepared in this manner; and have their ends bound with cotton or damp wool, and attach them with a bandage to the bracers of the breeches, and one end should reach from the buttocks to the groin, and the other end reach to the thigh area, and two ends on the lower thighs, and two other ends on the knees, and all the bandages should be fastened at the bracers of the breeches.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with a cautery instead of cutting with an iron.  This means that you should take a sharp, knife-like cautery iron and cut through the skin of the genitals with it, and heat it as we have described until the white cyst containing the fluid is exposed.  Then you should take a cautery iron in this shape: And it resembles a Greek letter.
And then pierce through that cyst, and heat it until all the moisture is expelled.
And then pull the cyst open with hooks, and scrape it with hooks, and scrape it with a heated, sharp cautery; and cut it as best you can until it is removed; and be careful that the fire doesn't burn it.
And know that this operation is safer and less prone to bleeding, and better than an operation with cutting.
However, if you encounter an abscess during the incision or cauterization, or bleeding, then you must treat whatever difficulty arises with a treatment appropriate to it, as previously described.
But if the patient is weak, and cannot tolerate the second operation because of its difficulty, then administer a puncture as I recommend; and this is when you are certain, from what we have said about the signs, that the hernia is acute.
Then you must have the patient sit on a raised stool, then puncture the abscess in the lowest part of the body with a sharp instrument, and make the puncture along the length of the body.
And let the opening be wide enough so that all the water drains out.
And then place a cloth over the area, bandage it, and leave it, so that the remaining water drains out. And then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the outflow of water at that time, you puncture it: and this is done only because the white membrane in the wound's opening causes resistance and prevents the water from escaping.  Then you must place a poultice or instrument, similar to those used to remove water from dropsy (as described earlier), on the wound, or gently compress the wound.
And know that the water returns, and is collected again approximately every six months or thereabouts; and when it is collected, it should be punctured in the same manner, for the patient will thus pass their days.
Chapter 63.
Of the incision on a fleshy hernia and its cure.
Know that in the incision of this hernia, there is a fear of death in the most serious cases; therefore, I have observed the release of it and its being saved by this method.
And I remember the operation on this and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses arise in the bodies of those whose humors are concentrated, and this is caused by many things: either by an acute, severe superfluity, which is poured into the humors, or by a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it, and it is a serious abscess.
And a hardened abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it, is very serious.
And sometimes it is caused by the knotting of arteries, and by the swelling of those, as is already perceived in the memory of it, or by swelling of the veins.
But that which is caused by the swelling of arteries is recognized by the dispersal of the abscess when you compress it with your fingers; and it is not appropriate for it to be touched.
However, that which is caused by the swelling of a vein is not dispersed by any means due to compression with the fingers.
And it is possible that on this type [of abscess] a section can be made, and on the other flesh; and that you should incise the skin of the genitals, and then spread the sack outwards, and extract that from the white sack, and free the ligaments of the vessels, and tie them, and cut the ligaments further once you have freed it completely from all parts of the sack.
Therefore, if the sack is already with those hardened tissues, then it is necessary that you extract the sack and cut it.
And if there is adhesion to any part of the sack, or between the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the location of the adhesion, which is behind, then it is necessary that you cut all that which is from it, and extract the sack just as we have said.
Therefore, when your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool steeped in olive oil and wine; and then treat that with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
Of the treatment of an inguinal hernia.
A hernia is an abscess surrounded by a swelling similar to a bud, with softening of the testicles.  It makes difficult movement, exercise, and walking for the patient.
And in the treatment of this ailment, fear for what precedes it is a consideration.
However, we must describe the procedure in the same way as the first.
And I say that it is necessary to have the patient sit on a raised stool; then, pull down the suspensory ligament of the testicles; then, hold the scrotum with your fingers, along with the vessels that surround the penis; and have another assistant do the same, and extend it with forceful extension.
Then, with a sharp, broad knife, make a transverse incision along the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
And then scrape away everything, just as we have described in the extraction of arrowheads from the temples.
And then insert a needle with a double point into those places where you have encountered the vit (presumably a vessel or similar anatomical feature), and tie it once at the beginning of the location, and tie it again at the end. Then, cut them (referring to the previously tied structures) in the middle, with a straight incision along the length of the body, and remove the accumulated fetid and corrupted humors.
Then treat the wound as you would treat other wounds where you want pus to be generated, so that the vessels which nourished one of the two genes (perhaps referring to a part of the body) are broken, for this is not harmful.
However, if you encounter vessels on all sides, then it is necessary to remove the testicles or for the testicles to become blocked by the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nourishment due to the incision of the vessels, and that they become withered, or blocked so that they are not nourished by them.
Chapter 65.
Concerning the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a rupture that develops in the extended diaphragm over the abdomen, by some of the intestines of the abdominal cavity being pushed through the rupture.
And this rupture is either of the diaphragm or a rupture in it, and these two types occur due to many causes: either a blow, or a fall, or a cry, or the lifting of some heavy object, or similar events.
And the sign of this, when it is due to a stretching of the diaphragm, is that it occurs gradually over a long period, and not suddenly, and it is a swelling that gradually moves towards the navel, because the diaphragm is pressing the intestine.
And the sign of it, when it is due to a rupture of the diaphragm, is that initially it causes sudden, intense pain; and there is a diverse swelling appearing under the nearest ribcage, and this is due to the intestine being pushed out, and the body of the intestine is on the outside of the diaphragm.
And sometimes the intestine is pushed out with a part of the membrane/tissue, and this is called a strangulated intestinal hernia.
And sometimes it is caused by wind, and sometimes a tear develops in the intestine, and it is trapped there, and this causes great harm to the patient, and sometimes it causes wicked pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of the species of this illness with iron there is fear, for which it is necessary to avoid using that method in this case.
And the way to perform the operation is to instruct the patient to push the intestine back into its cavity with their hand if it is possible to return it, and then place it over their abdomen between your hands, and elevate their legs.
And then extend the sheath, which is the sheath of the testicles, upwards, and cut the sheath of the testicles entirely lengthwise; and then insert two blades of the scalpel into the cut according to your need to open the incision with them.
And if the incision, according to the amount that is possible for you, allows the testicle to be removed.
And then scrape away the tissue that is beneath the testicle sheath, until the hard white tissue of each part is exposed.
Then you insert your finger into the area surrounding the testicle, the area between the white tissue that is beneath the testicle's sheath, and the surrounding tissue, and separate any adhesion that is on the back side of the testicle.
Then hold the testicle sheath with your hand outward, and with this, pull the white tissue upward with your left hand, and lift the testicle with the tissue toward the incision; and command the assistant to pull the testicle upwards, and you detach any adhesion on the back with a suitable solution.
And check with your fingers that there is no cause for the intestine to be wrapped within the hard white tissue. But if you find any such cause, then you push it back into the abdomen.
Then cut into the area below the sheath of the testicles, so that blood and pus flow out, as we have described previously in what we have said.
Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound; and apply the bandage as described (and sometimes the white tissue is cauterized, which we mentioned near the incision to prevent blood flow, because it frequently happens).  Leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
However, if the swelling is delayed, then warm water should be applied, and left on it until it falls off, as we have said.
And then treat the wound with other methods for treating wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Of windy hernia.
In this hernia, I have not seen anything that has been burnt with iron for its treatment.
And the first [doctors] said that it is done thus, as we have recounted for the hernia that is with wine; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision, gently; and then cauterize the middle area around the abscess with whatever opens that, until the vessels fall.
And treat the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the disruption that occurs in the joints.
Sometimes there is a rupture in the joints, as we have said, and you should remove the area [of the injury/problem].
And do not allow any cause of the intestines to remain in the groin; and if they do, it is little; and it returns at any hour.
However, if the time is prolonged with this, a fracture in the hip is likely until the intestine descends into the hip; and this happens due to the extension of the hip joint, as we have said, because the hip is stretched and then softened, and the area becomes suppurated and is removed.
And the cure for it is with cautery, as is preceded by the narration of it.
And sometimes it is cured with an iron according to this method: and it is that the patient lies on their back between your hands, and then dry the area of the rupture of the abscesses removed by sectioning across the width according to the quantity of three days.
And then pull the white hip that is under the rib cage until it is uncovered.
And then take the ray (likely a surgical instrument) and place it on the prominent area of the hip, and press it against the abdominal wall.
And then stitch the two prominent locations on the hip's end of the ray, and join one of them to the other with sutures.
And then remove the end of the ray, and do not sever the hip completely, nor extend the wound, nor any other such thing as I have instructed you in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then treat that with the treatment for ulcers, and as you would dress wounds, clean it and restore the ulcer until it is healed; for the hip is contracted and the rupture's prominence is not adjusted.
And cauterization is better in this location, for it is closer to health.
Chapter 68.
Of softening the hardness of the testicles.
Often the hardness of the testicles in some men is softened because the tissues surrounding them are softened, and it is trustworthy to observe this.
Therefore, it is necessary for whoever is tasked with the cure to have the patient lie down in the appropriate position, and gently separate all the hardened tissue from the natural tissue; and then to bring the two edges together with stitches.
And if you wish, stitch the excess of softened tissue at the beginning with three or four firm stitches.
And then make incisions between the stitches; and then treat with remedies for other wounds until it is healed and the pus comes out.
Chapter 69.
Of castration.
Know that castration, in our law, is forbidden, but it is permissible for me to mention it in this book because of two reasons. The first is for the knowledge of the physician when questioned about it, so that he may know the treatment for those who suffer it. The second reason is that we often need to castrate other animals for our own benefit, such as oxen, goats, pigs, and similar beasts.
And therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: either by crushing, or by slitting or cutting.
But in that which is done by crushing, the method is to immerse the beast in hot water until its genitals are softened and relaxed, and hang down. And then grasp them with your hand until they are broken and no longer appear below the touch.
But in castration done by slitting and cutting, you must hold the beast and press the scrotum with your left hand.
And then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut into each testicle with a cut until both testicles are separated.
And then cut them further, after you have each peeled them. And do not leave on those of the scrotum any cause, but only the subtle scrotum which is over the veins.
And this method of castration, which is done by attrition, is better, for strong attrition leaves no cause in the testicles for the beast to desire mating.
And then treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
Of the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men comes in two ways: one is when there appears in the scrotum area, between the testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, with hair on it.
And sometimes, from that area, urine flows from the scrotum.
But in women, it is a single type: and it is that the vulva of the woman on the pubis appears as if two testicles of a man, somewhat small, are on the outside, in the same way as a man's foreskin and two testicles.
And the cure is of three types: for two types in men and one type in women. And it is necessary that you cut the joined flesh until the pressure is relieved, and then treat it with the cure for other wounds.
And in the second type in men, concerning urine in the scrotum, there is no cure or operation for it.
Chapter 21.
Of swelling and protruding flesh due to female causes.
A slight swelling is connected to natural causes until it is tightened and its care is made easy; and sometimes it becomes so large in some women that it spreads as in men and protrudes until the act of sexual intercourse.
Then you should hold the excess swelling with your hand or forceps and cut it.
And do not overdo the cutting, especially in the area of the root, so that you do not cause a flow of blood.
And then treat it with the treatment for sores until it is healed.
But flesh that is born in the womb of the mother until it fills it, and that has strongly emerged from the parts externally like a tail (and for this reason some earlier ones would call this “tailed disease”); then it is necessary that we cut it as we cut swelling and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
Of the treatment of elephantiasis.
Elephantiasis is when the vagina of a woman is not perforated, or the opening is small. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to an illness that has preceded it, and this is caused either by poorly aligned flesh or by subtle or thick adhesions.
And it is located either in the mother's groin, or in her ribs, or in her highest back, or in her lowest back, and you prohibit cooking, pregnancy, and childbirth, and you strongly prohibit menstruation.
And the diagnosis of this is made by observing the midwife, if the obstruction is apparent, promptly; but if it is not apparent, then you search for it with your fingers or with a probe.
But if the obstruction is due to a thin adhesion, and is close to the two lips, then you should cook and break it apart.
And you should place powders on the two lips, and then place your index fingers from both hands on top.
And the woman should lie on her back, her thighs extended, and then forcefully extend the two lips until that thin adhesion is broken and the obstruction is opened.
And then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area, and let her rest with a man during the day so that the incised area does not heal.
But if the adhesion is thick and dense, then it is necessary that you cut it with a sharp spatula or with a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is due to a clot, then lift that with forceps, and cut it.
And have with you the medicines that stop blood flow without causing harm, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and gum arabic, mixed with egg white.
And then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal too quickly.
And keep that in place for several days, and apply a poultice of flaxseed.
And then it should be treated with another healing treatment until it is healed.
And sometimes accidents happen to the surrounding flesh, and in those cases, it is necessary to make incisions according to this method. But if it is due to a brain abscess, the brain abscess in the head should not be treated with iron in any way.
Chapter 73.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids and of the cutting and red swelling that occurs in the female genitals.
Hemorrhoids are a collection of many veins that continually leak blood; and when these hemorrhoids are old and are causing pain.
And I have already described in the division the types of those [hemorrhoids] and their signs, and will now describe which ones receive treatment and which do not.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids and their pain, when located deep within the body and not apparent to the touch, cannot be treated with iron.
But those which are on the surface of the body, where the touch can feel them, are those that can be cured.
And you must place the woman in a cool place, and then carefully cut them away with scissors or a rough cloth, and cut off those parts with the roots.
And then powder over them the flow of blood from one of the incisive powders without biting, like acacia and similar ones.
And then soak their feet for an hour, and then place that in cool water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then make that soak in a decoction of sumat, and of the bark of pomegranates and quince, and of similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine, and make a plaster with that over their back.
And if the blood is stopped, good; and if not, apply two leeches, and to the breasts without scarification.
And then take wool and soak it in coriander juice, or arnica juice, or  mulberry juice mixed with diluted wine, and apply it to the affected area; and then treat the area with ointments until it is healed.
And treat that until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Of the perforation of a bone injury in the arm.
Many types of abscesses can occur in the arm, such as tumors, bone abscesses, ulcers, hardened swellings, spreading sores, fistulas, hemorrhoids, deep sores, and other abscesses. And I have already described these illnesses and their types, their symptoms, and their treatments in the division.
And it is necessary that I describe in this treatise the specific abscess that appears on the arm, when it is among the abscesses that collect pus, and if you want to know how the operation with iron is performed.
Therefore, you should consider whether the pain of the abscess at its onset is sharp, with percussion, phlegm, and fever, and if there is redness and sensitivity when you touch it, then do not try to pierce it. Treat it with what aids maturation until the severity of the condition subsides.
Then you should lay the woman on a cot with two supports; and have her lean on her two supports and place her feet near the lower part of her abdomen, and have her legs spread, and place her arms beneath her elbows, and bind each one with a suitable bandage.
Then the midwife, standing on the right side, administers the instrument with which the opening in the arm is made, the shape of which will be clear from the procedures to follow.
And when you wish to administer this instrument, you should insert it into the arm of the woman with the shaft, and the part of the instrument that enters the arm should only be the shaft and the handle, and comfort the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the arm's shaft, then you must place powders on the surface of the arm's shaft so that the instrument is prevented from entering the arm's shaft.
And you should place the liquid that flows through the instrument's shaft on the upper side, and the assistant should hold the instrument and turn the liquid until the opening of the arm is made.
And when the discharge appears, and it is touched with the hand and is sticky and wet, then you must dry that area around his head with a linen cloth.
And when the pus has been evacuated, then you should place a piece of cloth soaked in rosemary oil or green oil, in which some astringent has been added, and put the cloth on the affected area on the arm.
And place outside the arm, and over the armpit, a clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And then it should be treated for approximately two days with an ointment suitable for this until it is healed.
And sometimes the arm and the wound are washed in such a way that it is cleansed with water and honey, and then with water in which the root of lily or long-stalked thistle has been boiled, and then it returns to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep within the arm, then you should be prohibited from treating it with iron, but should heal it with what we have discussed in the division [or section].
Chapter 75.
To teach the midwives how to treat living embryos when they develop in a non-natural way.
It is necessary for the midwife to recognize the signs of natural childbirth from the beginning.  This means that when you see the woman pushing from below and yearning to breathe air, and she is relieved by what is upon her during labor, and hastens the birth of the embryo, then know that this birth is in the natural form, with the birth of the embryo occurring above the head, and the afterbirth either hanging or suspended from the navel.
Therefore, when you see these signs, then the abdomen should be compressed so that the embryo descends easily.  For when it descends above its head, it releases the afterbirth, and is freed of excess matter with proper cleansing.
However, if the birth is different—not natural and not commendable—it is when the embryo emerges on its feet, and its body emerges before its head and feet, or its one hand or foot emerges, or its head emerges but a hand or foot or its belly, and strongly turned over its neck.  Such forms are considered unpraiseworthy.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be knowledgeable and subtle in all these matters, and to guard against error and deception.
And I am showing all the forms of these, and what ingenuity is in them so that it may be understood and be established upon them.
When the birth has emerged above its head by natural expulsion, and this is difficult for the woman and is occurring with the woman's strength already weakened, then apply this treatment, or what women use, and evaporate the substance from it with gathered fenugreek and moist oils.
And then the midwife should insert her fingers into the small space and fissure with it the afterbirth, or cut it with her nail until it releases any moisture within it. And press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be treated with a poultice of ptilium and a poultice of fenugreek with cumin.
And then command him, the attendant, to compress her and make her sneeze with warmth; and hold her mouth and nose for an hour, for the fetus will be expelled soon.
And if the two hands of the fetus are expelled at first, then it is necessary that you gently reduce them little by little. But if you do not succeed in the process, then place the woman on a stool and lift her feet up, and then lower the stool towards the ground; and the woman must be held so that she does not fall during the movement.
And if the hands are not returned and the fetus dies, then cut them and extract the remaining parts of the fetus or tie the body to his hand with a cloth and extract it with care, for it will be expelled.
When the fetus is positioned on its feet, then you must push it upwards, and then turn the fetus gently, and then grasp it, and then take one of its feet and gently extend it.
But when it has emerged between the thighs, then you tell him to strain, and make him sneeze with the proper procedure, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled by what we have described, then you gently return the fetus until it resumes its natural position, for it will then be expelled with an easy exit.
And if it is impossible with all that we have described, then take marshmallow and dissolved gum, pound them well in a mortar, and then apply this mixture to the vulva, the lower part of the woman's abdomen. And then apply a poultice in lukewarm water, until the hypochondria (lower ribs/sides) are relieved.
And when the parts below are soothed, then make a fumigation with myrtle and let him inhale it. And when the fumigation has been applied for an hour, then place him on a stool, make him sneeze, hold his mouth, lift him up and gently press the lower part of his abdomen, for the fetus will soon be expelled.
The fetus emerges lengthwise, hanging by one of its hands. If it can be reduced by hand, then do so. But if you cannot reduce it by hand, then lift the woman and let her walk.
And if walking is not possible, then lay her on a bed, and forcefully compress her thighs, and subsequently administer remedies of which I have already spoken about, consisting of mucilages.
And if labor has begun, then have her sit on a stool, then study the reduction of the hand, and gently pull the fetus into its natural position, and make the woman sneeze, and command her to strain until it is expelled.
The fetus is positioned on the mother's pelvis, its hands outstretched, and its face is towards the mother's back. The midwife should grasp the baby's hand and gently and easily turn it.
And when it is properly positioned, then apply to its forehead what we have previously mentioned: oil and mucilages.
Then command her to gently move, and when you have done this, have her sit on a stool and command her to lean to her right side, and then command her to strain; and make her sneeze with condiments. The prepared fetus is positioned on its side.
When the mother is freed from the ordeal in this way, consider this, and then you sever the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is emptied of moisture.
And if the fetus is suspended over the face and neck, then you sever it from the navel, so that it is not retained and dies.
And then push the fetus into the parts within until you place it as is appropriate, and tell the woman to compress herself several times, and the fetus will be expelled easily, if God wills it.
Delivery of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are born frequently, and sometimes three or four, but this is rare and difficult to achieve; but these are things outside nature, and not living things.
And count those, whether they have multiplied, a second time, and separate them by the umbilical cord of each one, and sometimes they are expelled as easily as a single fetus by a natural expulsion, and sometimes this occurs in a manner not worthy of praise, as we have reported.
And if some of them are difficult during delivery and reach the point we've discussed about unnatural figures, then treat them as we have described.
And if the midwife is skillful and does this with ease and subtlety, and with patience, and is ingenious in every way, in accordance with the preparation of the situation for a beneficial outcome.
A recollection of what forms in the womb from embryos and miscarriages.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or even ten are formed in the mother's womb.  It has been verified by me that one woman miscarried six, and another ten, all fully formed.  This cause was determined by the wise physicians' examination.
And all this must be in the knowledge of the midwife, for it is very easy to recognize that small likeness of it, and therefore one must act accordingly.
Chapter 76.
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat the dead fetus using what we have discussed in the division of medicine, and it has not emerged naturally, and you are forced to use manual extraction, then you must consider if the woman is of healthy constitution and not suffering from any of the conditions that might cause concern about her loss.
Then the woman must be positioned on her back on a bed, and her head should be inclined downwards, and her thighs elevated.
And the attendant should hold the woman in place on both sides, or bind her to the bed, so that her body does not move during the extraction of the fetus.
And then, moisten the mother's mouth with moist oils and with mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
And then the midwife should anoint her hand with those oils and mucilages, and then gently insert her hand into the mother, and then search with her hand for the place where she can hook her fingers into the fetus.
And suitable places for this: then consider if the fetus is ready to descend on its head, and then you hook your fingers into its neck, or its head, or its mouth, or its palate, or below its chin, or into its fork, or into the appropriate places on the sides, or below the ribs.
But if the descent is on its feet, then in the perineum, or in the middle of the back.
And it is necessary to hold the fingers with the right hand, and place the curve of the hand in that place that is between the fingers of the left hand, and gently insert the hand and place the fingers in any of those places that we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space.
And then place and hook another finger, or a third if necessary, in order to achieve a drawing motion, and not just a pulling motion according to its own direction.
And it should be moved in every direction, so that its extraction is eased, just as a tooth is eased during its removal.
And it is necessary in the area between them that the stretching be softened; and if any part of it is retained, then it is necessary for the midwife to anoint some of her fingers with oil and introduce these instruments and rotate that which is retained.
Therefore, if the part of the fetus is expelled, then the fingers should be moved to a higher location; and do this until the entire fetus is expelled.
However, if one hand has emerged before the other, and it is not possible to return it by means of the constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it; and then pull it out until the whole is expelled, and cut it either at the wrist or at the elbow.
And thus it is necessary to do the same for the other hand and the two feet.
But if the fetus's head is large, or constriction occurs during delivery, or water is collected around the head, then it is necessary to insert instruments between the bones of the skull and break the head open and remove the water, or to cut that open with an instrument called an "alundat", the form of which will be found with the shapes of other instruments in the chapter immediately following this one.
And similarly, do this if the fetus has a large head naturally: and then it is necessary to cut it with an algematu, or to take it with the alunda as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head is protruding and is constricted towards the fork, then it should be cut open until the moisture within the feet is drained.
But if it is not complicated, nor impeded by delivery, then you cut the head as soon as possible.
And if the lower part of the abdomen is abscessed or hydrops, then you must perforate it until the moisture within it is drained.
But if the fetus is on its feet, then the pull of it is gentle and the direction of it towards the mother's mouth is gentle.
But if it is constricted towards the belly and the feet, then you must remove it with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand, and cut the belly and feet until what is within them is expelled.
But if the other limbs are removed and the head remains, then the midwife should insert her left hand; but if the mother's mouth is open, then she should insert her hand into the space around the air, and search for the head with it, and pull it with the fingers towards the mother's mouth, and then insert a finger, or two fingers, and pull it with them.
And if the mother's mouth is obstructed by a hot abscess that afflicts her, then it should not be treated with harshness; instead, a medicinal application of fatty, moist substances should be administered first. And administer poultices; and keep the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fet (presumably a tumor or similar growth) is on its side, then if possible, it should be cut out; and what we have said about a living fet (i.e., a fetus) should be administered.
And if that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and removed.
And it is necessary that you leave no cause within the second-skin (presumably a membrane or covering).
And when you have completed all your operation, then administer what we have said about the treatment of boils, which occur from the mother (i.e., a similar affliction as that which the mother had).
And if a flow of blood occurs, then immerse in astringent waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have already seen a woman in whose belly a stillborn child was formed, and shortly afterward pregnant again, and a stillborn child was produced again. A long time ago, an abscess occurred near his navel; and it swelled until it was opened, and began to discharge pus.
And I was called to treat him, and medicated him for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Then I applied to him some plaster of strong attraction, and one bone came out of him, and after a few days, another bone came out; and I was very surprised, as there are no bones in the belly.
And then I thought they were bones from the stillborn child.
Then I treated the wound, and removed many bones from him, the woman being in her usual state of health, and she lived in this way for a long time, discharging a small amount of pus.
And I did not consider this strange, but rather that in this lies knowledge and assistance to what the skillful physician administers with his hands for healing.
Of the forms of the instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
Form of vertigo with which the mother is opened:
This is the form of constriction in which the books are bound, to which binding are two twists at the two ends of two cords. However, this twist should be more subtle than a constriction, and should be made either of a reed or of a piece of wood.
And the width of each piece of wood is two fingers, and the thickness of each is one finger, and the length of each is one and a half palms; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood there are two joints of the same wood, which are already fastened, of which the length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mother's mouth, so that it may be opened with those when you turn the two prescribed twists.
Another form similar to that, more subtle and lighter:
Let it be made of reed wood or wood, resembling forceps. However, at its end, there are two additions, just as before, and the length of those additions is about one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the mother with those, then you have the woman lie on the bed with her feet hanging down, opening what is between her thighs. And then open your hand with the instrument, as if using shears, according to the amount you want to open the mouth of the mother, until the midwife does what you want.
The form of vertigo which the ancients described:
A method of propelling with which the fetus is propelled:
A method of binding with which the large head is contained.
And it is similar to forceps, which have teeth at the tip, as is often the case.  Sometimes it is made long, like forceps, in this shape, as is often done, with teeth like the teeth of a saw, with which it is incised and contained. A method of binding lightly/ gently.
A method of grasping/hooking, having a spine/point.
A method of grasping/hooking with two spines/points.
A type of spatula with two ends, with which the head is severed.
A form/arrangement of two wide spatulas.
All those instruments, and the more the types are multiplied and prepared by the artisans, the more easily they are to use and the more esteemed they are by men due to their quantity.
And do not neglect these instruments, whatever they may be, that you have at hand, for the necessity of these is not excusable.
Of the extraction of the afterbirth.
When the afterbirth is retained after delivery, then you should instruct the patient to hold their breath, and then make her/him sneeze with some stimulus, and press your hand on the mouth and nostrils, and if by this it is expelled, well and good.
And if not, then take a bowl and pierce a hole in the cover, and place in it herbs that open the mouth of the mother, such as balm, rue, anise, chamomile, Arabic cicadas, cinnamon, and St. John's Wort. All these herbs, or some of them, should be immersed in water in the bowl, and place that over the fire.
And then place a reed tube in the mother's mouth, and hold it there until the steam reaches the cavity of the mother.
And then make her sneeze as we have said, and the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment remains ineffective and it has not been expelled, then you order the midwife to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or in marigold mixture, and then introduce it into the vagina and search for the afterbirth with it.  And when you have found it, take it and pull it out slowly.  But if it is attached to the wall of the mother's womb, then insert her hand as we have described, and when she has found the afterbirth, remove it little by little as directed so that the mother does not suffer from excessive pulling. Before that, it is necessary that it be moved from side to side with ease.
And if the mother's vagina is constricted, we have already described the treatment with sneezing and with herbal poultice application.
But if it is not expelled by all the methods we have described, then be careful not to exert further pulling.  However, it is necessary that what has come out of her vagina, lies on the woman's thigh, and then treat it with ointment and a four-ingredient medicine.  For that will cause it to decompose in a few days, dissolve, and be expelled.
However, when it decomposes, a bad odor rises from the head and stomach, and this afflicts the patient; and then fumigations and suitable remedies must be administered.
However, some of the ancients have already tested fumigations with dried narcissus and figs.
Form of instrument with which the woman is fumigated for the retention of menses and the afterbirth:
It should be made of glass or earthenware.
And the narrow end should be placed in the container, and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation should be placed over the flames of the fire.
And let whoever is in charge ensure that the fumigation is consumed and replace it with another.
Of the treatment of the unperforated anus of the child.
Many children are born with their anuses not perforated, which are already small and tight. Then the midwife should pierce that tightness with her finger; and if not, pierce it with a sharp instrument, and be careful not to touch the sphincter.
And then place some wool soaked in wine and oil over it; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear it is obstructed, then place a tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wants to digest.
And sometimes blockage of the anus occurs due to the consolidation of a plague or abscess; then it is necessary for that consolidation to be incised, and then treated with what we have said about the cure and the lead.
Of the cure of the fistulas that develop afterward.
The fistulas that form in the lower area, with pus, swollen and thick, which develop near the anus externally or within the space of one side.
And it is a fistula or multiple ones.
And when that swelling is longstanding and comes from watery white moisture or subtle putrefaction, and sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
And those that are penetrating are known by what comes out of them through discharge and windiness; and sometimes the patient experiences discharge, and strong worms come out of them.
And sometimes these fistulas extend into the bladder and into the opening of the penis; and some of these penetrating ones extend to the joint of the thigh and into the bone marrow of the thigh.
And how a penetrating fistula into the anus is recognized, compared to a non-penetrating one, is that you insert your index finger into the anus, and gently probe the fistula with a thin instrument of iron or bronze when there is no twisting/tortuosity.
But if there is twisting/tortuosity in it, then insert a thin probe of lead or horsehair until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
And if you don't feel anything at all, nor does any discharge, worm, or windiness come from the opening, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and then your efforts are towards a cure.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the opening of the penis, then the indication is to restrict urination there, and to apply medicine so that the area is healed.
But if it is penetrating into the joint of the thigh or into the bone, and causing pain in the surrounding area, then the sign of it is that the probe can penetrate here, if there is no twisting into the bone, and pain in the surrounding area; and that it will likely be permanent; and that no medication will work, nor is it healed with ointments.
And in all those penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure, and the cure of these is the work and vanity of foolish doctors, on which you should not rely.
But in the case of a non-penetrating and not chronic fistula, healing with iron is expected, as I have told you, and what I have already tested.
And it is necessary for the patient to lie on their back, raise their legs upwards, and bend the thighs towards their abdomen. Then, gently insert a lead probe, or an iron one if there's a twist in the fistula, until you know the exact location where the probe penetrates.
And if the patient feels pain around the anus, then it is necessary for you to insert your index finger into the anus.
And if you feel the probe already penetrating through your finger, or if you feel anything besides flesh or tissue between your finger and the opening, then you know for sure that it is penetrating; and therefore, do not work on it, for there is no healing in that, as we have said.
However, some might say that it heals in some men slowly.
And the treatment by which recovery is hoped for is to take a small, thin cautery, as described before, and introduce it into the fistula until it reaches near the anus. Then repeat this two or three times until you know that all the flesh around the fistula, which resembles a bird's feather quill, has been cauterized.
Then treat it with some bandages until all the cauterized flesh has healed, and then treat it with medicines that promote flesh growth and healing. If it is healed, then it is good; and if not, then it will not be healed at any time by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters, but does not penetrate to your finger which is in the anus, and between it and the probe there is a thick layer of flesh or tissue, and the fistula runs along the surface of the anus, then cauterize the anus from the beginning of the fistula. You should cauterize along with the probe, pushing it into the fistula until the cauterization reaches the point where the probe's tip lies, and by the probe it is released and removed.
Then cleanse those fistula-ridden tissues which are clustered together like a bird's quill, and leave no cause of them remaining.
But if a flow of blood occurs between you and your procedure while you cauterize those tissues, then the best and quickest instrument is to cauterize with fire or with a sharp medicine, for cauterization with fire has two good effects: it cauterizes those joined tissues, and it cuts off the blood, drawing out the moisture.
Then treat it with bandages or strips of cloth until the wound begins to heal, and then treat the sore with ointments that promote the growth of tough flesh and healing.
And those remedies which involve astringency and excision; when it is thus restored, it is healed and you need not fear a recurrence.
But if the fistula has reached the anus and is extending from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and investigate with it.
And thus, if you feel a barrier of sinew or flesh between you and it, and it is close to the penetration, then there is no surgery on it, but instead, treatment via trust and hope.
The treatment for this is done in one of three ways: either cauterize it as we have said; or cut it until you reach its cavity, so that it is possible for you to insert medications and facilitate healing; and do not use too much cutting, so as not to injure the surrounding tissues, and thereby cause the patient harm or death unintentionally; and then treat it as we have said, for a swift cure will be made; or lengthen that membrane and cleanse the pus which you have cut until near the anus, as we have said, either with a probe or another instrument with a sharp tip, and then cleanse those fistula-like tissues in the incision where you can, with cauterization; and then endeavor to repair the entire wound using incision, and if the opening above is not healed, and the fistula remains open in the anal region, the patient will be more vulnerable to further illness. And sometimes the fistula is treated in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is in the folds of the anus around the surface of the body with the string and along the margin of the anus, then use a probe with a pointed end, which is like a needle to prepare the tissues, in this manner:
and insert into that fold wrapped in five threads or around them; and then insert the probe with a thread into the fistula until you reach its cavity.
However, if it penetrates the margin of the anus near the inside, then you pull the thread from that hole as if you inserted your finger into the anus; and pull out the end of the thread and tie the two ends together, and tighten each one, and leave it for a day or two, and when you further cut the thread into the flesh, tighten it well until those tissues are cut between the two ends of the thread and fall away.
And then treat the wound until it is healed and sound.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever manner is prepared for you, but do not make it too deep, for it is not your task to do so, lest you injure the muscle; and then treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the pointed spatula with which the fistula is opened:  the curve of which is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that you do not cut what is not necessary, as often happens.
Of the suturing of hemorrhoids in which blood flows in the incision of those.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds, for either they are between the buttocks like lumps of charcoal, or they are like bunches of grapes. And of those there are small and large, and that blood runs from them constantly and is one, and are many, and are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are according to the times of little humidity, from which flows yellowish water or a little blood with a continuous substance, and it is according to the color of the substance.
And the cure for those that are inside the anus is that you command the patient to sit and squeeze until the anus opens and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you grasp and suspend them with forceps or with your nail, and then cut them near their roots.
But if the forceps are not holding them due to their moisture and softening, then take them with a rough cloth or cotton or wool fleece, and extract them with your fingers, and then cut them and sprinkle some hot powders onto their cuts, so that they are there in place of cauterization; or cauterize them as it is described in the cauterization chapter. And then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
And if the anus does not open, then prick the patient with a pricker that has a small bite, and wash it with whatever is in the anus, so that it opens slightly when the patient squeezes.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is slight, and it is that you grasp them with your nail, or grasp them with forceps, and cut them, and then treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And whoever you have cut, you should apply stitches to them in this manner: take a thread wrapped around it, thread that through a needle, then pull the hemorrhoids apart, and push the needle into the root of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the thread to the part below the needle, and do it latitudinally; and tighten the hemorrhoid with a tight stitch, and then tie the thread and take out the needle.
Do this to all of them, and leave one of them unsewn, so that the excess blood flows from it.
And then place a cloth soaked in warmed oil or ointment over the anus; and place it over the area, and tell the patient to rest. And then leave it until it falls out; and when it has fallen out, treat them with ointments or other remedies until they are healed.
And if they are old and no longer respond to that medicine, then you must scrape them with the point of a spatula or your fingernail until they are moist and the layer of pus and scabs on top, which prevents healing, is removed; and then treat them until they are healed.
Then you scrape them with a more forceful scraping than the first, until much blood comes and they are scraped clean; and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that a boil, or inflammation, is key, and it is a red, round swelling the color of the body, similar to a flower bud, and it appears throughout the body, especially in the parts below the feet and on the fingers, and it often causes pain in the region affected by the inflammation.
Then it is necessary to cut open what is in the area surrounding the boil, holding it with forceps or tweezers, and remove it from its root; and then treat that area.
And if you wish, cauterize it as described earlier in the chapter.
But a wart is a small, rough, fistulated, round elevation on the body's surface, and it often appears on the hands of children.
And the treatment for it is to scrape or cut it, or to press it with a file or a needle until it bursts. And if you wish, cauterize this, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine.
However, a pimple is a small, rough or fistulated, large elevation on the body's surface, often occurring on the penis. When the cold touches it, it is felt like an ant bite, and it spreads around the body.
And the treatment for this is to take a hollow tube, like a hawk's or vulture's feather, that is strong, and place it over the pimple until the tube encircles it.  Then, rotate your hand with the tube until you cut what is inside the pimple's boundary and press it against the surrounding flesh to remove the pimple from the root.
And if you wish, do this with a tube of bronze or iron according to this method:
The part above the tube should be thin, closed (meaning not perforated), wrapped so that the application of the tube and its rotation are facilitated.
And if you wish, cauterize the pimple as previously described in the cauterization of a boil in the chapter on cauterization.
Of the types of instruments used for giving treatment.
Sometimes treatment is done with silver or lead or cast or hammered bronze; and sometimes it's done with those small and large instruments, depending on the recipients.  That which is given to small children should be small; and that given to those with aching or sore bodies should have small treatments.
The form of large and small treatments:
The head of the cannula above it, where the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner; and there should be a clear demarcation where the bag is tied, like this.
And the lower end of it, which is inserted into the body, should be completely closed (that is, not open) very carefully, almost thin; and on one side of it there should be two openings, and on the other side one opening; and the size of the opening should be according to the thickness of the rays, and the largest one slightly smaller.
And the bag, in which the bladder medicines are placed, should be made of animal skin or sheepskin, and its size should be one palm.
And it should be pierced with many small holes, just as it is wrapped/rolled; and if the space between the holes is the thickness of a finger.
And then insert into those holes strong, pure (or strong, crude) oil, which should be ten or so oils; and attach the bag to that.  And when the bag is in place, tightly bind the head of the tube with a firm constriction between two marks, then tighten each hole with that [binding].  The important thing about using this binding is that you fill the bag with the medicine, making sure it is heated according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is not too hot nor too cold.
Then the patient should lie on their back, raise their legs, and place a cloth or sheet underneath them; then, anoint the end of the cautery iron with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage or similar; and then gently insert it into the anus.  Then the attendant takes the bag and squeezes it with both hands and firmly until all the material in the tube is expelled into the bowels; then remove the tube and the patient lowers their legs to the ground.
And if the medicine causes such an effect, hold it in place as long as possible; and if they sleep with it all night, it is better for healing.
However, if you use this method for ailments of loose bowels and expulsion of it (i.e., diarrhea), then you should repeat the cauterization until healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or festering sores in the anus, then the tube should be very thin and delicate, like the tubes used to cauterize children.
Of the treatment of plagues.
I have already stated in the division of plague treatment what was appropriate for the book, and I say thus the treatment of those with hand and with medicines according to the fulfillment (or, the completion/appropriateness).
Therefore, I say that plagues are diversified according to how the plagues are made and according to the place where the plagues occur.
And the causes why plagues are often made are like the throwing of a stone, or the incision of a sword or knife, or a blow with a spear, or a stick, or an arrow, or similar to those from many causes.
But the plagues that are on parts of the body are like a plague that falls upon the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the belly, or the liver, and similar to those of the members (or limbs).
And I am recounting the treatment of some plagues, so that you may apply that reasoning and rule to other plagues.
And I will begin with the simple plagues of the head, for the remembrance of the compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore, I say that when a simple plague occurs on the head, and it is not a fracture, then consider: if it is from the throwing of a stone or similar, and the skull has only been fractured, and it is a serious wound, and you fear the onset of a bad boil on the patient, then you should quickly bleed the cephalic vein, and do not delay this; and draw from him blood according to his strength, if no other reason forbids the bloodletting, especially if the blood that has come from the wound is little.
And let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the wounded part; and guard the patient from repletion and from strong food and drinks.
But if any reason prohibits bloodletting, then the diet should be lessened, and he should avoid meat and strong drink.
And apply to the wound, if a bad boil has occurred there, a poultice made from roasted oil or wine in which something astringent has been steeped.
But if you are sure of a bad boil, then apply to the wound, if it is recent, its own blood, and if the air hasn't changed the powder, which I will shortly recommend.
And if the air has already changed that, then apply some ointments until it is healed.
However, if the wound is large or from a deep cut or similar, and its edges are not closed with stitches, then close them with sutures, as I will recommend later on in the suturing section.
But if the wound has already exposed the bone and tendon, and there is no retention but a small suspension, then you should cut that, and then treat the wound with medicines, restoring the flesh soon in the place of the damaged area, and order the patient to eat foods rich in substance: heads, and shaped like the meat, until it is repaired.
And if you find putrefaction in the damaged area and it doesn't adhere to the bone, then you cut away all the rotten material and discard it, and then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood might flow, and it is not severed by medicine, then you search for the artery, and if you find it unsevered, then you cut it with a scalpel, or tie it; and if necessity requires that what we have said does not work, then you cauterize until the flow of blood is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is slight; therefore, you should sprinkle this powder on them, for it will consolidate them before the air alters them.
And the method for the powder is this: take one part olive oil, two parts dragon's blood, and three parts unquenched causs.  Grind it all finely and sift it, then fill the wound with it, and apply a good bandage so that it adheres well to the wound, and coagulates with the blood.
And then bandage it tightly with dressings and leave it, and do not remove it until it is suppurated, for the medicine will not be eradicated from there until it is healed.
And sometimes this works alone, when you do not have frankincense and dragon's blood at hand.
And this same operation is done on large wounds when it is appropriate to place it on them and bind them tightly, and in fresh wounds with their own blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, especially in summer, then this powder is not suitable for their application. Instead, treat them with what we have already described, or apply digestive ointments to them, or dusts of barley flour with water and honey until they dry; and then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
But if the wound is accompanied by a fractured bone, and it is small, then you extract it with skill.
And I will describe the treatment of skull fractures in what follows.
Of wounds of the neck.
However, if the wound occurs on the neck, there is no difference in treatment compared to a simple wound of the head.
However, if the wound affects the neck's nerve or artery, if it's a nerve, no healing is possible unless the treatment avoids strong astringents, like alum and vitriol and similar things, as they damage the nerves and counteract it. And do not apply anything cold to the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest of all the members.
And if it is treated with gentle medicines, such as washing with fresh water, sometimes infused in oiled or un-oiled, and poultices when washed with fresh water and other minor stones following this method, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then apply stitches, or close its edges, and then treat it with powders until it heals.
But if the wound is deep or reaches the lower bone marrow, then pierce it at the lowest point.
But if the wound has already cut an artery and blood is flowing, then separate or cut that artery, or tie it off, or cauterize it if necessity compels you to do so.
But if the vertebrae of the neck or all of them have been cut, and the veins of the neck are preserved, then you should bring the edges of the wound together with sutures along the spine of the neck and do not touch that area.  First align it, and return it to its natural position, then secure it with appropriate bandages, and leave it for a few days; then treat it with ointments containing astringents and stimulants until it is healed.
But if the wound has already been made in the bone, then you should clean it.  If there are bone fragments there, remove all you can; and those you can't remove, leave them until the wound becomes clean and the discharge from the wound is relieved.
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle the powder recommended to you over it. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with what the recollection will provide in its appropriate chapter.
If the wound is from a lance or knife, and you assess the depth of it, then consider if the wound is producing air when the patient breathes; then know that the wound is likely fatal.
And if there is no great depth, and the wound is recent with its own blood, then you put on the powder in the first hour, and do not press it so that the blood is not retained in the depth of the wound and returns to the heart and kills the patient, but apply an attractive ointment, and renew it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not available, then you place a piece of old cloth over the wound opening to absorb the humours; and have the patient sleep on the wound, so that the collected fluids drain out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound, and the patient shows no spasms or tremors in the heart, nor constriction of the airways, and the other bodily conditions are good, then know that the wound is safe; and then treat it with herbs and other cures until it is healed.
But if healing is impossible, and the wound remains open indefinitely, then know that a fistula has formed; therefore, treat it according to the chapter dedicated to fistulas.
And if the wound is caused by a cut from a knife or sword, and it is superficial on the foot or leg, then treat it with sutures if it is large, or with powders if it is small.
But if the wound has already penetrated the bone, and if pieces of it are protruding, then you should clean the wound and try to remove those pieces if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound can heal, for removing them will be less painful.
And for other wounds occurring on other limbs, the method of treatment is the same as what we have described.
Of wounds of the abdomen.
The ailment that affects the abdomen is either severe, mild, or moderate.
A smaller rupture is more difficult to address in another way, and the restoration to its proper place is even more challenging if you delay the repositioning of the damaged parts promptly, for it opens and swells, making its reintroduction difficult.
Therefore, the best rupture is a moderate one, for in that case the repositioning of the intestines is not difficult, unlike the two types previously mentioned.
And understand that the suturing of the abdomen is done in four ways, but two of these methods are common and applicable to the suturing of other parts of the body as well.
And two other specific methods are applicable to other parts of the body, although they are particularly appropriate in suturing the abdomen.
And I will explain each one to you with explanation and clarification.
Therefore, I say that when the wound is small and some part of the intestine has protruded through it, and it is difficult to return it to its place, this can be due to either the smallness of the rupture as we have said, or when the intestine has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And therefore, when this is the case, you should warm the area by soaking a sponge or damp cloth in warm water alone, or in water with squinant, cyperus, and spikenard, and apply this to the protruding intestine until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes, doing this with a styptic substance is better than using only water in resolving the inflammation.
And when you see the inflammation is resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which marsh mallow and mallows have been boiled, for this alleviates the discomfort with little effort.
But if the discomfort is lessened by this treatment, then carefully cut the rupture slightly with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are incised.
And the initial treatment is better, when it is appropriate rather than a surgical incision, and there should not be an occupation to cut (the tissue) for unnecessary and harmful purposes.
Of the instrument, consider its shape:
One part of it is sharp, the other part blunt, and the end is slender, but not as slender as a spatula; rather, it should be slightly blunt.
And therefore, if the rupture is extensive and the intestine is out, then its return should be according to its natural form, into its proper place, if possible, for that is better.
However, if the rupture is wide and is in the lower part of the abdomen, then you must have the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then you must raise their head and feet higher than the lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then always keep your attention and consideration on this, so that the part where the rupture is located is higher than the other.
And thus you should apply this in large and in medium ruptures.
And in small ruptures, place what you have prepared, and have the assistant hold the rupture completely with their hand and adjust the edges, and then ascertain if there is any reason for another stitch or suture nearby.
And this is the common method of suture: take a needle, or several needles depending on the size of the rupture; then place one at the edge of the rupture from the ring finger, and thread the needle, or others, so that you do not place the thread on the two edges of the cord with two edges of the ligature under the cord's inner portions, until you have made it penetrate from that part; and you have now joined two edges of the cord and two edges of the ligature, making four knots.
And then tighten with double thread around the needle, and sometimes from both sides together, and then join the two edges and the rupture by proper joining; and then leave the thickness of a finger and place another needle in it, and then tie that with thread in the same way as you did with the first needle; and do not stop doing this if necessary with the needles until you have completed the entire closure of the rupture.
And let the needles be medium in thickness and fineness, for very thin needles easily pierce the flesh; and thick ones are difficult to insert into the cord, and therefore they should be medium in fineness and thickness.
And the needle should not be placed too close to both ends of the cord, so that the flesh is not pierced easily and the rupture opens up before its consolidation.
And do not extend the sutures so that the rupture is prevented from healing.
And then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not disturb the patient's sleep; and you will place on the suture, powders spread around on all sides, which will hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the rupture is already healed.
And this type of suture with needles is most convenient for small wounds, for in their suture, one or two needles, or thereabouts, are sufficient.
However, the second suture is common: and it is that you bind with a suture the four extremities, of the cord and the two extremities of the strap, at one time, with a needle that is adequately wrapped, both in fineness and thickness.
And then, when with the needle you have pierced these four extremities, withdraw the needle from the same point from which you began, so that the thread retracts from the most superior part to the wound, so that the suture is like a cloth suture with which cloths are tightened.
And place between each suture the thickness of the little finger.
And this suture satisfies the men (or: this suture is known/acceptable to men).
And with such a suture, I closed a wound that had befallen a man in his belly, which had been wounded with a knife, and the rupture of the wound was more than a palm, and the intestines had protruded about two palms from the middle part of the intestine and the rupture was in the middle of the member; and then I returned the part of the intestine that had been outside the wound after 24 hours.
And the wound was consolidated in the space of 15 days or thereabouts, and I cured him and he was healed; and after that he lived for many years, and is alive and well.
And the other physicians had judged that he would not be healed; and by a miracle it was, for I did not treat him with an ointment, for it was in a place where no ointment or any medicine could be found, but I placed old cloth over the wound twice a day and washed it assiduously with honey water until it was healed.
But I will tell you two kinds of sutures, proper according to the narration of Paraula.
And it is that you begin with a suture of the cord (or thread), and insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
And so, as the needle penetrates the cord (or thread) and the same wound along its length and width, you leave the tip of the thread where you inserted the needle; and push the needle from the inside to the outside at the other end of the wound.
And when you have made that penetration, then you make it penetrate again into the same wound from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the thread that is in this wound, and insert the needle from the inside to the outside at the other end of the wound.
And make penetration with that penetration of yours, with which you make that penetration into the thread at the end of the wound, which is on its side, until all of it penetrates.
And now, starting from this same side, sew it with the end of the thread on the other side, and pull out the needle from the thread it has pierced, and then return that to that thread and sew the end of the thread that is on the other side to this end of the wound; and pull out that from the thread which is on that side.
Do this once and again, and do this once more until you have sewn everything that is outside according to this example.
And the essence of this method of suture is that you sew with a skin stitch, the way you sew skin, so that you sew the thread once from the end of the thread, and then leave it once again until you have completed it.
However, the second type of proper suture, which is called "Gualia" — a term of his own and recounted by him— is that you sew it in a similar fashion to how some physicians sew it, in that they bring each part to its corresponding part, as nature dictates; and they apply the end of one to the end of the wound, and this is done as I have recounted to you.
You should insert the needle into the end of the wound close to the outside part, and make it penetrate the inside part at that point, leaving the two ends of the thread; and then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside at the two ends of the thread.
And then turn each one, and make each one penetrate from the inside to the outside at the two ends of the wound on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the common, superficial suture, and is the suture of which I previously spoke.
This is the method of Gualia.
And some might say, the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles.  This is so that you insert a thread into each of them, beginning with the needle from your side, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who know how to close the skin equally.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle part of the belly, then the suture there is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
But the judgment of the treatment of plague is the same as for other plagues.
Which means that when you catch the plague fresh, with its blood before the air alters it, and you return the intestine to its place and sew it up and make it whole, then apply the flesh-healing powder to it.
And if the air has already altered the plague, then apply some ointments that are at your disposal until they form a hard stone and the pus dries and it is consolidated and cleaned; and then treat it as you would treat other plagues until it is healed.
But if the necessary medicines aren't available, then immediately apply something like old cloth or tow, and change it twice a day, as you've been taught, until it is healed, for you don't need other treatments in many cases when plagues are simple.
But if you fear the plague might spread to major limbs, then you should soak lion's wool in high-quality oil, or in processed oil, and place it around the affected areas, between the armpits and under the arms.
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in their intestines, as often happens, then treat it with dark astringent wine, and especially if the corruption has reached the intestine and has made a penetrating exit into the cavity.
And know that a wound in the large intestine is easier to heal than one in the small intestines.
And it is difficult to heal, for the intestine called "jejunum" does not receive healing from a plague affecting it entirely; this is because of the great multitude of veins within it, the size of the area, the delicacy of its structure, and its proximity to the nature of nerves.
But if what proceeds from the plague is tissue, and you obtain some fresh tissue, reduce it according to the method you use for reducing the intestines as well.
But if it has progressed to that stage and has already turned green or black, then you should apply a bandage to the darkened area, in order to bring blood flow to the area; for in the tissue there are veins and arteries.
And then, cut what is remaining of the ligature, and hang the two ends of the bandage from below the wound, so that the pull on the wound, towards the joining of the tissue and the discharge of the affected part, is lessened.
A reminder of wounds when they occur in the intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the intestine, and it is small, it is possible in some cases for it to be repaired.  For I have seen one who was wounded in their belly by a lance thrust, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old and had become a fistula, and from it escaped gas and wind.
Then I considered the cure for him, though it was not focused on healing, but I attempted to improve it so that it might be healed and the area be consolidated.
And after I saw the area healed, I told the patient that an illness might still affect him from the accident in his abdomen; but nothing bad resulted from it, and he remained in good condition, eating and drinking, and later took a bath and engaged in his activities.
And some experienced persons have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine, and it is small, then it should be treated in this manner:  You should take nettles with large heads; then bring the two edges of the wound together and place one of those nettles, with its mouth open, over the edges of the wound.  Then, when it bites those edges and closes its mouth, cut off the head, because it will adhere and not dissolve.
Then place another nettle beside the first, and do not stop doing this with nettles, one beside another, according to the size of the entire wound.
And then you compress it and close the wound; and those heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is healed; and no harm comes to the patient.
And it is possible that the intestine be bound with a fine thread made from the intestine of an animal, attached to it, once it has been threaded onto a needle; you should take the end of this intestinal thread, and it should be very lean, and bind the end of it to the thread of the wound, wrapped; then, insert the thread through a needle and secure the wound with it, and return the thread to the wound's rupture.
And this method of suturing with nettles is only a way of hope and trust (or reliance).
However, if the wound is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the delicate intestines, for then it is not really a cure, but only a temporary fix, and it will not fully heal.
Of the treatment of ulcers and fistulas.
Know that any wound or abscess, when it ages and becomes chronic, and is ulcerated, and does not heal and discharges pus continuously and is not incised, then, in any limb, it is universally called a fistula, and we call it an ulcer.
And a fistula, in truth, is a hard, white, fibrous growth, with no pain and a cavity similar to the cavity of a bird's nest; and thus it is called a 'riddled ulcer', that is, a 'cavity'.
And in some people it is moist, discharging pus; and easily the moisture is removed in a short time. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and sometimes thin, and sometimes large, and sometimes small.
I have already shown all those causes, and the signs of those and their cure with medicines in the division.
And it is necessary that I make you aware of the treatment of fistula, which is done surgically with the hands.
And know that fistula occurs in all parts of the body; for there are fistulas that reach large veins and arteries, or nerves, or the spine, or the intestines, or the bladder, or to one of the ribs, or to one of the spinal vertebrae, or to any of the joints formed by composition, such as the hand and foot; and those are the ones that affect parts close to the main limb and similar ones.
Therefore, those fistulas of this type are among the illnesses with difficult healing, and do not receive a cure, and any attempt to treat them with that method is work and ignorance.
And if any fistula's depth does not reach the locations mentioned, and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to understand it, then take a probe or iron, and if the fistula runs in a straight line, you will find it with it.
But if the fistula is winding, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead, for lead, with the lightness of its body, is eased and directed towards the winding path.
And if the fistula has many horrible things, it is not possible for you to indicate them with a probe.
Then irrigate the openings with a solution, for the moisture with which you irrigate it will flow toward the other openings and run from them.
And then inquire carefully, by whatever means you can, to know if there are bones or nerves there, and if the cavity of the fistula is distant or near, or if it is a fistula with many openings and this is all covered by your strength, with your questioning, by which you question the patient, and the discovery of the pain from your pressure with your hand on the area, and similar to the indications and accidental causes of the abscess.
And when you have considered all those causes with true judgment, then proceed to the cure according to the knowledge: and it is that you then consider whether the fistula is a superficial fistula near or in a healthy area, distant from a joint, or a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places which I have told you.
Then you dry the fistula as previously described by my narration, and remove what is within that filtration and corrupted flesh, and that which is born from the opening of the flesh, or of pus and similar things, and cure it until it is healed.
However, if the fistula is of great depth, and is accordingly, then it must be incised at the base as far as possible, and then clear it of all corrupted flesh; and then administer some bandages with sharp medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula which you have opened.
And do this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the cavity of the fistula from the corruption.
And then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have described.
However, if the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of this, then you probe and cauterize it as described, if you do not find any vein or nerve or main limb obstructing it, as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed and there is any corruption or blackness on it, then you scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then heal it with something that makes flesh grow until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and still bleeds as it did before, then understand that you have not fully eradicated the corruption; and then you uncover it again carefully, thoroughly scrape and clean it with the best tools you have, and then restore it.
And so if it is healed, well and good; but if not, then understand that the corruption is in a deep, distant part of the body, which cannot be reached, and then your only option is to leave it be.
If the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to pull it out, then you pull it out with fine forceps suitable for this.
And if there are many bones, then carefully remove them all, and leave no trace of them with your tools.
But if any issue with the humors is causing trouble, and their incision poses no fear or error, then cut those ligaments or flesh, if present, and free the bones.
But if there is no preparation to remove the bones immediately, then place something over the wound that can protect the wound and leave it until it is surrounded by flesh and ligaments, and ensure the wound does not become consolidated and the incision you made during the operation is contained.
If you are concerned, apply cotton soaked in warmed oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian unguents, or in other green ointments, for when those ligaments soften, and the bones are separated from them, the removal and pulling out of those parts is eased.
But if it's a large bone, like a leg bone or thigh bone, or similar, and only the surface is corrupted, then scrape that surface with a tool just behind it until the blackness and corruption are removed, and then restore the wound.
However, if the corruption has affected a large portion of the bone, and has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to cut through that bone completely to the point where the corruption has reached, and then heal that until it is consolidated.
And I will relate to you what happened to a man in his thigh, so that you may use this as an example and help in your own operation.
There was a young man, approximately 30 years old, who experienced pain in his thigh.  The affliction spread from internal parts of the body to the thigh, causing a large abscess, and it wasn't due to an external cause.
And then the condition was prolonged due to the doctors' error, until the abscess opened, and many materials were discharged.  His healing was delayed until his leg became fistulous, and many openings were formed, all of which discharged pus and bodily fluids.
Then, a multitude of doctors treated him for about two years, and none of them had the proper knowledge of the art, until I was called in.
And I saw his leg, and the materials flowing from those openings, a great deal of them; and the man's body was already completely drained, and his color was yellowish.
And then I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone.
And then I examined all the openings, and found them reaching their ends in all parts of the leg.
Then I carefully incised one of those openings until I exposed a part of the bone, and found it corrupted, already earthy and decayed, and blackened; and a part of the leg was already corrupted, having penetrated to the marrow.
Then I closed what had been exposed of the discovered bone.
And I judged that it was not in the bone, but that corruption which I had scraped off and closed, and I had already removed it.
And then I applied restorative medicine to the wound for a long time, but it did not heal.
And then I again opened and exposed the bone, further than the first exposure, and found continuing corruption with the bone.
And I removed what appeared to me of that corruption, and then I was forced to perform its treatment and restoration, but it was not restored.
And then I exposed it again and did not cease to cut the bone little by little, specifically, forcing its restoration, but it was not restored until I cut around a palm's width of it, and removed the marrow along with it.  Then I restored that with medicines, and it was slightly healed and healthy.
And further operations and cutting of it are not necessary except for the weakness of it, and because of its low tolerance and fear of death, for it was happening to it at all times due to an excessive evacuation causing a bad fainting spell.
And thus healed entirely, and there is nothing in place of bone but hard flesh; and its arrangement within its body is now good, and its strength has returned; and it has been restored to its proper functions, and it did not cause him any difficulty in walking or harm in any way.
However, if the bone is prominent in a dislocated place, then you should cut it in this manner: you should take a ligature and tighten it on the extremity of that prominent bone, and order someone to pull it outward; and place a thicker wool ligature on the first ligature; and then tie this over the flesh beneath the bone, and pull its extremity so as to draw the flesh downward, and you expose the flesh over the area you want to cut, so the cut doesn't damage the flesh.
And place a piece of wood or board under the bone properly, for when you do this, the cut is not prohibited from cutting through the corrupted flesh.
And the incision should be made over the corrupted area little by little, for if the corruption is in the bone's cavity and does not appear on its surface to the touch, another incision must be made.
And if the bone is corrupted but not protruding, with one part continuous with the other, and the corruption is in the middle or part of it, then you expose all the flesh around; and then place wood underneath, and then cut that first part where the corruption is until the incision continues to the other part.
And make the incision following the location of the corruption, a little bit, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, cut that corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it is continuous with the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not in a rational place, but in a problematic one.
And if the corruption is in the palm of the hand or sole of the foot, it is very difficult; however, you must investigate the corruption in whatever manner appears to you, and cut that, and cleanse that according to every possible disposition, and with each expedient rectify it if it does not cause you to cut a vein or nerve.
And know that the incisions and saws used to cut these bones are very specific according to the position of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their subtlety, size, and smallness, and their hardness and rarity; therefore, you must prepare suitable instruments for each type of operation.
And know that this operation indicates to you the type of instrument you need; when great study, length, and knowledge of the methods of this art, and experience of illnesses, are yours, you will already know what instruments are suitable for each illness.
And I am now providing you, at the end of this chapter, a list of the instruments you will use, along with simple instructions, with which you will proceed to your procedure, which you will test on others. Form of saw:
Form of another saw:
Form of a larger saw:
Form of ray: Let the head of this ray be in the shape of a star-shaped keyhead, and its points be in the shape of the points of an alstéfegi.
And it is not fitting except that with that [the ray] the heads of the joints are rubbed when they are corrupted, or the mouth/opening is wide/large.
Form of a smaller razor:
Form of a broad/wide razor:
Form of a well-made saw:  An arch should be made of it, the sharpness of it should be of iron, and the part of it made of wood should be a properly made pointed blade. Form of it (or, Form of the saw):
Form of a razor with a concavity/curvature:
Form of a very sharp/delicate razor:
Form of another razor with a curved tip:
Form of a small razor resembling a tentacle:
Form of a smaller cutting implement/knife:
Form of another cutting implement; this one resembling a saw, and its tip is like a saw, and it is used in many places in the dissection of bones:
Form of a saw which is suitable for the dissection of that which is pierced by bones:
And its tip is triangular and sharply pointed.
And it is made of Indian iron, and likewise, all the tools we have described, razors, cutting instruments, and saws, should be:
Of the cutting edges and the sawing of bones.
The extremities [of the disease] can be caused either intrinsically or extrinsically, or if you have treated that corruption with remedies, and the treatment is not effective, or if the corruption extends to the limb which is not affected by any cause, then you must cut into that limb where the corruption has spread, so that the patient escapes death or great harm to the limb.
And the sign of that which afflicts [the patient] is that the limb becomes black as if fire has already burned it, or the blackness spreads until that hardness enters that limb, seizing it and affecting the whole body; and then make a cut into it.
And likewise, if the cause of the corruption is the impact of some poisonous things, such as a sea scorpion, or viper, or weasel, and similar creatures.
And if the corruption or the injury is in the extremity of the finger, then you cut the finger, and do not allow the corruption to spread into the hand.
And similarly, if it affects the hand, then you cut it at the base of the forearm, and do not allow the corruption to spread so that it reaches the forearm.
And if instead, it affects the arm, then you cut the arm up to the elbow joint.
And if the corruption passes beyond the elbow, then in that case is the death of the patient; and to administer another cause for its cure is a matter of little use.
And similarly, do with the foot. When corruption affects the toe of the foot, then you cut it up to one of the bones.
And if it takes hold of the sole of the foot, then you cut off the entire foot. But if it ascends to the knee, then you cut the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached the knee, then there is no remedy but to let him go, and to leave the patient to death.
And the way to cut or sever the limb is that you tighten the ligament in the part below where you want to cut, and tighten another ligament over the area; and let the attendant extend a ligament down, and let the attendant extend another ligament up; and you separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments with a wide spatula until all the flesh is exposed; and then let it be cut or severed.
And it is necessary that a cloth be placed on all sides so that it does not touch the area itself, and that the patient experiences a well-adjusted and cautious abscess.
But if you encounter a flow of blood when working, then cauterize the wounded area carefully, or place some blood-stopping powders on it; and then return to your treatment until it is completed.
And then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
And I tell you what happened to a man on his foot, the same accident that I and you have described, which is that blackening occurred on his foot, with a burn similar to a fire's combustion.
And that corruption first appeared on his toe, until it spread to the entire foot.
And then that man prepared himself, since he saw the treatment affecting the limb with the severity of the pain and burn he experienced, and he incised that foot down to the joint, and the wound healed.
For a long time, that same corruption occurred on the index finger of his hand.
And then he came to me, and I was forced to address that excess using remedies I applied to his hand, effectively cleansing his body; but the excess wasn't dispelled, and it began to spread to the other fingers until it affected the whole hand.
And he urged me to cut into his hand, but I didn't want to do that, hoping for the expulsion of that excess, and fearing the death of the patient if I incised his hand, for the patient's strength was at its lowest ebb.
And after he left me, he returned to his homeland, and later word reached me that the man prepared himself and cut his entire hand, and it healed.
And I have related this story only to provide help in understanding this disease, and as a way to indicate the signs that accompany it and how it should be treated.
Of the treatment of sinuses and the quality of enemas with medicine.
When an abscess occurs on any fleshy part of the body, and the space of the abscess becomes large enough to collect pus, and it is then broken and perforated, and pus is discharged, leaving a hollow space like a vessel, and the skin over it is thin like a delicate cloth, and it hasn't progressed to deeper corruption, and it hasn't affected the bone, nerves or ligaments, it is called a sinus, and it is not called a fistula.
However, if the space becomes so large that the corruption spreads to other parts of the body, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.
And the treatment of it is to cut away the entire skin, like it has been turned inside out, especially if it is thin and like cloth, and make sure it does not adhere to the affected area due to its corruption.
But if you suspect the skin is adhering and that the corruption hasn't progressed deeper, and there's a visible opening in the skin, then treat it with an enema.
And if you consider it to be a sinus, and if it's large, and the discharge has a foul odor, then administer an enema with an Egyptian medicine, which is made of olive oil, sour wine, and vinegar in equal parts.  These are mixed in a vessel, and heated over a fire until the medicine becomes reddish and takes on the consistency of honey.
Then take what is necessary of it and dissolve it with water and honey; and use this mixture to administer an enema into the sinus, and constrict the opening, and leave the medicine there for two hours.
Then remove it with a spatula; and do this for as many days as necessary until the sinus is cleansed and the bad odor has gone away.
And sometimes, if this medicine isn't available to you, it's enemated with water from ashes; and you should take the ashes of willow, place them in water, then filter it and use that water for an enema until you are confident that the sinus is closed.
And if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, then administer an enema with water and honey, mixed with finely ground vinegar.  Or, use a mixture of wine and honey, because honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and wine helps to adhere the sinus, especially when the wine contains an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and are sure the sinus is healed, then give an enema with something that will help grow flesh in that area.
And you should take diafine ointment and dissolve it in rose oil and astringent wine; or you should administer an enema with other medicines and ointments that have the properties that I have already written in the treatise on ointments.
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow, so that the enema tube cannot be inserted, then widen it little by little with a small iron implement, and apply heated cloth wrapped in Egyptian or basil ointment until it widens.
And similarly, if the opening is wide, then you should bring the edges together with stitches, leaving enough space for the enema tube to fit without difficulty.
And if the opening from which the pus flows is elevated to the upper parts, then dry it in the lowest part of it so that the pus flows downwards, because when the pus is contained within the depth of the sinus, flesh will be generated there.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus down to the lowest bone as desired, then you must prepare the limb with a preparation through which the pus flows easily, as you are equipped, and that there is no cause for the pus to be retained there.
But the one over the sinus opening, which remains at all times to allow the matter contained within the pus to escape. And so that you may know if the pus flowing from the limb is much or little, or digested or undigested.
And by this you consider the location of the sinus, if the patient feels pain there or not, and if it is an abscess.
And as your treatment proceeds in this manner, and you see that the matter discharged over the sinus opening has adhered, or shows signs of adhesion, then on the second or third day, you loosen the scab, and when you loosen the scab, change the cloth and renew the ointment.
But if from the sinus a subtle virus is spreading, then do not despair of the adhesion, for the healing is taking its course; for some people, flesh regeneration is slow on their wounds, and for others the opposite is true.
And if undigested pus has been discharged from the sinus for many days, then know that the sinus has not adhered; and if the sinus adhesion is delayed and the cause prolonged, then you should adjust the drying effect of the medicines, and if the medicines are moist in their substance and virtue, they should be dried, just like a diachronic ointment, when excess moisture has been removed.
The final remedy, with which it is cured, is to take diachronic ointment, dissolve it in warmed oil, and add some old, strong wine to its substance.  Then mix these together and use the mixture.
And a similar procedure is followed when there is no pus: use diachronic ointment, honey when it has thickened, and apply it; or take myrrh, aloe, and incense, grind and powder them, and sprinkle over the honey while it is over the fire. Then spread this mixture on a cloth and apply it to the sinus. Or, use honey that has thickened, powder it, spread it on a cloth, and apply it to the sinus.
Sometimes, long-stemmed aristolochia and the roots of the celestial lily (and it is celestial lily), along with the flour of erran and centaury, are administered. Use these individually or combined, grinding and sifting them, and sprinkling the powder over the honey, as previously described, and use this mixture.
And if the sinus is prolonged and not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in the bone underneath, or in other hard parts of the body or ligaments.  Then cure it by fistular treatment, as previously described.
Concerning the treatment of whitlow (or felon), bruised nails, incisions in the finger, and further sections (or divisions).
Whitlow is an abscess that arises beneath the nail of a finger or toe, though it commonly appears on other fingers.  If prolonged and its cure is slow, it might be an abscess of a severe abscess, or become corrupted, and discharge pus, gradually corrupting the nail bed, often completely destroying the nail, and spreading its corruption to the bone until it emits a foul odor. The fingertip may become dark, and its color discolored.
And therefore, when you have performed the procedures we have described, and your treatment does not prove effective, you should cut away all remaining excess from beneath the nail with a knife, and then cauterize the wound, for a cautery is very helpful in this.
However, if the bone and nail are healthy, and the nail bed cavities are already pressing against the surrounding flesh, and causing it to swell and ulcerate, then you must place a thin wedge under the corner of the nail that is pressing on the flesh.  Push up the affected flesh and cut away the flesh with ease, and apply to the remaining flesh, medicaments that burn and corrode until all of it is removed. Afterwards, treat the area with ointments until healed.
But if the corruption has already reached the bone, then you must cut into and remove the bone, for a bone affected by corruption is never properly healed.
And if the corruption and decay extend into the finger, then you should cut it open at one of the joints, according to the anticipated recovery, and then treat it until healed.
However, if the nail suffers blows or friction, and intense pain results, then you must first bleed the patient, and then carefully scrape the nail with a sharp instrument, using a transverse cut from top to bottom. Be careful not to cut into the flesh beneath the nail, as you will cause the patient severe pain and create conditions for the formation of excessive, inflamed tissue in the area. Then, treat the affected area with whatever relieves the pain.
But a swollen finger, which is often found on the hands of some men, is easily affected, both in the flesh, and in the bones, or even in the nail.
And some of these swellings are born at the joint, or their origin is in certain finger joints. However, those that originate in the joints of the finger are not as bad, and those that arise in the joints are easily aggravated.
And for those that are fleshy growths, the incision is gentle, and you should cut it away from its base with a broad blade.
But for those that originate at the base of the joint, the cure is difficult; therefore, avoid cutting it.
But for those that arise on the fingers near the joints, you must first cut the flesh around it with a circular incision down to the bone, then use a suitable saw to sever it, and then treat it until healed.
But if the fingers are bound together abnormally, either by birth, or by the effects of an injury, plague, or burning, or similar causes, then the abnormal joining must be separated until the fingers return to their natural form.
And then place between them cloths soaked in heated oil to prevent them from quickly fusing, and separate them, or place a thin lead sheet between them until they are properly healed.
And similarly, if fingers are abnormally joined to the palm, you must sever that abnormal joining in a way that is suited to the member's shape.
Regarding incisions of veins, these are varicose veins.
Veins are varicose veins, and they are thick, twisted veins filled with melancholic superfluities which appear in many parts of the body, and more commonly in the legs, especially those of travelers, laborers, and those who carry heavy loads.
Therefore, you should administer a purging of the body of black bile several times with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
However, the treatment of these [varicose veins] with iron is according to two methods: one is that the vein be incised and the black blood be drawn out, and the other method is that the vein be raised and entirely extracted.
The incision is performed as follows: first, soak the leg in very hot water until the thick, muddy blood from the leg is resolved.  Then, tightly bind the patient's leg from the highest part of the thigh down to the area just below the knee with a bandage.  Then, incise the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision.  Then, raise the black blood from the bottom of the leg upwards and downwards, until the desired quantity of blood has been drawn, which will lessen the patient's ailment.
And then bandage it, and command the patient to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
And repeat the treatment by phlebotomy when the veins are filled up, and this is noted by the patient.
But the raising of them [the veins] is done in this way: you, who are attending to the patient's leg, if it is covered in hair, first place it in a bath and soak the leg in hot water until it reddens and the veins become prominent; or, if a bath is not available, use vigorous exercise until the limb is heated up.
Then dry the skin over the vein by making an incision along the vein, either behind the knee, or further down near the ankle.
And then open the skin with lancets and scrape the vein from all sides until it appears, and it is to be observed that the redness will become a black or dark colour.
And then, as it emerges, you see that white string (or cord) from the skin.
And then you place a reed under it [the vein] until it is raised and pulled out of the skin, and suspend it with a lancet or similar sharp instrument.
And then make another incision near the first incision, after three days, and scrape the skin over the vein until it appears.
And then raise it [the vein] and cut it in the second incision, towards the heel, and then pull it out and elevate it until it comes out through the second incision, and then pull it out from the incision above.
Do this until you pull it [the vein] out of the incision that is highest or most superior of all the incisions, until it is all out; and then cut it.
And if you are unable to pull and elevate it, then insert a needle with a strong double hook and tie it and pull it out, or insert a reed under it and turn your hand around in all directions until it is thrown out. And be careful not to cut it; for if it is broken, it will be difficult for you to elevate it much, and it will have caused harm to the patient.
And when you have completely removed it, then place on the affected area wool soaked in wine and rubbed oil and unrubbed oil, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, having twists to which it is wrapped in parts, and it is not straight as we have said, then you must cut on that part of the twist of it and in the places where it is wrapped, and then suspend it with hooks until you lift it all out.
And be careful in your incision not to cut the vein and not to injure it, for it will be difficult for you to lift it; and use your prudence in this.
Form of the incision by which the vein is cut:
It is not sharp like hooks or with a pointed end so that it does not injure the vein; and it is of great flexibility, like a lion's, for if it were slender, it would cut the vein through its thinness; it does have superfluous thickness, as we said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in warm lands, like in the land of the Arabs, and in the hot and arid lands of India where little vegetation grows.
And it is easily generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction that comes from beneath the skin, like snakes, worms, and insects that breed between the skin and the flesh.
And a sign of the onset of this condition is a fierce inflammation in the leg where the vein is; and then the area becomes blistered; and then the vein begins to emerge from the place of the blister, appearing like a plant's root.
And when its extremity appears, then you should wrap a lead weight, equivalent to one drachma to two drachmas, around it, and bandage that and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
And as many times as you find any cause of it on the outer parts, wrap that in lead and bandage it. And if the condition is prolonged, then you should cut off a part of it and bandage the remaining part; and do not cut it off at the root until it is completely out, because if you cut it off at the root, it will contract and enter the flesh, causing an abscess, swelling, and a bad ulceration in the area.
Therefore, it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is expelled from behind it and no cause of it remains in the body.
And from this vein, some men have had it extend to five palms and ten fingers, and it has come to my attention that one has extended twenty palms.
And if it is incised during its treatment, then insert a rod into the cavity and pierce it with a long opening, through the body, until everything that is within the material is evacuated, and allow the area to fester for several days with medicines; and then cure it by the treatment of abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, and especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or on the foot, and it has many openings, and a branch comes out from each opening.
Therefore, cure it thus as we have said in the division and with what has been said above.
Of the incision regarding worms generated beneath the skin, and it is called the bovine disease.
This illness is called in some lands near us the bovine disease because it often affects cattle, and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh, and it travels throughout the body going up and down, and it is felt moving from limb to limb until it breaks through the skin and comes out.
And its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors, just as worms, serpents, and earthworms, and ascarids are produced in the belly.
And it is feared for its malice, for when it travels through the body and rises to the head, and reaches the eye, it often causes a severe inflammation there, entering and destroying the eye.
And therefore, when you wish to cure it and extract it, it is done only by following its movement and appearance as felt, and then you must tightly bind and constrict what is above it and what is below it, and then carefully dry the area and extract it.
And if it is hidden in the flesh and you cannot find it, then apply a cautery with fire to the area until it dies, and the greatest fear is that it will corrupt the area, as we have said.
And if you see that creature reaching the head near the eye, then apply strong pressure to the forehead, dry the area carefully, and extract it.  The patient must use medicines to cleanse the body of the bad, putrid humours, and avoid foods that cause putrefaction.
Of the incision upon the illness.
This illness is called nafir in our land, and it is a pain which comes upon certain limbs, and then it moves from one limb to another.
And I have already seen that, as I have told you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I examined her arm and saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm. After an hour, I saw this swelling move like a worm climbing upward, but more swiftly than a worm could, like living silver running from place to place.
And then the pain went to that place and settled in the muscle, and then stayed there for an hour.
And then it moved to the other body part until it reached the other arm.
And then it returned to me, moving around her entire body as I watched; and I was very surprised by its movement from one limb to another. And I had previously seen this sort of thing with my own eyes, though I have seen many instances where pain is moved from limb to limb. But I did not see it with my eyes quite like this in the woman.
And I did not consider it anything else, but that it was because the woman was old, with dried-up body and exposed veins, and in this appearance, that wind-like sensation was exchanged.
And it is necessary that this sort of  "return-healing" not appear in those who are delicate and with moist bodies and hidden veins.
And when you desire the cure for them, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to your eyes as we have said, therefore you press gently and lightly upon it until that constrained wind-like sensation is gone, and cauterize the location.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then you cure it with an extraction of the body's humours and with things that expel windiness, and alleviate them with stinking pills and pills of serapi and similar remedies.
Of extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diverse according to their types and according to the parts of the body in which they lodge, for their diversity is that some have large points, and small, and concave, and blunt, that is, solid; and some have three angles, and some with tongues; and some with barbs.
And the signs of the brain when an arrow lodges in it, and pierces the bone, and exits through the skull which is over the brain, are a sudden violent headache, and dizziness, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of thought and vomiting of bile, and often the ability to speak is lost and the voice is destroyed, and white moisture resembling dust comes out from the area of the wound, and the area looks like the flesh is becoming watery.
Therefore, if these signs appear to you, then you abstain from treatment and extraction of the arrow, unless it is on the outside.
But the signs of an arrow lodging in the heart, especially if it is near the left breast, are that it feels as if it were lodged in something hard, and not empty; and the movement of the arrow is often similar to the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and the body chills, the extremities become cold, and the person faints; and therefore, know that death is imminent without a doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has struck the lung are the spitting of frothy blood from the wound, and the vessels near the neck are inflamed, and the patient's complexion has changed, and they breathe deeply, and crave the intake of cool air.
And if the arrow strikes the membrane that is in the foot, the pain is then near the small ribs, and there is great difficulty with vehement pain and sighing, and all the muscles of the limbs are affected.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then frequently undigested food will come forth from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly, and is embedded there, there will be an opening in the wound, or the lining, or the intestines, which are ruptured, and there is no hope for treatment, if the arrow is not removed.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine is discharged externally, and some cause emanates from the wound to the outside, and severe pain is upon the patient, then know that it is fatal.
However, the other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulders, and arms, and the vertebrae of the back, and the collarbone, hip, leg, and similar limbs, are saved according to the greatest arrangements, when the arrow does not strike a vein or artery and it is not a poisoned arrow.
And I tell you this, what I have seen of these arrows, so that you may signify this upon your treatment.
Which cause is this: that in a man, an arrow struck the tear duct of his eye at the root of his nose, and I removed it from the other side, under the ear, and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the fold of his eye, beneath the lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and only a small end was retrieved, connected to its shaft, and it was a large, pointed arrow of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with a lion-like iron head, which had no feathers.
And the Jew was healed, and no bad accident happened to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man, which had lodged in his throat; it was an Arabic arrow, and it was one with feathers; and then I incised the area around it, and it was already embedded in his throat; and then I skillfully dealt with it, and then extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man, which had lodged in his abdomen, and I thought he would die from it; and then, after thirty days had passed and no change had occurred in his condition, I incised the arrow and worked on it, and he was healed, and no bad accident happened to him.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow lodged in his back, and the wound healed over it, but after roughly seven years, the arrow came out near the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow lodged in her abdomen, and the wound healed within her, and there was no change in her condition, and the woman suffered no harm in any of her natural bodily functions.
And I saw another man in whose face an arrow lodged; the wound healed, and the arrow remained embedded, causing little pain, and many similar cases like this.
And I extracted the arrow from the King's nobleman that had lodged in the middle of his nose, and had already deviated slightly to the right side, and the entire arrow was concealed.
And I was called to treat him shortly after the arrow struck, within three days.
And then I found the arrow wound very tight; then I probed it with a fine probe, and I felt nothing; but he felt a prick beneath his right ear, and I inferred that this prick was caused by the arrow's point.
And I applied a plaster to the area, one with attractive and digestive virtues, trusting that the area would fester, so that the arrow wound would appear, so that it would dry over it.
And no significant injury occurred to the area where the arrow had struck; and I continued with the plaster on it for many days, and no further injury occurred; and the wound consolidated meanwhile, and the patient remained in pain from the extraction for many days, until one day he felt the arrow within his nose and told me about it.
Then I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it opened up, and with the probe I examined it, and found the fine point of the arrow, which adhered to the shaft.
And then I adjusted the application of the sharp medicine to the wound until the arrowhead became clearly visible to me, and I spent time with this for a period of up to four months.
And then, because the wound had become enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert the forceps into it, and remove it, and it did not yield, then I did not cease to refine and devise strategies on it, until one day I began with mechanical devices to remove it with carefully crafted forceps, in the manner described later in the chapter, until I extracted it; and then I healed the wound.
Some physicians thought that the cartilage of the nose would not be restored, but I restored it and the wound was healed, and the patient recovered completely, and suffered no further harm.
I recount to you the method of extracting certain arrows, so that you may consider this a rule and signification of what I have not said, because the parts of this art and the definitions of it are not grasped by narrative, nor do they fit the book.
Skilled craftsmen compare little with much; and that which is present with that which is absent; and find new operations and new instruments in the removal of foreign bodies from the art when they occur.
Therefore, I say that arrows are not expelled from the limbs in which they are lodged except in two ways: either by drawing them out from the place in which they entered; or by applying force to the opposite part.
That which is expelled from the place where it entered, or is an arrow lodged in fleshy tissue, is pulled and expelled.
If you do not follow the method at the time of the wound, then it is necessary to leave it for a few days until the surrounding flesh may heal, and the extraction of the arrow and its expulsion is made easier.
And similarly, if it is lodged in bone and you do not follow the method, then leave it for a few days and repeatedly apply pulling and movement each day, and it will be expelled.
And if you do not follow the method for a few days, then you must pierce around the arrow in that bone from all sides with a fine drill until the arrow's lodging is enlarged, and then extract it.
But if the arrow is already hidden in a place within the body, and is hidden from sight, then you probe it with a probe, and if you feel it, then pull it out with instruments suitable for extraction.
And if you cannot do so because of the tightness of the wound and the length of the shaft, and there is neither bone, nerve, nor vein involved, then you should work on the wound until it is widened and the arrow can be extracted.
And if there are ears with which it is held, then you carefully free the flesh in which it is lodged from every side using all possible methods; and work on this, if you cannot free the flesh by fracturing or twisting the ears until it gives way.
And when you administer the extraction of the arrow in whichever location it might be, use twisting motions with your hand and forceps on all sides until you get it to yield; and proceed with utmost subtlety to ensure the arrow does not break, and that the extraction is not overly difficult.
And if you cannot do it at that time, then leave it for a few days until the surrounding parts have healed, and then repeat the procedure when it has been relieved. But if there is an adverse flow of blood, then you administer the treatment described in its chapter.
And use your skill in incising a vein, nerve, or tendon, and use every possible method for the removal of the arrow; do this with ease, calmness, slowness, and firmness as I and your have described.
And thus, remove the arrow in such a way that the patient is in the position corresponding to the direction in which the arrowhead was embedded in him, for this is more helpful. But if that is not possible for you, then administer whatever is possible for you, according to the figures.
However, if the arrows are protruding from the opposite side, or if you already removed a part to the outside, or if the arrowhead has a bend or curvature at the point of the shaft's nearest portion and sometimes above that, then you should cut there; and the cut should be according to the amount the forceps are holding; and then pull that out, for it is thus easily removed.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then you twist the blade in the opposite direction until the arrowhead sinks further into the bone, and expands itself, and then remove it.
And if not, leave it for a few days, and then repeat the procedure until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow is in there, then you push it out with it.
However, if the shaft is lodged and you want to administer a push, then you insert it, if it is blunt, with a hollow instrument so that the concavity of it enters the shaft of the arrow, and then push it out with it.
But if the arrow is hollow, then you push it out with a strong instrument inserted into it, for the arrow is lightened by that.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you cauterize all the flesh in which the venom is, if it is possible for you to do so, and then treat it with whatever is appropriate.
And if the arrow lodges in the foot, or in the abdomen, or in the bladder, or in the side, and is close enough that you can touch it with the probe, and it is possible for you to cut around it, then cut around it and be careful not to cut a vein or a nerve, and extract it, and then cauterize the wound if necessary, and treat it until it is healed.
Form of forceps with which the arrows are pulled out:
Let their tips be like the beak of a bird, shaped like a saw when they grasp the arrow so as not to let go of it.
And of those, many types are made, large, small, and medium, according to the size of the arrow and its smallness, and the size of the wound, and the constriction of it.
like a ray so that the insertion of it into the concave arrow is eased and it is pushed with that.
Of phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins for phlebotomy, of which the practice of phlebotomy is customary to do so XXX, of which are in chapter XVI, are two pulsating veins near the ears, called *alhasisain*; two veins in the two apparent temples; and two veins in the two tear ducts, called *aspicientz*; and the vein situated in the middle of the forehead; and the vein at the tip of the nose; and two veins at the neck; and two veins on the upper lip; and two veins on the lower lip; and  — these are the veins called *algelic* —; and two veins below the tongue. But the veins that are phlebotomized in the arms are five; for of those, one is the cephalic vein, and it is beside the wild side; and the people call it "the vein of the head"; and it is smooth, and is a middle vein, and is composed of a branch of the basilica, and another branch of the cephalic; and the people call that "the vein of the whole body"; and the basilica is the vein that is located on the domestic side, and it is called "citillar", and the common people call that "the vein of the belly"; and the vein of the arm, and it is located above the fossa, and it is the one in which phlebotomy is performed, and it is the one that appears above the elbow by manifest appearance; and *salvatella*, and it is the vein that is between the aforementioned auricular and the smallest finger, and there are two branches there.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins; one of them is located below the curve of the knee on the wild side; and the second is the *sophena*, and its place is below the leg on the domestic side; and the sciatic vein, and its place is below the leg on the wild side; and in the leg are other veins similar to those.
The benefit of the veins near the ears is for headaches, migraines, toothaches, and old sores of the head.
And the method of bleeding those veins, as I recommend to you, is that you should place the patient's head on a raised surface, and rub the patient's head at the occipital region, in the location of both veins with a wide cloth with good friction; then gently restrain the patient's neck with a bandage until both veins appear, and the places of their presence are near the ears in two depressions on the head; and locate them with your finger; and if you feel the pulse of those veins with your finger, then you should proceed with the lancing.
Then take the lancet, which is the one that is sharp, and then insert it under the vein at the right angle until the phlebotomy reaches the bone. And then elevate your hand with the vein and the angle upward and cut the vein with a sharp incision. And the length of the incision should be about the width of two fingers; and let the blood flow out as much as you want.
And then compress with cloths and leave it until it is healed.
And already, at the beginning of the book, the incision of those and their cauterization have been described.
But of the two arterial veins that are in the temples, the benefit of phlebotomy is for ancient migraines and frequent, vicious eye inflammations and the flow of acute excess humors discharged in the eyes.
And the method of phlebotomizing those is as I recommend to you:  hold the patient's head by the hair until the two veins are visibly apparent, and the pulse of them is palpable under your finger; then you should apply a ligature.
Then raise the skin over the vein with your index finger, and insert the lancet underneath, lifting the vein up; and cut it as you did with the other two veins; and allow the blood to flow according to the amount you need.
Then loosen the patient's collar, place your finger on the vein for an hour, then put a compress and powders on it, and tightly bind it, and leave it until it is healed.
And already the remembering of them, and the incision, and the attraction [of the blood] are described at the beginning of the book.
Therefore, the benefit of phlebotomy of the vein on the forehead is for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein in relation to old diseases of the face, and migraines, and stiffness, and foul ulcers.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is as I recommend to you; this is that the patient should hold their head with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument called a "fossori" (or "digger"), which is shaped like this:
Place the sharp point at the end of the fossori on that vein and strike it with a hammer or other similar implement, and allow the blood to flow according to the desired amount; then loosen the patient's hold and bind it until healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a lateral phlebotomy, however, the phlebotomy should not be with a pointed end like the other phlebotomies, but rather with a broad end, and phlebotomize it across, because the bone is close and strong, and it would easily break the phlebotomy if it were narrow.
But the benefit of the two veins located near the tear ducts is for scabies of the eyelids, for stiffness and swelling in the eyes, and for diseases of the face.
And the procedure for phlebotomy is that the patient should hold their head with a bandage, and then the phlebotomist should perform the procedure, while you stand over the patient's head.
And the phlebotomy should be made across, a little lengthwise, with a narrow lancet, because there is no flesh in the area; and if the lancet is narrow, the tip will very easily break.
Then allow the blood to flow as much as is necessary, and apply a compress, and hold it in place for a night, then remove it.
But phlebotomy of the nasal vein is beneficial for acute fevers and severe headaches, and for facial illnesses, migraines, and swelling that occurs on the face, especially if it is chronic.
And the procedure for nasal phlebotomy is that the patient should hold their head, and you should hold their nose with your left hand, and take a narrow, long lancet and place it in the middle of the nose, in line with it, because the vein is not apparent there, and the blood will start flowing soon after.
You should slowly move your hand with the small lancet and let the blood flow according to your needs; and then bandage it for a night, because it will heal easily.
However, performing phlebotomy on both sides of the body may be helpful for constricted breath, the beginning stages of leprosy, many illnesses, impetigo, and nasty, corrosive ulcers, as well as herpes.
And the procedure for phlebotomy on both sides is that the patient should hold their head down with a bandage on each side; the medical practitioner should be positioned above the patient's head, and the patient should be seated on a bench.
Then, carefully cut the vein lengthwise with a wide lancet, little by little; and then extract blood in a moderate amount, or according to whatever the need may be; and then do the same on the other vein.
Then loosen the bandage and gently constrict both veins with a moderate pressure so that the patient is not suffocated, and leave it until morning because the wound will be healed.
And the benefit of phlebotomy on the facial veins is for small boils and pustules on the mouth and gum rot and nasty ulcers and fissures, and for bad ulcers that are on the nose and surrounding areas.
The procedure for phlebotomy on those veins is to have the patient sit before you, and tie their neck with a bandage.  Then, you should lift their lips and look for two veins, one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left; the location of each is indicated by the darkness of each of them, and more importantly, because small dark veins are present around them.  Then, cut each with a precise incision.
But if you are uncertain, and don't know which one is which, then you should make the incision on the largest and most apparent of those veins.
And do the same for the two veins on the upper lips.
However, for the two veins beneath the tongue, phlebotomy is useful for conditions affecting the head, throat,  ulceration of the uvula, and ailments of the mouth.
And the method of phlebotomizing those veins is to have the patient lie between your hands, facing the sun, and raise their tongue.  Look under the tongue, on one side of the tongue, a vein and on the other side a vein, and the color of each is tending towards blackness.
And then phlebotomize each vein; and be careful not to injure your hand while phlebotomizing those, because beneath those are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are those that are commonly found in all men, and their phlebotomy is done in two ways: either by using a leech or olive [applying the leech/olive to the vein] with a gradual decline in size; or by cutting with a lancet, and it is called ‘alnessil.’  And this is its method:
Place the leech like this, and it is appropriate to open concave veins full of visible, large, and those that contain thick, troubled blood.
And this phlebotomy is of smaller width and a more subtle extremity, and is appropriate for phlebotomy of thin veins containing thin, citrus-like blood.
However, the benefit of phlebotomy of the basilic vein, which is one of three veins:  it draws blood from illnesses under the collarbone and neck, and from conditions affecting the feet and abdomen.
And it is appropriate for the phlebotomist, when performing phlebotomy on this vein, to be very careful and cautious, because there is an artery beneath it; if he errs and misdirects the phlebotomy puncture, he will cut the artery and cause a flood of blood.  Therefore, it is necessary to not phlebotomize it with a sharp phlebotomy instrument, but instead to use a scalpel-like instrument.
And if the basilic vein is not clearly visible, then you should leave it and move to another, or look for a branch of it; or you should perform phlebotomy on the outer part of the arm, for that is visible; and cut it with a scalpel-like phlebotomy instrument, just as we have said.
But if you want to perform phlebotomy on that same vein, then before tightening the arm, you should touch the area until you find the pulse point, and then gently press on it with a finger; then, bind the arm, and cut the vein with a concave cut using a scalpel-like phlebotomy instrument, as we have said; and be careful that the incision avoids any areas near the artery.
And when you, while tightening the ligature, see swelling at the spot you have marked with your finger, then that swelling is swelling of the artery, and thus avoid it.
And if you see blood flowing during the phlebotomy like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and reddish, then know that it is from the artery; then you should stop and place your finger over it for a length of time; then remove your finger, and if the blood flow has stopped, because it often stops, then you should tighten the arm and leave it.
And watch the patient carefully, and be wary of him, and do not neglect him for a few days until he is healed.
But if the blood does not stop flowing, and you realize that there is no immediate remedy for this, then you should cut the artery, if it seems necessary to you; for the flow will become constricted and the blood will stop; or you can take a fig's bark, crush it, and using half of it, bind it to the vein with a tight ligature and some powders until the next day.
And if the blood has stopped, well and good; but if not, then treat it with whatever preceded the remembrance of the powder that stops the flow of blood.
And the stopping of his blood is difficult in many situations because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of the arm being tied up.
However, in the case of the "vena fusca" (a vein in the arm), bloodletting is helpful when you draw blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body, for it is composed of branches of the basilica and cephalic veins, as we have said.
And it is important for the bloodletter to be cautious during the bloodletting, for beneath it lies a nerve; and if, while puncturing, the bloodletter hits the nerve, the patient will experience numbness, and recovery will be difficult, often leaving a permanent scar.  This nerve is often perceptible; but if it's hidden from some people, being subtle and unnoticeable, then it's crucial to position the lancet carefully, cutting with the edge of the lancet to avoid the nerve, and using your skill and strength to do so.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should cut the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of bloodletting from the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and is beneficial for illnesses of the eyes.
And in this case, if you wish to perform bloodletting, use a lancet made of olive wood or myrtle wood; for it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery or nerve below it.
However, it is often difficult to find an abscess in some men, when it is not located at the point of initial percussion, but one should not ignore such an abscess.
The first of these is that you must know that bloodletting is performed only to maintain health and by hoping it will be effective and to avoid the onset of illnesses, and that bloodletting should be done in one of the veins of the elbow, that is: the cephalic, the basilic, and the median cubital; and that bloodletting should be done at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter close to eating, when signs of fullness appear.
And bloodletting should be done on the third day, or at least three hours after the first day.
However, bloodletting, when it is appropriate and necessary, should be administered at any time, night or day, in any hour and season.
And it is necessary that a child not be bled until they are fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman should not be bled until the fourth month and until the seventh, and the elderly who have already passed sixty years should not be bled.
And if someone wants to be bled in any way, it is necessary to cleanse their bowels before the bloodletting with a [cleansing] enema, if there is much retained waste, so that the veins do not draw impurities from the bowels during the bloodletting, which are impure, and that they do not harm the main body parts.
And patients suffering from nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, or recovering from illness or intoxication, should not be bled until this has passed from them, nor patients with dropsy, and furthermore, bloodletting should be avoided in cases of colic, vomiting, abdominal pain, excessive exertion, strenuous work, fasting, or wakefulness, and any condition that weakens the body, whether physical or mental.
And beforehand, consider the thickening of the humors; if the blood is thick, use food and drink, and medicine if possible, to remedy this.
And if no reason prevents it, then enter a bath, or engage in some exercise, so that the blood is made thinner.
And perform the bloodletting on the patient in the morning, around the third hour, as we have said.
And ensure that the patient's feet are protected that day from all harmful animal impulses, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and all bodily ailments, such as excessive work, pain, exertion, and similar issues.
And have present, near the patient, substances used by people for their aromatic qualities and scents, balms, and similar things, according to what is possible.
And have the bloodletter seated on a cushion higher than the cushion of the one who is to be bled.
Then the bloodletter should pull back their arm, and rub the area with their hand two or three times; and then tighten the bandage with a strap and wrap it around twice.
Let the constriction be moderate, for if the constriction is too tight, or if the constriction is accompanied by excess, then you should prohibit the flow of blood; or if it is accompanied by softening, then you should also prohibit the blood's flow excessively.
And then, with the constriction, the person being bled should rub their hands together until the veins become swollen and are clearly visible.
And then the bloodletter should anoint their lancet with a little old oil; and then place their left index finger on the vein, below the spot where they intend to make the incision, so that the vein recedes slightly, and the pulsation stops.  For of the veins it is the one that moves away from the incision like a fleeing heart.  From this one, filled with air, when the lancet is placed on it, is contracted towards the incision, and the bloodletter is thus mistaken; and the lancet does not open the vein, and if it does, it is the wrong vein.
Therefore, for this reason, the bloodletter must be careful and attentive to all these things.
And then apply the lancet again, but if the vein is opened in one attempt, it is good; and if not, you should repeat this another time just below that spot, or a little above it, with haste, if the spot is not inflamed.
And if the spot is inflamed, or the patient becomes frightened, then you should leave it for a day or two, and do not bind the wound tightly, for that will cause the inflammation to rise, nor should they bathe.
And then repeat the bloodletting if necessary.
And if the opening is small and the blood flows subtly, and you fear that not enough blood will come out, then you should repeat the bloodletting at that spot again, making the opening slightly wider, and do so quickly before the area becomes inflamed, for the area often becomes inflamed in many people with even a small opening.
But if the area is already inflamed, then do not repeat the procedure there, for it will not help you in any way; and place a small piece of oil-soaked cloth over it, for this alleviates the flow of blood. And oil is better for this area than other oils.
And similarly, apply oil-soaked bandages to all bloodlettings, with which you open veins to reduce the flow of blood.  Turpentine, laudanum, and saffron are used when one of these is applied to the area, because the blood is thinned and dispersed when it is thick.
And if a large abscess forms at the site of the bloodletting, which often happens, especially in someone who has not been bled before, or when the vein opening is small, then you should treat it.  Place a sponge soaked in warm salt water over the area, and keep it there for an hour.  It will help dissolve the abscess.
And this should be done close to where the blood from that vein exits, with assistance or another vein.
And if some blackness or greenness remains in the area for several days, do not worry about it.  If you wish, apply some aloes and myrrh dissolved, or some mint or balm extract, or something similar to them.
And often abscesses and swellings occur after bloodletting from the basilic vein.
And therefore, place your hand over it.  If, while pressing, you find softness there, then that swelling is bad and harmful; and then be careful to apply something we have mentioned, for easily blood will flow from the artery.
And make a poultice with something astringent, so that the area hardens, and then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And it is necessary to draw blood from each person according to their constitution and according to the color of the blood that appears.
For if the blood is black, then you let it flow until it becomes red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then you let it flow until it becomes thin; and similarly, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is gone.
And it is necessary for one who is full and strong and needs bloodletting in one sitting that the incision into the vein be broadened and that the cut be deep.
And in one who is frail, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to draw blood in several sittings, and the incision should be narrow.
And the best practice in vein bloodletting is that the incision be transverse, not a puncture.
And this method of bloodletting is safer from blood flow and nerve damage, and it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting done along the length and width (or in a longitudinal or latitudinal fashion).
And in those who are prone to fainting during bloodletting, you should treat them beforehand with a small piece of bread soaked in wine of pomegranates or simple heated vinegar; and draw out a small amount of blood in three or four sessions.
And if the condition is one of coldness in the constitution, then before bloodletting, let them consume bread soaked in myrrh syrup or syrup of honey aromatized with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger and similar, or an aromatic and strongly scented syrup.
And if fainting occurs during bloodletting, and it is caused by the outflow of too much blood, then they should drink water of meat and a very fragrant, subtle syrup; and use aromatics with alum, and have their feet soothed with that.
And use the other remedies we have mentioned in the section on fainting due to evacuation (or, in a broader sense, the causes of fainting).
And whoever wants to draw out their arm and dissolve their blood a second time, should have a bloodletting that is a gradual evacuation, and its virtue is slow, evacuating blood little by little, according to the quantity of the virtue over the continuing days.
But if someone wants to draw their arm, and let their blood out a second time, and their body is strong, then do this approximately 7 or 9 hours after the first bloodletting.
But if one wants to draw blood from their body to the contrary of the part to which it inclines, then it should be drawn on the second or third day.
However, if the body has a lot of heated blood, and is afflicted with fever, blood should be drawn from it in one session, in a large quantity, and the procedure should be continued until fainting occurs, provided you have maintained all the conditions of bloodletting; and you should place your hand on the patient's wrist near the body of the blood, to prevent death instead of fainting, for this often happens when the bloodletter is ignorant and negligent.
And when you want to draw the arm and evacuate blood a second time, and the vein's opening is already closed and the blood's release is made difficult, you should not press forcefully on that area and the limb should not be stretched too much, as this is very harmful.
Otherwise, leave it until the bloodletting is done a second time; or remove this with the sharpness of the bloodletting instrument, which has clotted blood in the vein's opening; or place theriac, or sagzenea, on the area, and compress it lightly until the blood has exited.
And if the vein is inflamed/infected, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the inflammation subsides.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then you should draw blood from that spot, or from the other arm, from another vein.
And the vein called the "cord of the arm" is opened for bloodletting instead of the cephalic or basilic veins, when they are not found or are hidden, because it is made up of those.
And the procedure for bloodletting requires the patient to immerse their hand in warm water until the vein becomes red and clearly visible.
And then, press firmly on it with moderate pressure; and then open the vein following the small transverse direction, not laterally or longitudinally.
And if the opening is wide, make your incision for bloodletting just a little above the joint of the hand.
And if the flow of blood is stopped, then you re-immerse the hand in warm water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your desired amount.
However, if it is during the summer days, then you are excused from re-immersion of the hand in warm water, and it is best to immerse the patient's body in warm water in winter.
And bloodletting from this vein is safer than from any other vein, for below it there is no pulsating vein or nerve.
And bloodletting from the vein in the right wrist is beneficial for diseases of the liver.
And the method of bloodletting from that vein is that you grip the hand with a bandage or your hand, after you have placed it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; and then make an incision across the vein; and if you make an incision completely through it, there will be no harm.
And be careful not to injure your hand during the bloodletting, for below it are the nerves of the exposed fingers (lacking protective flesh).
And then return the hand to the warm water and let the blood flow, for if you do not return it to the warm water, the blood will clot in the opening of the vein, and the flow will be impeded.
And when the blood has been drawn according to the necessary amount, then apply oil and salt to the vein so that it does not clot quickly; and similarly, you should do this on any exposed vein.
However, bloodletting from the left hand is beneficial for diseases of the spleen.
And do the same in the bloodletting of him/her, as you did on the other (side).
And the benefit of bloodletting from the saphenous vein is for illnesses in the lower part of the body, such as uterine problems, and retention of menses, and ailments of the kidneys and ulcers of the legs and thighs, and similar illnesses.
And the procedure for bloodletting involves having the patient immerse their foot in hot water and massage it until the veins appear; then bind the area around the ankle with a bandage; and the location of the visible vein, near the specified point, has many branches spreading across the surface of the foot.
And therefore, make the incision on the largest vein, either below the leg towards the ankle, or near its junction, for it is better and more beneficial.
And if you make the incision on the surface of the foot, then you must be careful of the nerves that are underneath on the surface of the foot, and position your incision with the tool you're using to cut across it, as if you were intending to make an incision.
And let the bloodletting be done skillfully.
But if the flow of blood is prohibited, then you should immerse the patient's foot in hot water and allow the blood to drain until it is evacuated.
And if the blood-letter errs in the first attempt, then repeat the bloodletting a little further along, for the spot is beneficial; and do not fear harming the patient, but be careful of the nerves, as we have said.
And similarly do so for the sole of the other foot as well.
And for the sciatic vein, the place, as we have said, is beneath the heel, below the bone of the outside part.
And the benefit of the bloodletting for him is for hip pain when it is caused by hot blood.
And the procedure for his bloodletting is that the patient should enter a bath, and tightly wrap the thigh from the side of the hip, extending above the heel, with a thin long bandage for four days; for it appears only through that.
And therefore, when it appears, then you should perform phlebotomy on that, according to each technique possible to you and following the transverse method, which is better; or cut that by incision, or cut it by section, because the site for him/her is saline.
And it is very hidden in many men; and if you find it, and it does not appear to the touch, then open a branch of it, and it is the one that appears on the back of the foot, near the mentioned auricular and annular areas.
And beware of the nerves, and let the blood flow out in the quantity you want.
And then loosen the constriction and put a compress on the site of the phlebotomy and bind the area tightly, for it is quickly healed.
Of cupping and the qualities of using them.
Cupping is of horns, or of clay, or of glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with incision and extraction of blood, and the other is cupping without incision.
And this cupping that is without incision is in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And to the cupping which is administered with incision and extraction of blood, there are fourteen places on the body, of which the one on which cupping is placed is at the nape of the neck, and it is the back part of the head; and cupping in the middle of the two sides of the neck together; and cupping of the chin below the jaw, below the mouth; and cupping on both shoulder blades; and cupping of the hypochondrium, and it is above the end of the rib cage; and cupping on both sides of the forearms; and cupping on both sides of the shins; and cupping on both thighs.
And cupping does not extract blood from the large veins, but from small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore does not drain the vital force through them, as is the case with bloodletting; neither should cupping be done with fire or without fire in any illness caused by fullness until the entire body is emptied.
But if necessity provokes cupping for illness or for a chronic condition, administer it at any time at the beginning of the month and at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at any time.
And therefore, when in any of those cases, and especially if it is in the third or middle part of the month, then we command that cupping be done after two or three hours have passed.
The benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that when it relieves heaviness in the head and what is pressing on the eyes; however, this should be done after the whole body has been emptied.
And this cupping is in the location of a phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
And it is not permitted to use it on someone with a cold, or on someone with a catarrh, for it would do great harm to them.
And therefore, it should not be used on the elderly, and on those whose illnesses are cold.
But in those who are continuously ill, oblivion is induced; and therefore you must instruct the cupper to place their hand slightly beneath the cupping jar at the lower parts, to prevent the generation of oblivion.
But cupping with alcohol is used in place of phlebotomy of the vena fusca and basilica veins:  and by doing so, it helps with asthma, and constriction of the windpipe and the tearing of the windpipe, and with coughs and congestion.
And the alcohol cupping jar should be raised slightly, for if it is placed too low, it creates weakness in the body and stomach.
And cupping with *alhagdahan* (likely a specific type of cupping or substance used in it) is beneficial for accidental pains in the head, and for ophthalmia, and migraine, and feverishness, and pains in the roots of the teeth; and it is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
And you must instruct the cupper not to press their hand with a cutting action, so as not to cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
And cupping below the chin is helpful for ulcers in the mouth, and for corruption of the gums, and for similar maladies in the mouth, and it takes the place of phlebotomy of the veins that are in the two lips.
But cupping done over the two shoulder blades is beneficial for *caphatan* (a likely medical condition), which is caused by an excess of heat.
And cupping of the two parts inside the armpits is beneficial as a substitute for the phlebotomy of three veins, namely, the basilica, the cephalic and the basilic vein, because it draws blood from all the smaller veins in the flesh, and these smaller veins draw from the larger veins until the drawing is done in the three major veins.
And tell the cupper not to press too hard in cutting, because the area is lacking flesh, and underneath are nerves and arteries.
And there is a cupping that is applied to the buttocks, which is beneficial for hemorrhoids of the anus and for ulcers beneath them.
And it is necessary to instruct the cupper to use a large, strong cupping glass, because the area requires a forceful suction; and flimsy, easily pierced cupping glasses are inappropriate and should not be used, nor should they be slashed/cut with a knife.
However, cupping of the legs is less effective, as it draws blood from the whole body, and it relieves old pains in the kidneys, the liver, and the bladder; and it induces menstruation, and is useful for boils and abscesses; and it can replace bloodletting from two cephalic veins, and then from two arm veins.
However, it greatly weakens the entire body and can cause fainting in many men.
And the benefit from cupping at the armpits is comparable to the benefit of cupping both legs.
And the quality of applying the cupping is to place the cup initially empty and create a moderate suction, and do not prolong the application of the cups, but rather apply them lightly and keep them in place briefly, so that the humors are drawn to the location by a gentle influx. And do not cease repeating this and continuing until you see the area reddening and swelling, and the redness of the blood appearing.
And then you should make incisions and repeat the suction gradually, and then consider the disposition of the body's condition.
For that person with tender, easily bruised flesh, you should only make one incision, lest the area become ulcerated.
And instruct the cupper to deepen the incision slightly, and to moderate the suction gently.
And if the blood is thick, then you should make two incisions, for on the first occasion you open the path for the blood and its watery part to be drawn out. But on the second, by scrutinizing the extraction of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very foul, then a third incision should be made to complete the process.
And finally, when we want to extract little blood gradually, a single incision is sufficient.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we make many incisions; and if we know that the blood is thick, then we should make deep incisions.
And the depth of the incision should be just the thickness of the skin.
And if the skin is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are tight, the places where the cupping glasses are to be applied should be anointed with soothing, opening, and resolving ointments. If it is summer, use oil of rosemary, or oil of violet, or oil of mild almonds, or oil of chamomile seed.  If it is winter, use narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or bloodroot oil, and similar substances.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, then the oil should be of amaranth, or balm, or rosemary, or dill, and similar oils.
But if the cupping is on thin skin with wide pores, then the use of oil should be avoided, and instead the places for the cupping glasses should be washed with lukewarm water or cold water of solanum, or water of chamomile, or water of mint, or similar substances.
And for one whose blood is of moist consistency, wash the cupping sites with sour wine, or water of myrtle and sumac, and similar substances.
And for those with thick superfluities, wash their cupping sites with old wine, or water of tansy (which is majorana), or a decoction of dill, or chamomile, and similar preparations.
And cupping should be avoided before a bath; if administered, it should be close to the bath by one or two hours, and one should rest after the cupping.
What is required to be administered before cupping or bloodletting?
Consider this at the beginning: if the person to be cupped or bled is choleric and has sharp, inflammatory blood, they should take things that cool it, such as pickled cucumbers, endive in sour wine, lettuce, plantain, and juleps, and similar remedies.
And avoid foods like lentils and game birds, and dishes seasoned with acids, and similar foods.
And for someone whose constitution is cold, they should drink licorice syrup, or syrup of cannabis seeds, sumac, and moderately sweet wine; and they should be advised to eat and drink sparingly, avoiding lentil dishes, hemp, pigeons, and small birds, and doves.
And on the day of cupping and bloodletting, the intake of drinks should be greater than the intake of food.
And some men should be given theriac alpharac, or musk-based remedies, or aloes, before cupping or bloodletting, or shortly afterward, so that the major limbs are strengthened and the blood is refined; and they should not consume these remedies while hot.
However, cupping without scarification should be applied to the liver, spleen, gout, the navel, the areas of the knees, and the groin.  These are areas where scarification would not be tolerated.
And these methods are not sought for the removal of blood from a limb, but rather for drawing blood from another part of the body, just as we apply a cupping glass to the breast in cases of nosebleeds; we use this to dispel the cold and viscous wind trapped within the limb, as we would with cupping on the abdomen and navel.  This thins the limb, warms it, and lessens the pain by resolving the wind.
And it is applied to the sinuses when they are congested or filled with phlegm, for by virtue of the strong suction, it quickly opens the congestion and removes the phlegm from its location.
And similarly, it works when placed on the liver and spleen to draw out the wind trapped within them.
And these cupping glasses are applied empty, with suction only; and sometimes they are applied with fire.
And sometimes they are applied filled with lukewarm water, in cases of spleen ailments.
And this is so that the cupping glass is filled and larger; it is either just hot water, or water in which herbs suitable for the purpose have been boiled.
The form of a cupping glass applied with fire:  Let the opening be about two fingers wide, as we have shaped it; and the amount of the fire underneath should be half a palm; and on the patient's side, in the area that is in the middle of the circle,  the hole should be small, as small as an awl could fit through it.
It should be made of smooth, red or citrus wood, with thick, smooth, and even edges so that it does not damage the limb where it is applied.
And there should be a transverse rod of wood or iron in the middle, where a candle is placed with the fire.
And this cupping glass should be larger than the one we have described; and the smaller one should be adjusted according to the illness and the age of the person using it.
The cupping glasses for children and the weak are different from those for young adults and those with strong bodies.
And the method of applying this cupping glass with fire to the limb is to heat the surface with wood fire, gently, in front of a small candle made of wax, and place that on the middle of the transverse rod in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the fire is ignited around the area below, so that the patient's body is not burned.
And then it should be placed on the patient's limb, and the finger should be on the hole we have mentioned, until when we have the cupping glasses and we do not want to see the finger and the vapor escape through that hole, then the cupping glass will immediately be dissolved.
And then ignite the surface according to its manner, and repeat if needed.
But a cupping glass administered for the illness of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse rod or hole, and is not administered unless it is filled with water, and is placed on the limb simply.
And this is its form: and the larger this cupping glass is, the better, because it can receive a greater quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not administered to many limbs, but only to those limbs in which the application of cupping is not possible, due to their small size, such as the foot and the gums and similar parts; or to a limb deprived of flesh, such as the finger and the nose and similar parts.
And the quality to use of those, if you have found leeches in the still waters of muddy places.
And then let them be left in fresh water during the day and night until they are hungry, and that nothing remains in their bellies; and then let the body be emptied at the beginning by phlebotomy and with cupping; and then rub the patient's limb until it turns red; and then place them on it.
And when they are full and bloated.
And if suction of the area with a cupping vessel is possible, it is better for healing.
And if not, then wash the area with sour wine and then with plenty of water; and let it be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the body's blood flow is prolonged during the leeching process, and it is oozing, then you soak a cloth in cool water and place it over the area until the oozing subsides.
And if the bleeding is excessive, then sprinkle crushed vitriol, or other similar styptic substances, on the area until the bleeding stops; or place roasted bean halves over the area and leave them until the beans adhere to the spot, and the bleeding will stop.
And if necessary, repeat the leeching, if possible, changing the leeches.
And if the leeches are prohibited for use, then the area should be rubbed with fresh blood or a needle should be inserted into the area until blood flows; and then, poultices should be applied, because these stick when they sense blood.
And when you want them to fall off, sprinkle a little crushed alum, or salt, or ash, on them, and they will fall off quickly.
Thus begins the treatise of the third part: of restoration. This chapter is very necessary in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of bones that happen by accident.
Oh, son, know that foolish and ignorant physicians, and those who have never looked at the books of the Ancients or read a single letter from them, scoff at this chapter.
And for this reason, this method of the learned in our land is hidden; and I have not forgotten this at all, nor have I adopted this that I have learned, except by the length of my reading of the books of the Ancients and my study on their understanding, until I have extracted the knowledge from them.
And I have devoted myself to experiment and study throughout my life.
And I have already described in this chapter everything that contains my knowledge and upon which my experience has been applied; since I have abbreviated this for you and freed it from lengthy explanation, and I have shortened it in the end, and shown it in the end of its explanation, and I have formed in it many forms of the instruments that are administered to it, as has been done by adding to the explanation, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
First Chapter.
Summaries and collections concerning the nature of bone fractures, and the necessary preliminary steps, before we begin recounting fractured limbs and their various types. Therefore, let us begin this chapter with summaries of the subject matter, and the principles, which practitioners are initially required to understand and abide by, in order to maintain the truth of these matters.  This is for you and those who are ready to learn or teach this noble art.
And therefore I say that when someone suffers a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or injury, then it is necessary for you to begin with bloodletting or other remedies, or both together, unless some cause forbids it, such as weakness of constitution, or if the person affected is a child, or an elderly person in decline, or if the time is one of intense heat, or intense cold.
And afterwards, let the patient's diet consist of cool herbs and the meat of birds and rabbits;  and forbid fatty meats and foods that fill the body, and any food that overloads the veins with blood, until you are sure the inflammation is resolving, and unless you fear an outpouring of matter to the limb.
And then restore the patient to their original regimen, with which they were accustomed.
And so, once the broken bone begins to mend, then it is necessary that the patient eat nutritious foods that are substantial, rich, and heavy, containing viscosity, such as foods made from cooked wheat with water, rice, porridge, and the leg, belly, and other parts of cows, eggs, fresh fish, and thick wines and similar substances; with this regimen, the fracture coagulates more easily and effectively.
And know that broken bones in the elderly and those in poor health, in their first stages of ailment, cannot be rejoined and consolidated according to their natural state because of the dryness of their limbs.
However, nature assembles and brings together over the broken bone from every direction a certain glue-like substance, which is thick and adheres to and tightly binds it until it is completely joined and bound together, until it reaches the point of strength and firmness, just as a fire at the beginning until no cause prevents it from continuing its work.
And for this reason, it is necessary that the patient consumes foods that are heavy, viscous, and substantial, as we have mentioned.
And know that the types of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, for a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the head bone; and a fracture of the foot bone is different from a fracture of the arm bone; and similarly all other limbs differ among themselves.
And I come with a reminder of every type of fracture, explained in its own distinct chapter.
There is diverse kinds of fractures in themselves. And the types of bone fractures themselves are diverse; for there is an arched fracture, another that occurs in star-like patterns; and sometimes a fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and these are fractures of the bones with splinters and pieces, proceeding and non-proceeding, just as it is done in a pen when it is prepared to write, and there is a fracture with a wound and breakage on the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And for every type there is a specific treatment or remedy in restoring it, according to the reminder of it in its place.
Various signs of a fractured bone. And by this a fractured bone is known: there is twisting of it, and a noticeable prominence and appearance of it to the touch, and this is of it when you press it with your hand.
And therefore, when there is no apparent twisting in the area, nor is there a marked change to your touch when you touch the bone with pressure and the patient does not experience significant pain, then it is not a fracture.
However, it is possible that there is twisting or a small fissure, so you should not immediately handle it with your hand and compression.  Instead, place on it some medicines, whose action will remind the body of the appropriate moment for the injury to heal; and then bind it with a gentle bandage.
And know that when the area is bent but not broken in two or otherwise seriously damaged, and the whole part of its structure is retained, then it is necessary to begin the process of straightening it immediately before a harmful abscess develops.
And if a harmful abscess develops, then leave it for a few days until the abscess subsides; and then treat it according to any method you can devise, using gentle and clever techniques.
And know that the repair and mending of the injury is easier than that of a bone that is seriously damaged.
And then bind it tightly until its healing is complete.
However, if the bone is seriously damaged, then extension of the broken limb (whether hand or foot) is necessary, using two people to hold it, or one person's hand if the limb is small, or using two ropes or one rope and a hand.
And be sure that your position when you put the limb back into its natural shape, while the parts of the broken limb are extended, forces you to return those additions with ingenuity and according to any way possible to their places.
And be careful, according to your strength, that you do not cause further pain or injury to the patient through your operation; and use your skill to properly join one bone with its companion according to their best shapes.
And it is necessary that at that time you diligently feel it with your hand, and if you find any other cause, correct it and fix it with all your skill.
Avoid excessive extension and compression, as some foolish doctors often cause abscesses or contraction in the limb through their practices, as we have seen in their frequent operations.
And the required degree of immobilization for the calmed limb is what I recommend; so that you understand that broken limbs vary in size and form.
And for those that are small, like the arm, finger, or similar, then the wrapping should be with fine, soft cloth.
However, for those that are large, such as the thigh or leg, the wrapping should be firm and strong, for a firm bandage joins the large limb and tightly compresses it from all sides, so that no swelling enters.
And then begin, with your alignment, applying a suitable bandage to the fracture site with three or four wraps, depending on the limb's needs; and tighten your hand slightly on the bandage.
And then bring it to the highest part of the fracture site, and tighten less than you did with the original tightening of the fracture site. And then gently lengthen the wrapping of the fracture site a little, and gradually loosen the tightening, until you have taken a good portion of the swelling out.
And then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken site with a bandage, and then bring the wraps to the lowest part of the fracture; and let your procedure consist in tightening the bandage and loosening it, just as we said in the first bandage above.
And then place between the wraps a piece of linen or cloth, with which the curvature of the fracture is aligned, if there is a curvature there; and if not, do not place anything there.
And then place another bandage over this, and then firmly wrap these bandages, properly made, immediately if there is no inflammation or hot abscess in the area, and if there is, place on it that which relieves the abscess and removes the inflammation; and leave that for a few days; and then you tighten the bandages over it.
And the splints should be made of half a cane or similar wood, and well-shaped skillfully; or of pine wood; or of palm branches; and let the width of each splint be according to this form and this figure:
However, the splint placed over the fracture should be slightly larger and wider than the other splints, and the splint's length should correspond to the limb's size; and then tighten the splints with another bandage, according to your initial tightening; and then tie it securely on top with thread, as we said about tightening, and it is important that your tightening is specific to the location of the fracture, and the further it extends from the fracture, the less the tightening should be.
And it is necessary that the threads be medium in thickness and thinness, and be of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen by the operation of some foolish people who used their thick ropes for thread, it is a great error, because the tightening loses its equal distribution.
Likewise, excessively thin threads are not suitable, for you will not be able to tighten properly with them, and it is not appropriate for there to be less than a finger's width between splint and splint.
And if the patient is irritated by the ends of the splints near the tightening at those places, then place some soft linen or carded wool under those ends to prevent them from causing injury.
Sometimes a fracture occurs with a contusion, and there is a disruption in the continuity, and I will return to this with a detailed description in the following chapter.
And know that any broken limb is not tightly bound with splints on the first day; the reason for this is that when a limb is severely injured, one should not apply splints until approximately five or seven days, or more, depending on your assessment of the likelihood of a suppurative inflammation developing.
And this is the method of plasters with which the ancients restored fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
Method of a common plaster for the restoration of fractures, suitable for many constitutions, and especially for women and children, as it does not cause heat or cold: take powdered flour, and this is the medulla of the flour that falls from the movement of the millstone on the walls of the mill.
And mix it like this, but sift it with egg white, and make a paste of it that is not thick nor thin; and then apply it.
Another method of plaster for restoring fractures, dislocations, and sprains:  a recipe using asafoetida, opoponax, acacia, elecampane, and wild millet root,  all equal parts [by weight].  Also, frankincense and myrrh, five parts each; and aloes, twenty parts [by weight]. All should be ground and sifted, and mixed with water or egg white if the patient's constitution is warm. Then apply this plaster, as it is a good compound and restores slightly fractured bones, and is beneficial for many people.
Another method of plaster, beneficial for fractures and sprains:  a recipe using wild millet root and white marshmallow root, equal parts [by weight].  Also, frankincense and myrrh, five parts each; acacia, six parts; and Armenian bole, twenty parts [by weight].
All are ground in a mortar with thorough grinding, and sifted, and mixed with water or egg white, and then applied.
A method of plaster for joints and bones dislocated from their places, and for pain and fissures/fractures occurring there: take wool, soak it in sour wine and boiled oil, and place it over the affected area.
However, this plaster does not have the virtue of restoration, but is useful for treating suppurative boils and expelling pain directly.
Another method of plaster to restore a broken bone: take leaves of wild fig and leaves of wild poppy; grind them together and make a plaster from them.
A brief method of plaster for the restoration of a broken bone, and when you want the resolution of remaining suppuration: take roots of marshmallow, chamomile, violet flowers, and the flour of comfrey; grind all into a fine powder, mix together, and then add wine to it if the affected limb is not inflamed.
However, if it is inflamed, then mix it with moistened coriander water or simply water and use it.
Another method of plaster, even stronger in resolving suppuration than the first, when dealing with a hard boil hindering the restoration of the limb: take the roots of marshmallow, flaxseed, balm, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile; all into a fine powder; mix them together and add either willow water, plain water, or wine, depending on the nature of the limb and the colour to promote healing.
However, Hippocrates, in his book, did not say that a plaster should be applied to a fractured limb to restore it, but rather a cerot (plaster) made from wax and oil, and nothing else; and recommended that it be of a medium consistency, neither too thick nor too thin.
However, in Gaul, it is customary to apply plasters to broken limbs during their restoration, and for cases where there's desiccation with little heat, using substances such as myrrh, frankincense, and similar to those already mentioned.
A method of plaster for wounds and pain: take equal parts of crushed figs, human or bird skin (or a similar substitute), marshmallow, and salt; grind them, sieve the mixture, and form a plaster.
However, the length of time the bandage should remain on, and when to remove it, is dependent on whether there is pain, swelling or if the bone is fractured and out of place.  In these cases, you should not remove it for several days. And if, at the site, there is intense pain, swelling, or inflammation, then you should take it off immediately and remove the plaster.
And take linen cloth and a wet sea sponge, and immerse it in lukewarm water, and with this wash the area until the swelling subsides and the pain is eased; then allow the limb to rest for an hour.  Then place on it wool soaked in vinegar and oil or olive oil, and bandage it for a night, so you are sure to resolve any festering, and that the inflammation of the limb subsides and the pain is relieved.
Then repeat this subtle compression and small plastering, and do not apply it with your first strong pressure, but gradually to achieve healing.
And if the abscess, hardness, pain, inflammation, and all the other symptoms are completely gone, and you no longer need plaster and compression, then you repeat this process as you did at the beginning.
And if no such causes as we have mentioned affect the limb, then do not remove it for three to four, five, or seven days; and sometimes it is left for twenty days, according to how the limb heals, as we have said, until the fracture adheres and the flesh around it coagulates.
Then, increase the compression more than your initial compression, and increase the patient's food intake, in accordance with the patient's recovery.
But if you find the fracture site already drying out and weakening more than necessary, know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it. Therefore, moisten the area with lukewarm water every time you remove it, and do this for three days.  Slightly loosen the compression, and through this operation, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly.
However, what those foolish bone-setters do in a fractured limb a second time, when it has not been properly set the first time, and they set it according to a crooked method, is an error in their procedure, and a great fear.  If they were right, the ancients would have enlarged upon it in their books and would have worked in this way.
And I have not seen anyone of them do this, which makes it more reasonable that it should not be done.
Second Chapter: Of fractures when they occur to the head.
The types of fractures are numerous, and their shapes are diverse, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are caused by a blow with a blunt instrument, and the blow crushes all the bone down to the skull, as is done in a tree trunk.  Thus, this type is called a comminuted fracture; or the blow cuts a portion of the bone and cuts the flesh, but does not penetrate to the back of the bone; and this type of fracture is called an incomplete fracture.
And the severity of these two types of fractures is great or small, and a fracture that is a crushing or a grinding; and its cause is a blow with a blunt object or falling on a stone, and similar causes.
And this fracture is either penetrating, approaching the membrane beneath the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone, and the severity of these two fractures is either great or small.
And there is a fracture that is hidden within the bone, in the subtle smallness of a hair, and thus this type is called a hairline fracture.
And a fracture is made either by falling or by a blow from a stone or similar objects, which causes a portion of the bone to splinter inward, and is made in the concave part, just as happens to the ribs when they are struck, and is fractured from the point of entry inward.
This happens most often in the bones of moist bodies, such as the heads of children.
And in all these types of fractures, the fragments, or pieces, are like separated stars. And I will come with a remedy for all of that, putting it back in place.
And we recognize all these types of fractures by probing them and by investigating them with the probes and by examining the decaying flesh that is over them.
A fracture is recognized because it is revealed on the bone, cleaned, and probed over it, for the fracture appears black.
But in the treatment of fractures, consider first the patient's symptoms, and if you observe, through the symptoms, a clear indication of danger, such as vomiting of bile, convulsions, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, and swelling and stiffness of the affected areas, and similar symptoms in more severe cases, without a doubt, it is not going to be cured.
And if you observe non-dangerous symptoms, you expect recovery, then you begin the treatment.
The reason for this is that if the fractured person comes to you at the beginning of the illness, and this is during the winter months, then you should study the condition of the bone before the 14th day, according to all circumstances.
And if it is during the summer months, then you must try to set the bone before the 7th day, lest the area under the bone be corrupted by inflammation, and the symptoms we have mentioned arise.
And if the fracture has already reached the inflamed tissue covering the brain, and is with shattered and crushed parts, then you must cut away the broken and crushed parts, as I will instruct you.
And you must shave the head of the injured patient, and expose the bone according to the custom and method possible to you, according to the nature of the injury, and be gentle with the patient.
And if you encounter a bone protrusion, blood flow, or a hot abscess, then you should counteract it with what is necessary, and you should fill the area with cloths soaked in wine and rubbed oil, and let the injury rest until the abscess subsides and the blood flow stops; then begin work on the circulation of the bone and its removal.
And this should be done according to one of two surgical methods.
And one method is that you cut the bone with a narrow-bladed scalpel, and this is the way to do it:  And then you place another scalpel, a little wider than the first; and this is how to do it:
And then place a scalpel even wider than the second one.
And it is necessary for you to have several different scalpels, some wider than others, and some shorter than others, sharpened at the tips of their edges, and made of tempered or hardened steel.
And use them with ease in striking the scalpel, so that it does not strike the head and break it.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then it is necessary to bore around it before you apply the scalpels with the drills, which are called non-deepening drills.
And they are not called that (non-deepening) because they do not reach the edge of the bone that surrounds it, because the drill has a rounded tip or edge, which is below the sharp head-like edge or small circle, which prevents it from sinking and going through the thickness of the bone.
And it is advisable that you take a large number of these drills, each suited to the thickness of each bone, so that you have on hand, for every skull, a drill whose tip is sharp, and the length and shortness are according to the thickness of that particular skull.
And this is the method for three types of drills: The way to bore around a broken bone is to place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is penetrated; then change the drill to another spot and put in a drill of the same size of the bone's thickness (or close to it) between the holes.
Then, with the scalpels, cut what is between each hole in the bone, making it as thin as possible, as we have said, until you have removed the bone, either with your hand, or with some other tool such as tweezers or fine forceps.
And you must carefully ensure that the scalpel does not touch any part of the skull.
And then, once you have bored around the bone and it is separated from the skull if they are joined, and you have extracted it, you must rasp and smooth the rough surface of the bone with another tool similar to a scalpel, but it must be finer and more delicate than the other scalpels.
And if any small pieces of bone remain, then easily remove them with tools at your disposal; then treat the wound with liniments and ointments as we have described.
Another method of operation is gentle, free of fear, which Gualia described and praised greatly.  This is his statement:  It is necessary for you at the beginning to start exposing the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most severe and most apparent, until when you have uncovered that part and have placed below it the tip of this gentle and joyful scalpel, of which this is the form:
And it is that the lenticular part is smooth and does not cut anything, and the pointed part has two edges in front extending in length, as you see; so that the lenticular part is attached to the skull with the pointed cutting edge against the bone.
Then strike the scalpel on one edge with a small mallet until you have cut through the entire bone easily, as it turns, and you can be sure of the outcome without any accidents that you might fear. And even if the physician were the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of their craft, certainly if he were asleep...
Then, if any remains attached to the bone, in certain places of the bone,  cut it off with the lenticular tip of the scalpel, and deliver it easily, for it is released without harm or fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate into the flesh, and that which is cut off or removed from the bone is its surface, and roughnesses and fine irregularities remain there, then it is necessary to smooth out those roughnesses and eliminate those irregularities with fine razors, for which you have prepared various sizes, so that you can apply the most suitable and straightest ones according to the part of the broken bone and its shape.
And you must use the widest razors initially in your procedure to smooth the bone, then gradually use the finer ones, and do not stop doing so until you have used the thinnest and finest of them all.
However, for each of the other smaller, capillary fractures and subtle breaks, you must administer treatment according to what you find to be necessary for their repair.
And this is a cause that is not hidden from all those who have studied this art. And what we have written here pertains to large fractures.
And if the pannicle (skin) is pulled tight when you expose the bone, then you must take a cloth according to the size of the wound, and soak it in warmed oil, and place it over the wound opening; then take another cloth, folded once or twice, and soak it in wine and warmed oil, and place this over the first cloth, applying it as gently as possible so as not to compress the skin; and then apply a wide bandage, and do not tighten it beyond the point that it simply holds the wound closed.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two, until you are certain of a heat inflammation; then remove it, and then administer remedies for dryness, such as flax roots, powdered herbs, and ashes, or similar substances.
And you should make these remedies into a powder that is sprinkled on the wound, in their dried state; and universally, apply any medicine that has the property of cleansing, but not of stinging or causing pain.
And be careful, according to your skill, that the wound is clean during its treatment, and is not covered in any ointments or other impurities; nor do you allow virulence to accumulate there, for when it is concentrated on the brain's membranes, it will corrupt and weaken them, and thus cause the patient great, harmful harm.
And you will cause harm to the skin of the head, especially when the bone is exposed and the treatment is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface;  and therefore, if you see the patient exhibiting the symptoms we have described, know that it is dangerous without a doubt.
And if the blackness is not from the wound itself but from the medicine applied, and if the medicine is causing that blackness, then you should take one part honey and three parts of rubbed olive oil, and with these, moisten a cloth, and apply it to the scalp; and then treat it with appropriate healing methods until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Of the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken in two parts simultaneously, but rather one of those parts sometimes, because there are two bones there; for the lower part is cartilaginous and is not broken, and harm is caused only by bruising, twisting, and crookedness.
But if one of the two parts is broken, then you should insert your little finger into the nose, and use your index finger to push the fracture inward, and your thumb outward, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And do this with ease, and be careful not to cause further pain to the patient with your actions.
And if the fracture is in the most superior part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it, then it must be adjusted with the end of a rod, which should be of small thickness.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then do likewise.
And try to restore it on the first day of the fracture, if possible; and if not, then approximately the seventh or tenth day you should rest the suppurating wound.
And approximately insert a piece of linen cloth into the end of the nose, if the fracture is in one part, or place two pieces, if the fracture is in two parts, and the thickness of the piece should be so great as to fill the nasal passage.
And some of the ancient restorers say that the pieces should be soaked in wine, and be changed every day, but I do not see the need for this.  Instead, I recommend that the piece be soaked in a beaten egg mixture with ground spice; and leave it in place until the bone is set and the cartilage is hardened.
And sometimes, instead of a piece of cloth, a bird's feather is placed in the nose, wrapped in linen, if the nasal fracture is severe and the patient is unable to breathe normally.
And this method is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do this, and if you wish, use the pieces of cloth.
And if another time a boil appears on the nose, plaster it with a cerate or with cotton soaked in sour wine and rubbed oil, or with diachylon.
But if a hot boil does not appear, then you should plaster the exterior with chickpea flour and ground herbs mixed with beaten egg; and then place a linen bandage over it, and do not bind the nose with anything else.
But if the nasal bones are fractured, either a small fracture or comminuted, then you must cut away the pieces and remove them with appropriate instruments; and then close the wound, healing it with what promotes flesh and consolidation, and with appropriate plasters.
And if a boil occurs *inside* the nose, then you should treat it with pieces of cloth and administer lead cannulae until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
Concerning the restoration of the jaw when it is broken.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by an open wound, observe if the fracture is only outward, and not broken in two but bent inward, then its recognition is straightforward.
And thus, if the fracture is on the right side, you should introduce your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is on the left side of the jaw, then introduce the aforementioned index finger of your right hand; and with that, push the protrusion of the fracture inward easily to the outer edges, with your other hand on the outside of the bone; with this, gently straighten it.
And if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to administer extension of both parts according to their alignment until its re-alignment is possible.
And if you encounter a displacement of teeth with a rupture, then bind those that you expect to remain with gold, silver, or silk thread; and then place a compress on the fractured jaw, and then place a doubled cloth upon it, and place a large, properly made bandage, or a piece of linen the length of the jaw over it; and then bind that above it according to your skill in bandaging and the appropriate application, until it is not dislodged.
And command the patient to use rest and tranquility, and give him food that is easily digestible.
And if you estimate that the shape has been altered in any way, then you should remove and loosen it on the third day; and then correct what has been altered in it and plaster it with ground chalk, with egg white, or with sifted flour, after you have removed the compress, and place a soft wool plaster over it.
And then, when that plaster is securely fixed in place, and the bone's position is not altered, leave it, do not remove it until the fracture is healed and tight; for often this fracture is tightened within three weeks.
And if, another time, a harmful abscess occurs, then administer what we have said many times for its treatment until it is healed, and the abscess is resolved.
And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, then consider if it is a detached piece of bone or splinters; then you must carefully remove those splinters with what is appropriate for removing such splinters from the wound.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should widen it with leeches, according to the extent of your need.
And then, when you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains of them, then you should close the wound opening if it is wide; and if not, place one of the appropriate plasters over it and allow it to heal until it is sound.
Chapter 5.
Of the restoration of the collarbone when it is fractured.
Often the collarbone is fractured near the muscle, and this fracture occurs in one of three ways.
When it is broken, or separated, or separated into two parts without splinters; and it is easy to restore it; or it happens with splinters, and it is difficult to restore it; or the fracture is with a wound.
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds and steadies the fractured collarbone, and the other extends the arm towards that area.
And then gently mold the fracture with your fingers until it is in the correct shape, neither protruding nor sunken.
And if you need more extension, then you should place under the patient's armpit a pad of cloth or wool, and its size should be according to your needs; and extend and elevate the collarbone and compress the pad with your hand until you have aligned the fracture correctly.
And if you cannot pull the collarbone's ends outward, because it has been pushed inward, then the patient should be laid supine on their neck, and you should place a cushion of moderate size on the muscle of their neck.
And the assistant should press on the muscle below, until the collarbone bone is lifted out of the depression, and then you should straighten the fracture and mold it with your fingers.
But if you feel splinters of the collarbone and they are sharp, then it is necessary to break them and easily remove those splinters.
And if it is lodged within the bone, then you should make an incision there with one of the scalpels you have prepared for this, after you have placed under the collarbone the instrument that serves for the saw; and it is an instrument of wood or iron of which this is its shape:
And it is similar to a scoop, of which this is the concavity; and let its width be according to your need, according to the size of the bone or its smallness.
But its length should be as much as possible for the operation; let it have two ends, as often, and one end be wide and the other narrow.
And if the opening of the wound which you have incised when you have removed the splinter from the bone is wide, and you are sure of a hot abscess, then you should close the two edges of the wound with stitches.
And if the opening is small, or you fear a hot abscess, then you should fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the wound's cut.
And if a hot abscess arises, then soak a cloth in sour wine, and rubbed oil and wine, and place it over it.
And be careful that the splint does not move from the broken bone; therefore, you must see the patient daily. When the ligaments have softened, or you see the splint has moved, then you must readjust and tighten the bandage.
Then place the patient's bedding over their neck, and place a small cushion under their armpit near their bedding at night, so that their shoulder is raised away from the injury, thus elevating the fractured collarbone from the muscle, or keeping the patient's arm bound to their neck.
Do not loosen the bandage unless there is swelling or an abscess in the area within twelve days.
And then renew the plaster if you see the area needing it, and adjust the splint and restore it, and leave it until the fracture of the collarbone is restored and has healed.
And it is strengthened and comfortable within twenty-eight days, and sometimes in some people it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Of the restoration of a shoulder fracture.
The shoulder blade is fractured at the lateral side and it is not broken into pieces but just the edges.
And therefore, when the location of the fracture is broken - and it is broken in the middle of the bone - and it is not known except by touch, then, depending on the nature of the fracture, prepare the area and reduce it to its natural shape using every possible method.
Then place on the area powder of pounded chalk with egg white and a little lint; then place a double layer of cloth; and then place a thin, flat piece of wood (or possibly a sliver of table) over it, roughly the size of the shoulder blade or a bit larger.
But if beneath the wood there is a hollow in any part of the shoulder blade, then you fill that hollow with lint, and then raise the board to an even level.
And then press firmly from above with a long, appropriate constriction, and with firmness on the board, until it is no longer displaced from its position.
And check the ligament every day; and every time it is softened, bandage it again, and reposition the board if it has shifted from its place.
And have the patient lie on their healthy side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in 20 or 25 days.
And therefore, when this number of days is complete, then you dissolve the bandage, and be sure that the connection is to the bones, from which the breaking is not feared, nor their dissolution.
And if you proceed from the site of the heavy bone and place the splint beneath it, then you cut on it, remove it, and do as we have said in the fracture of the furcula, regarding the treatment of a boil or abscess if one arises there.
Chapter 7.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the foot.
The foot sometimes is broken in the middle, and that is bad; but its extremities are worse, because they are crushed and fragmented.
And the complications when it is broken in the middle are that it declines to the inner parts, causing great pain, difficulty breathing, coughing, severe weakness, and vomiting blood; and the cavity in the broken bone is apparent, not hidden from sensation.
And the restoration of it is to lay the patient on their back, and place a cushion between their shoulders; and then press on the muscles, and adjust the bones with the hands on both sides, and be subtle in the operation and in the application according to any way possible and suitable, until the bone returns to its proper form.
And then apply a plaster and bandage and place a thin sheet of willow or rush or similar materials on top, wrapped in cloth; and be subtle in binding it over the broken bone so it is not moved; and tie it around the back in a circular fashion sometimes, and tighten it properly; and then check the bandage at all times, and when it has softened, tighten it further.
And if necessity provokes loosening due to corrosion, swelling, pain, or abscess that occurs in the area, then you should loosen it, remove the plaster, and correct whatever happened by applying a healing method; and then reapply the plaster, if necessary, and adjust the tightness until it is healed.
Chapter 8.
Of the restoration of bones when they are broken.
Know that fractures of the ribs only occur in thick parts, meaning the middle; and on the extremities/ends of their front portions, damage occurs only because they are cartilaginous. And knowledge of it is not hidden from the feeling through inquiry into it using words.
And the restoration should be such that the fracture is aligned with words (i.e., by using the appropriate method), until it is properly set, then apply a plaster and bind the broken bone with a splint, if needed.
And if the rib fracture is descending towards the internal parts, then the patient experiences intense pain and stabbing, similar to the pain experienced by someone with pleurisy, because the bone pierces the membrane; and difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting blood result; and this is a difficult condition to cure.
And the ancients were ingenious in dealing with this (condition) with many devices.
And from their observations, they said: It is necessary to withhold food from the patient that causes inflammation and flatulence, so that the belly is inflated and distended, and the fracture is pushed outward.
However, we should avoid this (withholding food) lest it be a trivial cause of generating a severe abscess, if it does not occur; and if it has already occurred, then it is helpful.
And some of them would say that it should be placed over a cupping glass and then suctioned forcefully; and it seems a reasonable approach, but nonetheless, it is feared that the cupping glass will draw the superfluities to the site due to the weakness (of the patient).
And some of them would say: the area should be covered with wool soaked in warm oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs until it is full, and the dressing should be tightly bound around the curvature; and then the patient should be treated with a pleurisy-like treatment of diet and medicine.
And if a severe injury causes the patient extreme suffering, and the bone pierces the skin with a painful puncture, we are concerned for the patient; then, we must cut open the area, expose the fractured rib, and then place an instrument there to support the fractured section, a method of which has been preceded, and then cut the bone easily and remove it.
And then, if the wound is large, we should bring the two edges of the wound together with stitches, and treat it with poultices until it is healed.
And if an abscess arises inside, then you should mix powders in rubbed oil and place it on the affected area, and the patient should be treated with whatever is appropriate for an internal abscess.
And let him lie on his side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the restoration of fractures of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Sometimes there are fractures in the bones of the neck, and sometimes they cause attrition, and similarly in the vertebrae of the back. And if this happens to someone and you want to know if they will be healed or not, then consider this: if you repeatedly press their hands, they are now softened, numb, dead, and cannot be moved, stretched, or squeezed, and when you press them with your fingers or prick them with a needle, they feel no pain, then know that they are not healed and in that condition, it is fatal.
And if you move them and feel constriction with your fingers and pricking, then know that the bone's integrity is preserved and that the patient can be cured with treatment.
And if you see something similar in the vertebrae of the neck and want to know if it will be healed or not, then consider the patient's feet.
Then if you see that the feet are also numb, as was observed in the hands, and when lying on their back, they experience involuntary windiness or urination, and sometimes they are lying on their back, wanting to urinate but unable, then know that it is fatal, and thus do not work on their cure.
But if no such symptoms appear in them, the condition is better and less severe.
And the treatment for this is to apply a soothing poultice, either of heated oil or crushed eggs, to the affected vertebra.  Apply it several times a day until the inflamed area subsides.
And then apply a comforting and stimulating plaster, and bind it tightly.  Instruct the patient to rest and remain calm, and not to sleep on the affected area until healed.
And if you observe bone splintering or any other separated fragment, then it is necessary to expose the wound and remove the bone.  Then, bring the edges of the wound together, with sutures if necessary, and treat with a healing ointment until healed.
But if the tailbone is fractured, and the coccyx is affected, then you should insert the index finger of your left hand into the rectum, and align the fractured bone with the other hand as best as possible through repositioning; and then apply a plaster and bandage, if necessary, and tightly bind it.
And if you find fractured splinters there, then remove them, and treat the wound with the previous method until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the restoration of the width/broadness (or perhaps "the breadth").
The bones of the hips are often fractured, and if they break, the fracture is typically only a separation of their ends, and they are jagged along their length and move apart;  the patient experiences pain and throbbing at the site, and the leg becomes numb when fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it until it is over the fracture, which is the shape of it.
And if the fracture is only at its end, then you align it according to your equipment for alignment until it is brought back to its natural shape.
But if the fracture is along its length or has already moved apart, then you have the patient lie on their stomach until you are ready to repair that fracture. And then, once you have aligned it, apply a plaster, and then place a splint of wood or bone over it, and bind it tightly, so you do not fear further fracturing or dislodging the splint.
And align the concave part with whatever fills it until it takes the binding according to equality, and command the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
But if a festering abscess occurs, then you cease the extension and repair until the festering abscess is soothed, and apply what will soothe it as previously described; and then return to the repair, and bind it as is proper.
And if the bones splinter or are comminuted, then you must set them.
Chapter 11.
Of the repair of a fractured limb.
Adjutori" is that which is between the elbow and the shoulder joint.
And if it is broken, then its repair is in one of two ways, of which one is that you take a piece of wood of medium thickness in this manner:
And tie two ligatures at both ends, and then suspend it from a raised position.
And place the patient on a bed; and then place the patient's broken arm on the wood until the point of the arm is in the middle of the area where the curve of the wood is attached.
And then suspend something heavy over it, or the attendant stretches it downwards; and then the physician holds the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns as it should.
The other method is that the patient is placed on their back, and the hand of their neck is suspended with a ligature; and then command two attendants that one of them holds what is above the fracture with their hands; and the other holds what is below it; and each of them stretches it in their direction.
And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then you tighten a ligature over the fracture and another ligature over that, and each of the two attendants stretches in their respective directions.
And therefore, if the fracture is close to the extremity of the muscle, then it is necessary that half of the ligature be placed on the point, and the other below the fracture towards the elbow.
And similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that the ligature be placed over that spot and over that elbow.
Apply it easily and without effort, and then, once it is bound as necessary and applied with good application, tighten it if you do not want a festering boil.
But if a festering boil occurs, then leave the constriction until the seventh day, and place on it wool soaked in sour wine and rubbed oil until the boil subsides, and then tighten it.
And the way to tighten it is to place a plaster over the fracture, then a bandage of fresh cloth over the plaster; then adjust the arm onto this support, and place their open hand over their muscle.
And place the cloth and tighten the support on the arm so that the arm is in its proper place, if nothing about the broken bone prevents this.
And then use splints.
And you should place on the fracture that splint which is widest and strongest of the other splints; and place the width of a finger between each splint, and let the length of the splints be according to the break, with an addition of three fingers on each side.
And then tighten the splints with the constriction which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And make sure your constriction over the fracture area is tighter. And the longer the fracture, the smaller the constriction should be.
And therefore, adjust the positioning of the splints and the constriction as we have described earlier, when you are returning the limb to its proper position, then you do so.
And if you fear a suppurating abscess, then you leave the constriction and splints in place for seven days, as we have said.
And now consider the ligament in all its parts for three days, so that no swelling or inflammation occurs in the area; or, the member should be deprived of food to avoid the excess of the constriction; and thus correct all of this as we have said.
But if you are confident that no such cause will arise, then do not loosen the bandage until approximately three days or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on their back, and their hands on their stomach.
And place a full, wool-stuffed pad beneath the injured area, and constantly during the night or day, ensure that the shape of the broken limb is not distorted or its ligaments weakened; therefore, remedy all of this with your skill.
And provide the patient with food according to the previous instructions, so that the food is light at first until the healing begins to strengthen; and then you should increase the amount of food.
Because it is customary for the injured area and leg to be bandaged for 40 days; and then they should be unbandaged, and a bath should be administered, and medicated with ointments that restore it.
And if the fracture is severely inflamed, then you do not loosen the ligaments and splints until after a few days or until two months have passed.
Chapter 12.
Of the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two forearm bones; one of which is small, and is the one that sits beside the said elbow, and the other is large and is the one that is situated below the smaller bone, in the lower part.
And frequently the larger forearm bone is broken alone, or the smaller one, and frequently both are broken together.
And when the smaller forearm bone is broken above, then the restoration of it is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the forearm bone is broken below the fracture, its restoration is difficult, and its healing is difficult.
And even more difficult than that is when both bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the smaller forearm bone above, then it is appropriate for the physician, during its restoration, to apply a small extension with ease until it is healed.
But if the larger forearm bone is broken, then it requires a more forceful extension.
And if both forearm bones are broken together, then you must apply the pressure much more strongly.
And you must place the figure of the hand during the restoration and extension of it, laid out on a cushion, with the wrist of the hand positioned above the other fingers, the index finger being lower than the other fingers, and the patient resting on a smoothed-out board/surface.
And there should be a cushion in front of him, at the same height or level, so that the patient does not experience discomfort.
Then the assistant extends the lower part of the arm with their hand or a bandage, and another assistant extends the upper part similarly.
And then the physician manipulates the bone until it returns to the best possible position.
And if the fracture of the bone is complex, then you must exert your strength to return every piece to its proper place.
And if there appears a separated fragment that pierces the skin and you are not hopeful of restoring it, then you must operate on it and remove it by the method previously described.
But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter on this, and therefore take care of this healing.
And if a pus-filled abscess arises at the beginning of your treatment, then you should line a cloth with a plaster made of rosemary oil and white wax, with moderate thickness and subtlety, and firmly bind the cloth over it until the abscess subsides; then remove the plaster and apply a prepared plaster of ground powder mixed with egg white, and then apply splints; and let the splint placed on that fracture be thick and strong.
And know that the names of the splints for the arm are varied in the different arrangements, meaning a fracture in one or two segments at the same time.
And then apply your bandage to the site of the fracture more firmly and vigorously, and the more the bandage is drawn on the upper or lower parts of the fracture, the more softly you should apply the bandage, according to what is previously mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And the cloths wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist, not hard or rough, and the bandage with which they are bound should be of moderate thickness between thin and thick, as we have previously described.
And consider the limb and its ligaments for several days. And if any cause arises requiring correction, such as swelling affecting the limb, then you must bathe the limb in warm water until the swelling subsides.
And leave the limb unconstrained until it rests, and then reapply the bandage.
And if the bandage is already softened and the bone is already repositioned and similar to the others, then rectify everything with your skill.
And further consider if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightness of the bandage, for then you must soften it slightly and leave it for several days until nourishment flows to it, and then tighten it again.
But if the patient experiences no such causes as we have described, then it is not necessary to loosen it for approximately 20 days or thereabouts.
And then the patient's hand should be suspended by its power of active movement, and let them sleep on their back.
And know that this fracture is restored in 30 days or 32 days, or a very easy one is restored in 28 days, and all this depends on the constitution and the strength of the body.
Chapter 13.
Of the restoration of fractures of the wrist and fingers.
Know that the wrist and the joints of the fingers are often fractured, and not only by accidents, but also frequently by excessive friction.
And when the hand is fractured or injured through friction, the patient should be kept still, and a bandage should be applied evenly to the area.  Then the patient's hand should be placed on a similar extended position.
Then the attendant should straighten the broken bones, and the physician should hold them together until they are firmly rejoined.
And then a poultice and bandage should be applied, lest an abscess arise;  then place a splint over it, proportionate to the affected area, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
But if the fracture is in the parts inside the palm of the hand, then make a kind of sling out of cloth, and tell the patient to hold it tight with their fractured palm;  then wrap it firmly with a long piece of cloth.
And let the splint be of leather covered with cloth, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and hold it tight as necessary.
But if the fracture is in the outer parts, then you must place a splint over it, and another splint underneath on the palm of the hand, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply a bandage, winding the hand back towards the fingers, with ligaments.
And if a fracture occurs in any of the fingers, if it is the thumb, it should be wrapped as needed and then held by the palm; and if you wish, put a small, straight splint on it so that the fracture is elevated and does not move.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle finger, or the index finger, or the ring finger, or the little finger, then it should be wrapped and bound to the adjacent finger; or all of them should be bound together sequentially, and this is better; or place a small splint on it, as we said about the thumb.
And consider, in your treatment, and after that, the disposition of a hot abscess and oppose it — with your operation — with what is necessary when any of those causes occur, according to how the narrative of it is repeated.
Chapter 14.
Of the treatment of a fractured thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often broken and is declared to be broken according to whether it is displaced forward and most severely.
And its treatment is done by tightening a bandage over the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, and the patient should be laid on their stomach and on their face.
And then the attendant should extend the entire bandage to its proper position, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is close to the root of the thigh, then let the bandage be close to the knee in the direction of the hip joint, so that the extension is upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.
And similarly, if the break is close to the knee, then let the bandage be near the knee, and the extension be downwards.
And then the physician aligns the bone with both his hands until it returns to its natural shape and the bone is properly joined; then it is necessary to apply a plaster and a bandage, otherwise the limb is at risk of developing an abscess. But if an abscess develops, then you should leave it for a few days until the hot abscess subsides, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be applied like this: it is necessary to wrap a hard bandage around the fracture, fold it two or three times, and remove any excess; then wrap the leg until it reaches the ankle and the root of the thigh.
And insert a long splint between the thigh and the leg near the knee, downwards, and let the ends of the splint extend from the most prominent parts of both, then wrap the excess of the bandage around the leg and thigh.
And then place splints on the thigh, over the fractured area, and place one splint over the bone of the leg.
And then fill the empty spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the fracture is immobilized.
And then begin with a strong bandage in the middle over the fracture area with three or four wraps, and the farther you move away from the fracture site with the bandage, the bandage should become less strong, lighter, and softer.
And then extend the two ends of the splint downwards until they reach the ankle, and tighten both ends of the splints on the other side so that the bandage does not shift from its position.
And then leave the bandage on it, so that no swelling, abscess, inflammation or similar ailments occur on the limb; and if any of these occur, then remove it with care and correct whatever happened immediately, as we have said many times.
But if there is a bone fragment (piece of bone) that is sticking out, then you must try to push it back in as much as possible; and if not, cover it and leave it there, and treat it with whatever is appropriate to its prior condition until it is healed.
And sometimes this thigh fracture is tightened with splints, as we have said in the case of the arm.
However, in restoring it in this way, the patient does not experience limping; and if it is restored alone, or with the other leg applied to it, then it is necessary that the one that has always limped, limps again.
And know that the thigh is bandaged for 40 days or a little more or a little less, and all of this is according to the diversity of the constitutions and other dispositions.
Chapter 15.
Of the restoration of a fractured kneecap (or patella).
Know that a fracture of the kneecap often involves, but frequently causes, rubbing.
But if it is a fracture, then it is only a fissure or hole in its parts, and this is with or without a wound, and concerning this everything has been felt.
And the restoration of it is such that what is broken in its parts is brought together with splints until it is joined and united as much as possible by adjustment, ease, and construction.
Then apply a plaster and place it over that round area, if needed; and bind it tightly with a suitable bandage.
Then consider all the treatments we have described in other fractures, just as for an abscess and similar conditions, so that any accident is opposed with what is appropriate for it until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured leg.
Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is thick, and is called the thigh bone; and the other is slender, and is called the fibula.
And the treatment for any of the fracture types that occur to the two bones of the arm is the same as the restoration of the arm, and the procedure for it is one and the same.
And if both bones are broken together, the leg is displaced in all directions.
And if the more slender bone is broken, the leg is displaced forward.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you find it below, and it's from those causes that are not hidden from you.
And then administer extension, reduction, and ligation of the splints, according to that same procedure.
However, if the fracture of the leg is extensive, having many lacerations, the extension should be less and gentler, and alleviate it with your skill.
And if the leg requires an operation on the arm, and once you have fitted the splints and completed your entire operation, then you will take pieces of wood – particularly those placed beneath the structures that have been placed on the bed, and made easily from palm branches.  Choose those of small thickness, and avoid any that are large, and make their lengths correspond to the length of the leg, from the knee down to the lowest point.
And then wrap each piece of cloth in two layers, according to its length, and place one over one side of the leg and the other over the other side, extending from the knee to the lowest part of the foot.
Then tie the two splints in three places – at both ends and in the middle.  With this binding, the leg is prevented from bending to either the right or left side, and remains in a good position.
And now a small wooden brace, corresponding to the length of the leg, is placed on it so that the leg retains this position.
And this is especially necessary to do in cases of fracture, and when the limb is properly set.
And from now on, examine the leg daily, and closely monitor it, observing for any abscess, inflammation or other similar problems.  If any such issue arises, treat it accordingly until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the heel bone and the bones of the foot and toes.
A fracture of the heel bone does not occur frequently, however fractures of the foot bones occur sometimes; and fractures of the toes are rare, and the only issue that occurs in the toes is friction during movement.
And if the bones of the foot sustain a fracture, and the bones are sometimes displaced from their alignment, then the patient must place their foot on the ground in a manner similar to walking.
And then place one foot on that which is raised by those bones, and then press and squeeze them until they return to their proper places.
And then apply a plaster and bandage on top, and place a small board with two padded ends under the sole of the foot.
And then firmly bind that with a descending bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other materials as needed.
And after three or four days have passed, then you loosen the bandage, for you will find the bones either squeezed together, or broken, or dislocated, and the procedure in these cases is as you know.
But if any fingers are broken, then restore them, and fix them in the same way as I have explained to you in the restoration of hand fingers. And then place a splint along the length of the broken finger, and a little wider than the finger; and then place the aforementioned board under the foot, and bind it with a descending bandage.
But if what is broken of the bones is two, three, or more, then you place a splint on each finger of its appropriate size, wrapped in linen cloth, and bind the board to the lower part of the foot, and place one end of the board above the patient's abdomen, so that it holds the foot firmly.
And it is important for you not to forget that you should consider all the causes that have been discussed concerning other fractures and accidents; and be prepared for any accident with what is necessary.

Of the fracture of the thigh bone, the hip bone, and the penis of the male.
When the thigh bone of a woman is fractured, then make a splint from a smoothed board, and then slightly incline it towards the back, and keep it held in place behind.
Then the midwife fills the thigh with wool, and it should be placed in the thigh just as the leg is; and then the woman should be calmed, and gradually raise their back, for everything is held back until the fractured thigh bone returns to its proper alignment.
Then place pillows under their back, and when they want to urinate, the wool comes out easily, and they urinate. Then return it according to the manner in which you put it in at the beginning, and then put it back on its original pillow.
And do this for seven days or thereabouts, for that is when it is restored.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and insert a reed cannula into the wound; and insert the entire bladder into the thigh, and then blow into the cannula with force until the bladder is inflated inside the thigh, for the fracture will return.
And then fill it with wool and leave it for a few days as we have recounted, until it is healed.
And when the hip bone of a man or woman is broken, then administer in its restoration and setting what we have recounted for the hip bone.
And that which is right is not hidden in these close and minor fractures, especially for him who has some study and use and understanding of this book of mine; for that fracture signifies to you in the most direct ways the right procedure in restoring and binding it, therefore understand well.
However, if a man's penis is broken, take a bird's wing, and place it on the penis; then put a bandage of cloth over it, wrap it, and leave it for three days or so, and it will be healed.
Chapter 19.
Of the restoration of fractures of bones when affected by plague.
Convenient it is for one who has sustained a fracture with plague, especially if the bone is large, such as the bone of the thigh or the arm, or similar, that you should immediately bleed and scarify that part if the conditions for bloodletting or scarification, as we mentioned above, apply.
And if the plague flows blood, then it is necessary to apply a cautery to the retention of it, so that you powder it with crushed stone, if no other cause is present.
And then begin restoring the fracture on that same day, and do not delay this if an abscess is not developing.
However, if a severe abscess develops, then you should leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided, and do not approach it on the third and fourth days of all, for you will cause bad accidents.
However, if the broken bone is prominent above the skin, then it is necessary to gently reduce it and hold it in place with your hands, using little force.
However, if force isn't suitable to reduce it with your hands, then you reduce it with your hands using this instrument; and this instrument is made of iron, its length is seven or eight digits, and its width is according to the size of the injury; and for this reason, it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them, depending on the quantity needed for the treatment of any type of fracture.
And it should be round, and have little thickness so that it is not bent by the pressure on it during the operation.
And it should have a sharp tip, with edges at its ends;  and the top of it should be thick and taper from the middle towards the ends.
And this is its form:
And it is called in Greek "labre volentz atelarem,"  which is a small spatula.
Therefore, it is necessary that the sharp end be placed elevated over the prominent bone end.
And you push it (the instrument) in one go until the bone returns, and it is bound with some bandage.
And therefore, strive to bind the fractured ends together; and if the broken bone end is thin and does not accept the instrument favorably, then it is necessary for you to cut the end of that bone until the instrument has the ability to do so.
But if you cannot reduce the bone completely with what we have described, then cut it with whatever surgical instruments we have mentioned; or saw it with a saw in whatever manner is possible for you.
And then remove whatever roughness and small splinters remain in the bone.
And when the bone is reduced, and after the reduction the patient experiences intense pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and therefore do what you deem best to greatly help the patient.
When your bone restoration is complete, then soak a cloth in black astringent wine, and specifically if it is summer, and do not place a plaster or other oily substance on the wound, so that it does not cause swelling and corruption.
And after administering the styptics at the time of your bone restoration, leave the wound uncovered, so that you cut the opening with scissors and apply dressings according to the size of the wound.
And be very careful not to constrict the wound with the fracture, for many times foolish doctors have done this, and caused death or a corrosive or festering illness in their patients, that is, gangrene. And if your constriction is slight, soft, different from the constriction of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or is a bad wound, and you fear any of the harmful accidents we have mentioned, and you find pain in the area, then you should not apply styptics, but instead make a dressing of hard cloths in place of styptics and bind it tightly.
And when, after a day or two, the wound begins to suppurate, then you remove the cloth you had placed over it with wine, and then apply some ointments, such as those we customarily use to treat wounds, like tetrafarmacon ointment and similar ones.
And you should loosen the bandage and examine the wound each day morning and evening until it is healed and closed, and the limb should be prepared in such a way that the pus can drain from it to the lower parts with ease.
If the wound passes many days and is not healed or the pus has not been drained from it, then know that there are difficulties here that require you to investigate the wound with a probe. And of those difficulties, those that are separable, remove and extract them; those that are not separable and cause pain and swelling in the limb, force you to cut them open as you are able.
And if the wound is afflicted with a swelling or inflammation, or another type of corruption and putrefaction, then you should apply to it one of those remedies that are appropriate for its cure, as described in the preceding chapter.
And in this, where my instruction ends and your skill begins: when a large bone is broken, support the limb in the same way as the thighbone and the supporting parts, and similar to those of large limbs, and do not attempt to pull or remove it, for often death results from this; leave it until it sets, for it will often heal by itself in about 20 or 30 days; and then treat the wound if you see fit, and if it does not heal, leave it alone.
Chapter 20.
Of the treatment of inflammation that occurs in the vicinity of any fracture.
Often this inflammation occurs in the area surrounding the healing of a fracture, especially if it is near a joint, and disfigures the shape of the limb; and it easily prevents the limb from its natural function.
Then consider if the inflammation is recent, and apply medicines that have a styptic effect, such as alum, vinegar, myrrh, ceruss, and similar things; you can use some or all of them and mix them with a styptic wine, or egg white, or sour wine, and apply it to the inflammation on a bandage, and tightly bind it around.
And leave it tightly bound for several days; and then loosen it and reapply another, until the inflammation is gone; or apply a lead lamina to it gently, for lead has the property of relieving any swelling in the limbs.
However, if the inflammation has become hard and compacted, and its removal is necessary, then carefully cut it out in its most prominent area, and remove excess tissue and the inflamed part, or use some rasps until it is gone; and treat the area until it heals.
Chapter 21.
Of the restoration of a fracture when it is restored and afterwards the limb remains delicate and frail, not according to its natural strength.
When a fractured bone is repaired, and afterwards the limb remains weak and frail, this is caused by several things:  one is an excessive loosening of the ligaments and the binding done incorrectly; or by excessive tightening of the ligaments, preventing the nourishment from reaching the limb; or by excessive poulticing; or by unnecessary movement at the wrong time; or by a lack of blood in the patient's body and their weakness.
And the treatment for this is to feed the patient and make their body soft until the blood is replenished; and administer baths; and bring joy and happiness to them.
And then apply a poultice to the limb, so that the poultice draws more nourishment to it, or continue applying warm water compresses, until nourishment flows and returns to its natural form.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of broken bones when they are improperly rejoined and the operation is not performed correctly.
When, after the limb has been rejoined, there is still a crookedness and prominence in the broken bone and callus formation, and this is causing a deformed limb, but nonetheless the limb is not prevented from its natural operation, then you should not believe the claim of anyone who says the limb is newly broken.
But already there have been many foolish physicians and surgeons who have done this in our land; and this procedure is highly reprehensible, leading to great fear of a fatal outcome.
However, if the lameness and callus are recent, then they should be bathed in lukewarm water in which softening herbs are steeped, such as elder leaves and roots, and melilot, and similar ones; and a softening poultice should be made, such as a well-made diachylon; or a mucilage should be taken from elder root and mixed with the yolk of an egg or with cedar oil, and the limb should be poulticed with this; or fatty figs should be crushed with pigeon dung, and similar medicaments are known as "consolidants".
And sometimes it is dissolved by persistent gentle rubbing with moist hands, and movement of the limb should be administered in every direction at all times.
But if the crookedness has progressed and become firm, turned to stone, and needs to be treated with iron, then the pus must be drained, and the continuity of the bone must be dissolved, and what is superfluous of the callus from the bone must be cut away with sharp instruments, and care must be taken with diligence and study.
Chapter 23.
Of discourse on dislocation.
Dislocation is the shifting of any joint from its proper place, which prevents movement, and it distorts the shape of the limb, causing great pain and harm to the patient.
Therefore, when an accident causes a dislocation, it is essential to attempt reduction immediately, and do not delay the reduction, for if it is delayed, the joint becomes inflamed and very stiff, making the reduction of the dislocation difficult.
And therefore, it should not be moved or stretched during the inflammation, for it often causes spasms and persistent pain.
But when this occurs, you should proceed with the bloodletting of the patient, and then let it rest until the inflammation subsides; then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil, and the reduction should be attempted with ease.
And every limb should be treated in this way, so that the afflicted part returns to its proper position.
And I have already ordered the chapters on dislocation according to what precedes in fractures; from the most superior part of the body down to the lowermost part.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the treatment of dislocations of the lower jaw.
So the two jaws are dislocated, if not quickly; and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are displaced slightly from their places and somewhat softened; or they are completely and thoroughly dislocated, until they are softened at the joint, causing the patient to drool and unable to keep the mouth shut, and the patient's tongue is wrapped around its own mouth.
However, when the dislocation is slight, then in most cases it returns on its own with little effort.
However, if the dislocation is complete and thorough, then a gentle reduction must be administered promptly, and it should not be delayed at all.
And it is necessary that the attendant hold the patient's head, and the doctor insert the fingertip of one hand into the site of the jaw dislocation inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or that he insert both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of his hand should be outside for support; and he should instruct the patient to stop moving their jaws and force them to go in opposite directions; and the doctor pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, then apply steam with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both is easy and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And therefore, when they return and are aligned, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place over them cloths soaked in cerot (a mixture of wax and oil); and it should then be bound with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on their back, and their head be supported between two pillows so that it does not tilt to either the right or the left; and do not force them to chew anything; until the pain subsides and their jaws are healed, then let them eat whatever they wish.
And this should be administered easily, and do not exert yourself in opening the mouth for eating, drinking, and breathing, until the jaw is healed and sound.
And if the reduction of the two jaws, when dislocated at any time and not returned to their place, then many times fevers and persistent sweating occur, and the patient's stomach is very easily upset, and there is a lot of vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is perilous; and often the one who experiences this dies within a few days.
Chapter 25.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the extremity of the muscle.
The collarbone is not dislocated from the inside by its connection with the foot; and sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and this is evident through the feeling.
And the restoration is that the patient lies on their back and extends their arms. And then press the area with your palm with a strong pressure, for it will return.
And then place a plaster and powders over that area and press it down.
However, the extremity that is connected to the elbow and continues with it is not dislocated on any given day; therefore, it must be reduced and mended according to what we have said and according to what is in your care.
And then apply a plaster, and powders, and a splint, and command the patient to adhere to quietness and rest until healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle.
Know that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, of which one is that it is dislocated from the upper part to the lower part.
And the second is that it is dislocated to the upper part of the muscle, and this is done more slowly; and it is not dislocated to the rear by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated to the front by the nerves.
And most often it is dislocated and comes out from the lower parts toward the upper part, and more often in those with little flesh it is easily dislocated; but in those with a lot of flesh, it is forced out with difficulty.
And often, men are struck or injured by accident, and their muscle is inflamed with a hot abscess, and it is considered to be dislocated because of this.
Therefore, you should ensure that you have full control of it, and then proceed with its treatment.
And the dislocation is recognized when it is in the lower parts toward the top; so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle, for you find a clear difference between them; and you find a concavity at the head of the muscle and below the top, toward the point of contact of the head of the muscle, much like an egg, and the patient cannot bring their hand to their ear, nor move it freely in any way.
If it is dislocated towards the feet or upwards, and you then find a clear point of contact, and it is not hidden.
And a gentle reduction of this dislocation is possible when it is fresh and the patient is young.
And the reduction of it is that the physician raises the patient's hand towards the upper parts; and then places their fingers below the patient's armpit, and elevates the joint with strength back into its place, and the physician raises the patient's hand, and extends it upwards; and then places it down as it returns easily.
But if, despite what we have said, it does not return, and it has been a long time since the dislocation occurred, then the patient must be bathed in warm water and be given an application that softens and loosens it, as if it were crushed roots of marsh-mallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and should be administered.
And then the patient should be placed on their back, and a layer of wool that is neither too loose nor too tight should be placed beneath their armpit, and the physician places their heel on the sphere, and elevates the muscle's head with force, and pulls the patient's hand so it is not displaced downwards, and another physician holds the patient's head so it is not displaced downwards, for this will quickly return to its place.
And if you wish, reduce it in this way: have a man present who is taller than the patient, standing on the affected side, and he inserts his muscle under the patient's armpit and lifts the patient's armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, and another physician pulls the patient's hand from below their abdomen. But if the patient is light, then something else must be suspended to add weight, for this will cause the dislocation to return quickly.
And it is easily reduced in another way: a long wooden post is placed in the ground, its top rounded like a mortar pestle, neither thick nor thin, and placed under the patient.  Then, over the top of the post, heavy blankets are placed; the patient stands along the length of the post, and their hand is stretched downwards on the opposite side, and the patient's body is stretched on the opposite side with force, for the joint will return to its place quickly.
And if the reduction is difficult by all the methods we have described, then use this treatment: take a wooden post that is about two arms long and four fingers wide, and its thickness should be moderate at the armpit area in this manner:
And then, over the rounded top, heavy blankets should be tied so that the post does not injure the patient.
Then, a support should be placed under the patient's armpit, and the arm or hand should be stretched along the post, down to the lower parts, and the post should be tied to the support and arm and hand.
Then the arm should be placed on a ladder-like support according to its width, and the hand stretched downwards, and the other side of the body suspended on the other side, so that the joint enters quickly/immediately.
And when its entry is completed in whatever way possible for you, then you should place under the armpit a wool pad of suitable thickness; and then apply a prepared plaster of ground powder with incense and egg white over all the muscle, spread evenly over it, and then bind tightly under the armpit with a suitable bandage; the bandage should be wrapped around the plaster, and the patient's hands should be tied to their neck, and left undisturbed, and the hands should not be moved for seven days.
And it is necessary that the patient's food be light, until the limb is strengthened, for this is more conducive to its recovery.
And then the food should be increased to a moderate amount, after seven or five days, and movement should be encouraged; and thus if it is healed and not softened, then it is already cured.
But if the joint is dislocated many times due to humidity affecting it or another cause, then a cautery with three openings should be administered, as previously described in the chapter on cautery.
And if all this is done, and after seven days the bandage and the joint are not healed, and the plaster and the binding are removed several times, and it is not healed and stiff and cannot raise that arm up, then know that the nerves, which are at the head of the muscle, are now severed or stretched or softened, and know that the joint will never be placed back in its proper position.
For the dislocation of the foot and the nipple or the posterior parts, the reduction is done by pushing and pulling with the hands, until it returns to its place.
And another binding should be applied to that area, and it should heal until it is cured.
And if after healing there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use baths repeatedly until that heaviness is lessened and it returns to its original state.
Chapter 27.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated in all directions, and more so in the front to the back, and its dislocation is not hidden from you, for it is noticeable from pressure or from touch, according to what shape it has been dislocated. And when you adjust the dislocated elbow with your hand, this is clearly apparent to you, because the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm, nor touch the muscle.
And you should act quickly, and reduce the dislocation before it becomes a hot abscess, for if it becomes a hot abscess, the reduction is difficult, and the limb is not completely healed; and especially when it is in the back parts, for it is the worst of all other types of dislocation, and causes greater pain, and often leads to death.
And the restoration of it, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the patient's arm is extended with both hands, and their arm is extended, and the physician's hands are on the elbow and beneath it, and he presses the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the heel of his palm until it returns to its place.
However, if the dislocation is on the front parts, then it returns by bending the arm with their hand, until he strikes the elbow with the heel of his palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer forceful extension and strong traction.
And it is that two assistants extend the arm, and hold that extension so that it is not pulled back from the extension.
And then the arm should be rotated in all directions, since it is wrapped with a long folded cloth over their hand, or bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with their hand, anoint it with some oil so that these things aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease; and then push the joint with a forceful thrust until it returns.
And after the reduction, it is necessary to place it on a compress in which there is styptic and binding with egg white, and to be bandaged tightly downwards, and the arm be suspended from the neck, and to be left for some days.
And then it should be loosened; and therefore, if the joint is formed in its place, then you loosen the bandage from it and leave it.
And if you see the joint is not well tightened, then you repeat the poultice and the bandage, and leave it for some days until it is tightened; and then loosen it.
But if there is a worsening of the situation after the joint reduction, and the condition is moving, then apply moistening through bathing and gentle friction and compression, until it is relieved; or place on the joint soothing material, that is, something of a fatty nature; and then bandage it, and leave it bandaged on the limb day and night. And then remove that, and put the limb in a bath; and when it is soaked, then you rub the joint with gentle friction, and then repeat the soothing material, that is, something smooth and soft, once, and then a second time, and a third time. with the application of the bath, until it is healed.
And if you wish, place a heated, moist cow's hide over the affected area and press firmly on it; and do this several times, for this is moist and will restore it to its proper position.
Chapter 28.
Of the treatment of a dislocation of the shoulder, that is, of the joint between the arm and the hand.
A dislocation of the shoulder sometimes occurs, and the reduction of its dislocation is relatively easy; the opposite is true of other joints, but nonetheless speed is essential in its reduction when it is dislocated, before the area becomes inflamed or a harmful abscess develops.
And the reduction of the dislocation is that you place the patient's arm joint on a table, and the assistant extends the arm, and the physician places his hand, or his palm, over the area of the joint, and pushes until it returns to its proper place.
However, it is necessary to consider if the palm has already been turned towards the front of the hand, then the patient should place the back of their hand on a table during the extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is towards the back of the hand, then the position of the hand of the patient should be strategically on the table, so that the physician's hand can be applied to that area of the joint.
And so if it returns quickly, it is good; and if not, then firmly hold it while avoiding worsening the inflammation and leave it; and do not repeat this, for otherwise, it will not tolerate nor will you succeed in its reduction after several days have passed.
However, the joint remains according to its distortion; and if the patient reports no cause, but that the hand is weakened and cannot grasp anything, then know that the nerves are severed or damaged, and in that case, there is no remedy except to hold it with a cautery near the wound and firmly apply this, which may provide some benefit.
Therefore, once the injury has been reduced, apply the poultice that we have described, and let it be left and held for five days; and then it should be removed and left, and the patient's hand should be exercised.
But if the movement is hindered and some heaviness appears, then alleviate it with warm water and some friction several times, until it is relieved.
Chapter 29.
Of the treatment of finger dislocations.
Sometimes the fingers are dislocated in various directions.
And when any of those fingers is dislocated towards the palm side or the underside of it, then straighten the finger and push the dislocation away with your fingers, until it returns to its place.
And then support the head of the finger, and suspend it towards the side to which it was dislocated, and leave it like that for two days.
And then suspend it and extend it until it is properly aligned in its place.
And when it is night, bandage it according to that narrative, and do not cease to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bandage it at night; and do this for several days until it is straight.
And do the same if it is dislocated towards the underside of the hand, and bandage it to that side and do your first operation on it, until it is healed.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated in other parts of the body.
Chapter 30.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the spinal vertebrae.
When an accident causes a complete dislocation of any of the vertebrae in the back or neck, and the displaced vertebrae remain out of place, then there is no cure, for death awaits the patient.
A sign of this is that the patient's bowel movements are involuntary and uncontrolled; and often some of his limbs, or both legs, or both arms, or one of them, are paralyzed; or a vertebra has been displaced, for it is often displaced, and frequently the removal of these parts is made in four directions.
Therefore, this [dislocation] has already moved to the posterior parts and is called "gelbozitat" (likely a medical term referring to a specific type of spinal dislocation or injury).
However, its treatment is to consider whether the "gelbozitat" [spinal dislocation] occurred in childhood, because in that case there is no cure, nor is there a complete recovery.
But in cases of injury caused by a fall, a blow, or similar events, the Ancients described numerous treatment methods, the most beneficial of which I will briefly summarize, omitting the unnecessary details to keep my explanation concise and focused on the specific points of my instruction.  I've presented and organized this information using various tools with which I will demonstrate and clarify it.
And only those dislocations occurring in the back, specifically as described by me, can be treated.
And it is necessary that the patient be laid on their face, propped up against a wall, and cushioned underneath to prevent the foot from being injured.
And then a straight piece of wood should be placed, driven into the ground at the edge of the support, around the head.  Another piece of wood should be positioned similarly at the opposite end of the support to hold the patient's feet.
And one attendant should hold the first piece of wood, making sure it doesn't dig into the ground; and another attendant should hold the other piece in the same manner.
Then, wrap a bandage around the patient's head and under the temples firmly; and extend the bandage end to the wood which is near the head, securing it there.  Then, tighten another bandage around the patient's hips, thighs, and lower legs; and finally, secure all the bandages to the other piece of wood near the patient's feet.
And then each attendant should extend the bandage to the wood, ensuring the two pieces of wood and bandages remain in their positions, however, do not bind them so tightly as we have described.
And the physician places their palms on the spine with strength until it returns to its proper place, or places a table underneath it, and then adjusts their feet on the table until it returns to its proper place.
But if it does not return in this way, then take a board whose width or length is approximately three arms' lengths, and excavate a place in the wall, near the patient, into which the end of the board will fit. And then place half of the board over the spine, and the physician places their feet on the other end, and presses firmly until the spine is straightened and returns to its place.
And if you wish, turn the apparatus that is held by hand, and place two pieces of wood, each one arm's length long, in the ground behind the patient's head, and similarly two pieces of wood behind their feet; and the space between each piece of wood should be one palm's width.  A hole for the apparatus to fit should be made in each piece of wood, and each piece must be firmly planted in the ground so that it does not move.
And a round piece of wood, which the apparatus is on, should be rotated in the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
And at its [the round piece of wood's] end is a hole in which the apparatus is fitted, the length of which [the apparatus] is a palm plus whatever is rotated, and the other two pieces of wood have a similar hole.
And then tighten the bandages you have applied to the patient's feet in the hole near the head, and the bandages on their thighs in the apparatus near their feet.
And near each apparatus, let a helper turn the apparatus with their hand, while the physician applies the splint as we have described.
And then, once the splint has been applied and the area is secured, place a dry poultice with egg white, then linen; then place a thin wooden board, whose width is about three fingers and its length sufficient to cover the affected area of the joint, over the poultice, and on the splint's part.
Then bind it with the bandage we have mentioned, and let the patient consume fine nourishment until healed.
And if any lingering inflammation remains in the area after healing, then medicines that soften and soothe, administered with a long-term regimen as we have described, should be given; and a lead lamina should already have been administered to that area.
And sometimes inflammation occurs at the back of the spinal vertebrae, caused by that dislocation; and it is that bone that is now inflamed, so that no presumption should be made regarding it with this medicine, for it will easily cause death.
Chapter 31.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the muscle joint should only be dislocated, and that what happens to other joints with minor displacement and concavity does not happen to them.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inward, or outward, or forward, or backward.
And it is mostly dislocated inward, and less so forward or backward.
A sign of an inward dislocation is that when you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected leg, the affected leg is longer and the knee is more prominent than on the healthy side, and the patient cannot bend their affected foot towards their groin.  The area where the groin should be is inflamed and painful from a hot abscess, because the head of the thighbone has moved there.
The sign of a dislocation outward is that the symptoms are the opposite of this inward dislocation.
The sign of a forward dislocation is that the patient extends their leg to its full extent, but cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if pressed forward it cannot be moved further in that direction; and their urine is retained and their groin is inflamed, and they walk on the ball of their foot.
The sign of a backward dislocation is that the knee does not extend, nor can it be bent forward to reach the groin, and the affected leg is shorter than the other, and the groin is swollen, and the head of the thighbone is in that area.
But the reduction of these types of dislocation is that you must consider, then, if the dislocation is old and chronic, that it has already become accustomed to that position, then your reduction will only go so far, and then it is not a complete cure; and therefore, no premature assumptions should be made in this case.
However, in the case of a recent dislocation, one of the four types, you should carefully attempt to reposition the joint, extending it inward and outward, and moving it to the right and left, for it will likely return easily and require no further treatment.
However, if it does not return in this manner, then you must prepare a strong assistant and extend the patient's leg from the lower part, either by the patient's own hands, or with a bandage tied around the leg above the knee; and another assistant should hold the upper hand in such a way that their hands are below the patient's armpits; and then bind tightly with a bandage around the root of the thigh, and let a third assistant hold the end of the bandage.
And let the extension be either from the inside of the groin to the area of the pubic bone, or from the back to the area of the buttocks.
And let the extension be performed in all these ways until the patient is lifted off the ground with their own body weight and hangs suspended.
And this type of extension is a common procedure for all four [types of dislocation].
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then for every type it is necessary to proceed with the specific treatment.
In the proper reduction of a dislocation, when the dislocation is inward, the patient should be placed supine on their right side; then apply bandages over the root of the thigh, at the point between the head of the thigh and the area below the groin; and then extend the bandage over the groin area to the highest part of the pubic bone.
Then another strong assistant should take the patient's arms, and firmly grasp the thick part of the affected thigh and extend it outward with vigorous extension, for this will return it to its place.
And this type is easier to treat, with this limb being reduced more easily than other types.
But if you are excused and do not comply with this type of treatment, then it is necessary that the patient's two feet be bound together with strong, light bandages, on both ankles and both heels.
And the length of each bandage should be about four fingers long, and the affected leg should be extended more than the other by about two fingers.
Then the patient should be suspended upside down from the top of a post, in the house; and the distance from the ground should be about two arms' lengths.
Then order a strong young man to grasp the upper thigh, and let another young man hold the patient, and the other young man, pressing with strength on the thigh, will push, so that the joint returns to its place quickly.
However, in proper reduction, when there is a dislocation to the outside, the patient must lie on a cushion, as we have previously described in the chapter on sprains; and the bandage must be tightened on the affected leg and on the patient's feet.
And then two posts should be placed, one at the patient's feet, and another at the head; and then posts fitted together in the middle of the hill on which damp cloths are wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed because the posts are between the patient's thighs, to prevent pulling from the extension below.
And then each attendant should extend their portion, and the physician with their hand guides the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the forward parts, then the leg must be gently extended, and it is according to this same procedure on a hill; and the physician places the palm of their right hand on the affected limb, and then with the other hand, compresses that, and with that compression, positions that which is extended downwards to the front of the dislocation.
And if the dislocation is in the rear parts, then the patient should not be extended downwards, but raised above the ground; instead, they must be placed on a hard surface, just as is necessary for traction if their shoulder is dislocated outwards, according to what we have said about their lying on two pillows; and it is on their side and the ligaments are stretched, as we have said, not much.
And pressure should be applied with a bandage to the area where the joint is.
Therefore, once the reduction is completed as is necessary – and the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you, and it is that you extend the patient's two legs, and when you see those together and the patient grips their leg and expands it without excuse, then know that the limb has been returned as it should be – and then you bring the two thighs together and place a poultice and bind tightly so that the shoulder is not moved in any direction; and keep the patient at rest for three or four days.
And then remove the bandage and poultice, and compare one leg with the other.
Then, if you see them equal in appearance, then know that the dislocation is now fixed, and then let the patient go.
And if you see any cause of swelling, then you return and apply a plaster, and bind it according to your initial binding, and leave it for three days.
And then remove it, and have the patient walk slowly for some days, until they are stronger.
Chapter 32.
Of the treatment of a dislocated knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways, for it is dislocated outward, and inward, and downward (or behind), but not forward.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you tell the patient to straighten their leg at the hip; then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration in all these ways is that you have the patient lie down straight, so that they extend their leg as much as possible; place your leg against theirs, and put their foot between your feet; then, firmly hold the patient's knee with your palms, and place your fingers around their knee with strength. Another assistant should extend the leg until the knee returns to its place.
And a sign of its return/reduction is that their leg will straighten at the hip easily, without strenuous effort.
Then, bandage that area and bind the leg to the hip with a bandage for three or four days, then unbind them.
And do not allow the patient to walk for a few days, until they are healed and strengthened.
But if the reduction is beyond your ability, then administer strong traction with the ligaments, as previously described in the treatment of the hip.
Chapter 33.
Of the treatment of the dislocation of the heel.
The heel is sometimes displaced by a small movement, and sometimes it is dislocated according to its alignment, and the dislocation is either inward or outward.
And the sign of its dislocation is that the heel swells on the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment of the small displacement is a gentle return, and it is that it be extended easily with the hands and be held until it returns to its place.
However, in the treatment of it when it is dislocated according to its alignment, it is necessary to have the patient lie straight, and let a strong and able assistant stand behind the patient's heel in the middle of it.
Then, you, with your right hand, take the foot from the uppermost part, and with your left hand, take the lower part of the foot at the heel bone's location.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with the left twice, and then push with the left; and push the foot's heel with the right towards the leg without effort.
And do this twice, as we have counted.
And then push the foot's heel against the leg a third time, and you are at the heel.
Therefore, if it returns in one or two attempts using this method, and if the foot is now aligned properly, it is good; and if not, then repeat the procedure, for it [the foot/condition] returns [to its original state].
However, if you are prevented from reducing it with what we have recounted, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and firmly place a thick cloth on the ground, and position it between their thighs, and you have already draped a cloth over them so that they are not harmed.
And then, a servant of his holds his thighs, and another servant extends the leg with his hands or a bandage tied around the foot; and then each servant extends against the extension of their partner, and the cloth remains between the patient's thighs holding it, so that his body is not pulled to the lower parts against its extension.
And then the physician aligns the dislocation with his hands, and another servant holds the healthy thigh at the lower parts, for the dislocation returns with ease.
And so, when the dislocation returns and you are certain of the successful reduction, then apply a plaster and bind it firmly with bandages, and tie the foot to the leg with bandages.
And you should be mindful of the nerves that are behind the heel, so that the bandage on it is not too tight and harms it severely.
And then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage is softened, tighten it.
And then loosen it on the third or fourth day, and prohibit the patient from movement for 40 days. However, if he is forced to move before that period, there is no guarantee that the dislocation will not be dislodged and damaged, and therefore may not receive a cure.
And if a painful abscess occurs, then you must apply what was previously discussed in our narrative, in another location for treatment and application, until it is resolved.
Chapter 34.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the toes of the feet.
It is necessary that the dislocated part be gently pulled back without effort; and this is not difficult, rather it is easy.
However, if the dislocation is in one of the toes of the foot, then it is necessary to have the patient place their foot on a soft surface, like the ground or a table, and be positioned as if they were walking.
Then you stand, and place your foot on whatever part of the joints is protruding, and then press that with your foot with gentle force until it returns, and you see that it is now positioned and no longer appears to be protruding.
Then place a board underneath the sole of the foot that covers the entire foot, with two supports, and tightly secure it with proper and firm straps for three days; and then loosen these and allow rest from walking for several days, until the injury is healed and the restoration is assured.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocations that are caused by a bruise, or a fracture, or by both together.
When any of those causes occur, and you exert yourself in the treatment and restoration, often death ensues.
Therefore, it is not appropriate for anyone to presume to treat such a patient, but only those knowledgeable in the art, having long experience, merciful and compassionate, slow, neither rash nor presumptuous.  And let them use medicines in the beginning that only slightly reduce inflammation, and leave the patient to the divine judgment, except for one who has hope of healing from death, with an alleviation of the illness, and in whom some hope appears. Then strive as quickly as possible to perform the reduction at the onset of the cause, before it becomes a severe abscess.
And if the limb returns as desired, then administer a regimen that reduces inflammation and heals the bruise with whatever drying ointments are appropriate for it.
And if there is a dislocation with a fracture and the bones are separated, then you must set them, and do with them what we have said about simple ailments of those things that precede in those locations.
And, according to your ability, guard and avoid the dangers in the paths of fear, as my teachings precede you; for this is more beneficial to you from your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and better for your true body during your time. Thus ends the words of Albucasis, perfectly, for which may God be blessed. Amen.
