Of the fracture of the leg	On setting a fracture of the leg.	0.60247123
Know that the leg has two bones, one is rightfully called "mustel," and the other is called "foscile"; and fractures occur just as they do in the arm, and for this reason, the restoration is the same as that of the arm, and the work is all one.	The leg consists of two bones. One of them is thick and is called 'leg bone' (tibia). The other is slender and is called 'fire-stick' (fibula). Both of these are liable to the same kinds of fracture as occur in the two bones of the forearm, therefore the repair of them will be like that of the arm, and the operation is one and the same.	0.7308568
And if both bones are fractured together, the leg will twist in all directions.	If both bones are broken together, the leg will turn in all directions.	0.94067764
And if the thin bone is fractured, it twists forward.	If the fibula is broken there will be a forward deformity of the leg.	0.62663865
And if the thick bone is fractured, there is great pain, and it is easily seen; and it twists downward. Then administer extension, and set it evenly, and bind the splints evenly; but if the fracture is severe, and there are several pieces, then the extension should be less and more gentle; and adjust it according to your skill.	If the tibia be broken, and that low down, it will be obvious to you. Employ levelling and extension and binding on of splints similar to that (sc. of the arm). But it will be necessary, if the fracture of the leg be a serious one with much fragmentation, for the extension to be gentler and lighter; and you must employ the utmost gentleness in setting it.	0.80944145
