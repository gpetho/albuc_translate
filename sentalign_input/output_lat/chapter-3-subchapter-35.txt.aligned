When anything of this kind happens and you attempt treatment and restoration, death is a frequent sequel. Therefore such treatment should be undertaken only by a person that is skilled in the art, has long experience, is dexterous, sympathetic, cautious, and not reckless or over-bold. To begin with he should apply only remedies for the allaying of abscesses and then leave the patient to Divine providence, unless, of course, the injury is light enough to give some hope of his escaping death; in which case you should set out to reduce it at once before an abscess arise.	When such an injury occurs, and one attempts to treat and restore it, often death results. Thus, only those who are wise in the art, experienced, compassionate, patient, cautious, not reckless nor presumptuous, should undertake such a treatment. They should begin with medicines that reduce hot abscesses alone and leave the patient to divine judgment. Unless you see or hope for relief from suffering with mild symptoms and a sign of possible recovery. Attempt the reduction immediately at the onset, before a hot abscess forms.	0.9122962
