of the saphenous vein
This vein is generated in legs, in hot regions where neither grass nor trees grow, and in land where there is no moisture; and sometimes it arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens because of the putrefaction that comes under the skin, just as snakes and worms, generated between skin and flesh, occur within the body.
And the sign of the beginning of this vein is that a very large inflammation appears in the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to protrude, like the root of a plant.
When the head appears, you must wrap around it a piece of lead from one and a half to two ounces, and tie it, and leave the lead hanging from the leg, and every time a bit comes out during the cauterization, wrap it around the lead, and tie it; and if it is too long, cut off a part of it, and wrap up the rest, and do not cut it at its root, until it is all out; because if you cut it, it will go back into the flesh, and cause an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a serious illness; therefore it must be drawn out little by little until the end, and nothing remains in the body; and this vein is sometimes five palms long, or ten, and a man once came to me, from whom it came out ten palms long, and when you cut it, put a probe in the hole, and pierce it to the bottom, so that everything comes out; and the matter inside should be emptied, and apply medicines generating putrefaction to the place for a few days, then treat it like abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many branches, especially when it appears in the ankle joint, or in the foot, and many holes appear there, from which branches sprout; then treat it as we have said before.
