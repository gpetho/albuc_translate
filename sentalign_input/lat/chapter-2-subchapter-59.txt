On the nature of the irrigation of the bladder with the clepsydra.
Chapter 59.
When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus gathers there, and you wish to instill water and medicines into it, this should be done with an instrument called a clepsydra, and this is its design.
It is deaf, that is, closed.
And it has three openings, two on one side, and one on the other, as you see.
And the hollow chamber, where the plunger is, should be of a size that fits without excess, so that when it is drawn, moisture is sucked in; and when pushed, it expels to a distance, as with the clepsydra used to project naphtha, or "Greek fire," in battles of Mars.
So when you wish to project moisture into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the moisture, and draw up with the plunger; the moisture is drawn into the hollow chamber of the clepsydra.
Then insert its end into the penis, as we described with the syringe.
Then push the moisture with the plunger, so that this moisture reaches the bladder immediately, and the patient feels it.
The form of the slender irrigator by which the bladder is irrigated.
It should be made of silver or brass, with its head slightly raised like a small bowl, and beneath it, a hollow where a ligature may rest.
Then take a ramâ€™s bladder, and place in it the moisture you wish to use for irrigating the bladder.
Then tie it between the two hollows with a strong ligature using double thread, and warm that moisture slightly over a fire.
Then insert the end of the irrigator into the penis, and press your hand on the bladder containing the moisture with moderate pressure, until the patient feels that the moisture has now reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder at hand, then take a piece of parchment, make a circle from it, and perforate it all around its circumference.
Then insert a strong thread into those holes, as they go around.
Then join the circle, as the "alsofrat" is joined: after you place in it whatever you want from moistures, oils, and waters.
Then bind it to the instrument: and use it as you did with the bladder, by squeezing it with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
