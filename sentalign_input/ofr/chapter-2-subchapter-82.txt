of the trembling/shivering
Formication is a small false sensation around the body, and goes very deep; and sometimes the cold finds it, and it feels like a shivering death, and comes all over the body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the treatment is that you take a quill from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place this quill on the shivering, so that the circle surrounds the shivering completely; then turn your hand with the quill until you cut all around the shivering, and push it deep, and pull out the shivering by its roots.
And if you wish, make this with a quill of brass or iron according to this shape, and let it be thin underneath and cutting on top:
not pointed, so it can be held in the finger, and pressed.  And if you wish, cauterize the shivering, as described above in the chapter on cautery.
