Then bring it down upon the marked place with one downward stroke with gentle pressure, revolving the cautery; then quickly take your hand away while observing the place.

If a chronic pain occurs in the entire head, and the patient has been suffering from it for a long time, and has used clysters, and head medicines, and snuffs, and ointments, and bandages, especially if he has been cauterized with the single cautery that we have described, and none of that has benefited him, then consider the following.

[3] []
If the patient's head is naturally strong and not weak, and he feels intense cold, then cauterize him with another cautery a little above that one.

[4] []
Then cauterize him on each temple of his head until the thickness of the skin is gone and the amount of bone we described is exposed.

[5] []
And cauterize him in the back of his head, in the place known as "the axe," and lighten your hand in this one, and do not expose the bone, as the patient will experience severe pain from it, unlike the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head, and I will mention this cautery in its place.

[] [2]
 When the whole head is affected by chronic headache which has for long vexed the patient, and electuaries, laxatives, errhines, oils, and plasters have been applied; and particularly if he has undergone the single cauterization which we have described, all with no effect, then look well, and if his head is naturally strong of structure and is not weak, and if he feels a vehement frigidity, cauterize him over again a little above the first cautery; then cauterize him on each frontal prominence with one cautery so as to remove the thickness of the skin and expose as much of the bone as we have mentioned above; and burn him with one stroke on the hinder part of the head in the place known as the occiput; but in this cauterization be gentle and do not lay bare the bone; for thus the patient would have intense pain, different from that of other head cauterizations.

Either cauterization with a sharp, burning medication, or with iron.

If the elephantiasis be widespread over the patient and appears obvious, you should give him, as well as the cauterizations described for the head: one at the end of the nose; two over the cheek bones; two over the cervical vertebrae; six over the dorsal vertebrae; a great one over the coccyx by the last vertebra of the tail; another above that on the flat of the back; two over the hip joints, one on either hip; two on the knees, one on either knee; two over the shoulders; two on the elbows; and two on the upper part of the breast; and burn him once on each joint of his fingers and toes, and on each ankle and on each forearm.

If it comes out in this way, maneuver to insert its hands little by little. Then the woman should lie on her back and let her thighs hang down while lying on a bed and clasp her hands. Then squeeze her upper abdomen little by little.

Then remove the pillows from under her legs so that they are pointing downwards. If the fetus does not come out, take both her legs and move them vigorously, then squeeze above the hips little by little until the fetus rises up. Then the midwife inserts her hand and adjusts the fetus little by little.

 Presentation of the foetus by knees and hands : when it comes out after this manner you should seek to introduce the hands slowly; then let the woman lie back on her shoulders with her feet hanging down, reclining on a couch with her hands clasped together; then very gently put pressure upon the abdomen; then take away the pillows from under her feet until her lower parts are vertical ; and if the foetus does not come out then, take both her feet and shake them violently ; then press upon her costal margin until the foetus ascends ; then let the midwife insert her hand and put the foetus in the right position, very gently, and bid the woman bear down, until the infant is born.

As for the healing medications that are placed on the fistula externally, and how to place them on it: you should take one of the healing ointments appropriate for what you need, and spread it on a linen cloth. The cloth should be large enough to cover the entire fistula.

[15] []
Then cut with scissors, opposite the mouth of the fistula, a hole slightly larger than the mouth of the fistula.  Then spread some of the soft ointments on another cloth the size of the hole, and place it over it, positioned away from the mouth of the fistula so as to allow the easy exit of pus.  And do not remove the large cloth until afterwards.

 As for the consolidating medicaments that are applied externally to the sinus, and the manner of their application: you take one of the ointments suited to your purpose, and spread it on a piece of lint of sufficient size to cover the whole sinus; then with scissors cut a hole in the lint over the mouth of the sinus and a little wider than the sinus opening; then spread on another piece of lint a quantity of softening ointment proportionate to the opening and put the one on the other so that it stands away from the opening of the sinus, in order to ease the discharge of pus from it; and do not remove the larger dressing until after many days.

As to bandaging the bone when it is without wound or incision, it is thus: apply over the bone the plaster composed of mill-dust with egg-white and put over it soft tow; then put a pad in his axilla if necessary; then take a very long sling about a span broad; then place a doubled pad over the tow and plaster; then take a splint made of thin board; its width should be three fingers and its length the same; then wrap it in a rag; then wrap the rag together with the splint in that part of the sling that is over the site of the fracture; then tie the sling round the fracture and wind it round his neck and under his sound axilla and under his injured axilla and carry it several times in every direction as you judge best that the bandaging will hold the fracture firmly, for it will be apparent to you.
