of lethargy
For this disease, it is necessary to give the patient strong purgatives and pills that cleanse the brain; afterward, shave the patient's entire head, and place on the occiput the mustard plaster that is described in the treatise on plasters; and this is the manner of the cautery: do it as I have said.
If he is healed this way, it is good; and if not, make three cauteries from the middle of the head down to the neck, spaced a finger's width apart; and treat them as the others, and if you want to add more, and the patient is enduring, make one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two more on the two corners, and treat until healed; and use the cautery called "olivare", as I have said before.
