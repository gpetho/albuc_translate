Sometimes pain is in the back due to various causes, such as a fall, an impact, excessive evacuation, and similar reasons, due to the infusion of cold and humid matter.	Many different causes give pain in the back. Sometimes it happens from a fall or a blow, or from excessive evacuation or the like. It may also be due to an influx of humid matter.	0.82303834
And cauterization is only applicable in this specific type caused by the infusion of cold matter.	Cauterization is only to be employed in this last case, which arises from an influx of cold matter.	0.76878935
Therefore, it is necessary, after evacuating the patient with purging pills or similar, to make three lines on the painful back area according to its width, marking with ink five or more cauteries on each line, depending on the patient's tolerance and the strength of the cautery.	When the patient has been purged with foetid pills or the like, he should be cauterized in his back where the pain is, over the breadth of the flat of the back, after the place has been marked with ink, with three rows of cauterizations, five in each, or more, in proportion to what you see of the patient's endurance and strength.	0.780348
The cauterization should be done with a pointed cautery.	Use the punctate cautery.	0.5265142
And if you want, cauterize with three or four cauteries with a medium-sized cautery in this manner:	If you like, you may give him three or four cauterizations with the middle-sized claviform cautery.	0.7303605
