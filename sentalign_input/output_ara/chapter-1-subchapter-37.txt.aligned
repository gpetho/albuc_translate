If pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or thick wind, and the patient's sexual intercourse diminishes because of that, then it is appropriate to cauterize on the loins, on the kidneys themselves, a cautery on each kidney with the nail-shaped cautery iron that was mentioned earlier.  We sometimes cauterize a third time on the abdomen itself, resulting in three cauteries lined up, which is more effective.	When pain strikes the kidneys from chill or heavy vapour, and the patient's sexual vigour is impaired thereby, you should burn him right over the kidneys, once on each kidney, with the claviform cautery mentioned before. I have often burnt him with a third cauterization on the flat of the back, making three cauterizations in a line, which is most effective.	0.8363556
