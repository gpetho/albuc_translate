Often this illness comes to small children, and the sign of the onset is that they have shortness of breath when they rise, and fear;
and you find on the last spinal process of the back and on us the appearance that comes upon the other spinal processes.
When you see this and you want to treat it, cauterize it with the circular cautery according to this form.
So that the cautery affects each part of the spinal process equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spinal process with the pointed cautery two or three lines, and let the points be close to each other.
After, treat the area until it is healed according to what we have said, and be careful not to apply cautery to a curvature that is in a nerve spasm.
