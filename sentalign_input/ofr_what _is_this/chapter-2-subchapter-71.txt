Tentigo is an extra growth on the genitals, so much so that it is very ugly to see; and some women have it as big as a hand, and this is the treatment.
You must hold the excess of the tentigo in your hand or with hooks, and cut it carefully; and do not go too deep, so that bleeding does not occur, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed; and there is another growth that arises at the opening of the uterus and fills it, and sometimes appears suddenly, and is similar in appearance to a tail, and therefore the ancients called it "tailed sickness.
You must cut it, as we have said for tentigo, and treat it until it is healed.
