of fire
The head can rot either from an internal cause, or from an external cause;
and when you have treated this decay with medicinal remedies, and they are not effective, then it is necessary to cut off the limb up to the place where the decay reaches, so that the patient escapes death thereby, or by the greater misfortune, the loss of the limb;
and the sign is that the limb becomes black, so that it seems to be burnt by fire, and rots after the blackness, then this decay spreads from limb to limb, and takes over the whole body;
so hasten to cut it off, and if it is from the bite of some venomous beast, like a sea scorpion, viper, or similar, if the decay is at the tip of the finger, cut it off, and do not give it space to reach the hand.
And if it reaches the hand, cut it off at the joint, so that the decay does not reach the arm;
and if it reaches the arm, cut it off at the elbow;
and if it passes the elbow, it is fatal, and no treatment is effective except the extent of its power; (referring to the poison's power)
and do the same when the decay occurs in the foot:
if it reaches the first joint, cut it off after the next joint;
and if it reaches the foot, cut off the whole foot;
and if it rises into the leg, amputate at the knee joint;
and if it goes above the knee, there is no other option but to leave the patient to die;
and the way to cut or saw the limb is that you tie it above and below, and one assistant stretches one of the ties downwards, and another assistant the other tie upwards, and you separate the flesh which is between the two ties with a spatula's width, until the bone is exposed;
then cut or saw it, and place a linen cloth on each side, so that the saw does not touch the healthy part, and cause the patient further injury and a hot abscess.
And if bleeding occurs when you operate, cauterize the area quickly, or apply some astringent powders;
then return to your treatment until it is completed, then tie the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you what happened to a man in his foot:
he developed a blackness that looked like a burn, and this corrosion started in his toe, until it took over the whole foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he hurried to cut off the foot, and was healed;
and a long time later the corrosion returned in a finger of his hand, and he came to me, and I applied repelling medications after cleansing the body, and the corrosion could not be stopped;
and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I refused, because I had hope of driving back the matter;
and I also feared that if I cut off his hand, he would die, because the man's constitution was weak;
and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut off his hand, and was healed;
and I have only related this so that one may do the same, if there is need.
