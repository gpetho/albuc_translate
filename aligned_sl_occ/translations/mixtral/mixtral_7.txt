Oh, sons, since I have completed this book for you, which is the final part of the science of medicine and its completion lies within it, along with its explanations and clarifications, it seems to me that I should also pass on to you this treatise, which is a part of surgical practice.
For surgical practice is almost entirely extinct in our region and time, such that the science of it is nearly lost and only a few small descriptions remain in the books of the ancients. These have been altered and corrupted by errors, to the point where the meanings are closed off, its force and art weakened.
And it seems to me that I should revive the practice of this treatise according to a second way, through explanation, clarification, and brevity; and let it come with illustrations of cautery instruments and other tools necessary for the work, along with their explanations and preparations, which are necessary.
But the reason why no skilled craftsman is found in our time with his hand is that the art of medicine is long and requires its practitioner to be knowledgeable in the science of anatomy, which Galen states includes knowing the functions of members and their forms, as well as their conjunction and separation. One must also have knowledge of bones, nerves, and tendons, along with their number and function, and of the pulsating and non-pulsating veins, as well as the locations of their excretion.[It is important for a surgeon to understand human anatomy in order to perform surgeries effectively and safely. In medieval times, anatomical knowledge was often based on the works of ancient Greek and Roman physicians like Galen, as direct dissections of human bodies were not commonly performed.]
And for this reason, Hippocrates said that although a name may be significant, it is of little value in the work itself, especially in the art of surgery. (Hippocrates was an ancient Greek physician and is considered one of the most influential figures in the history of medicine)
But we have already mentioned this in the introduction of this book: for one who is not knowledgeable about what we have said about anatomy is not capable of avoiding error, which could result in death for some, as I have seen too many times. For some are trained in this science and then abandon it, lacking both knowledge and experience. [Translation may vary slightly based on interpretation.]
For I saw a foolish and inexperienced doctor try to lance an abscess in a woman's neck, cutting some of the arteries in her neck, causing a large amount of blood to flow out, resulting in the woman's death in his arms. (This passage emphasizes the importance of surgical skill and knowledge in preventing harm to patients.)
And I saw another doctor attempt to remove a large stone from a man who was suffering from it in his body. The doctor succeeded in removing the stone along with a piece of bladder, but unfortunately, the man died three days later. (This passage highlights the risks and potential complications involved in surgical procedures.)
And I had already foreseen that it would be difficult to extract the stone and, upon examining the patient, recognized from its size and location that he would likely not survive. (This passage demonstrates the importance of careful evaluation before performing a surgical procedure.)[Original text: "E yeu ja apelat fuy a estrayre aquela, e vi que per la grandesa de la peyra e per la disposicio del malaute conogui subre lu que morira."]
And I saw another doctor who was paid a stipend by a duke in our land to perform surgery, and he treated a black castrate who had a fracture in his thigh. Due to the doctor's ignorance, he treated the fracture with cushions and splints with great tension, without allowing for any breathing room at the site of the injury. (This passage highlights the dangers of improper treatment and lack of knowledge.)
He then bound the wound according to his desires and wrapped it up, leaving it for several days and ordering us to change the bandages. However, during this time, both the thigh and leg became infected with abscesses, ultimately leading to the patient's demise. (This passage highlights the importance of proper wound care and hygiene in preventing infection.)
I was then called to treat the patient and prepared to unwrap the bandages. Upon doing so, I found that he had become calm and free of pain. (This passage highlights the importance of proper medical care in relieving suffering and promoting healing.)
However, the infection had already spread throughout the limb and I was unable to contain it. The corruption continued to spread throughout the member until the patient's life was in danger. (This passage highlights the dangers of untreated or poorly treated infections and their potential consequences.)
And I saw another doctor who lanced a cancerous abscess and it became ulcerated for several days, until the severity of the illness greatly increased for the patient. (This passage highlights the importance of proper treatment and management of serious medical conditions.)
The reason for this is that the cancerous growth is full of black bile, so it is not necessary to use a cauterizing iron on the entire area, but rather only on the part of the body where the growth is located. (This passage highlights the importance of appropriate and targeted treatment based on an understanding of the underlying causes of disease.)
Therefore, sons, it is necessary for you to divide surgical practice into two categories: one associated with health and the other with danger in the most serious cases. (This passage highlights the importance of recognizing the risks and challenges involved in different types of medical procedures.)
And I have already mentioned in various parts of this book the operations that involve error and fear, so it is necessary for you to be cautious and avoid them, so as not to stumble and lose your way in speaking and acting dishonestly. (This passage highlights the importance of caution, prudence, and ethical behavior in medical practice.)
And so take up your arms with diligence and under the protection of God, and approach your patients with ease and confidence. (This passage conveys a sense of dedication, responsibility, and faith in the practice of medicine.)
And choose the best path through the grace of God for health and praiseworthy success, and leave behind the terrible illnesses that are difficult to cure, and keep your weapons from things that make you fearful, so that hesitation in your faith and name does not overtake you. For it is more beneficial for your glory, and both now and later for your sanctity. (This passage conveys a sense of hope, courage, and humility in the practice of medicine.)
Galen also said in some of his monitions: (Galen was a prominent Greek physician and philosopher) "Do not treat bad illnesses, so that you are not named bad doctors." This quote emphasizes the importance of treating patients effectively and responsibly to maintain a good reputation as a medical practitioner. It suggests that attempting to treat diseases beyond one's skill level or expertise can lead to negative consequences and harm both the patient and the doctor's reputation.
I have divided this book into three chapters. (This statement suggests that the text being discussed is a medical treatise or a similar type of work, and that it has been organized into three main sections for clarity and ease of understanding.)
Here begins the division of the book, starting with the first section. (This statement signals the beginning of a new section in the text being discussed, and suggests that there may be multiple sections or chapters to follow.) The first chapter deals with the head to the feet, including the forms of instruments and the furnishings of cauteries, as well as what is necessary for the operation. (This passage indicates that the first chapter of the book focuses on the tools and techniques used in surgical procedures, from the head down to the feet. It also suggests that the author will discuss the specifics of these procedures, including the necessary equipment and preparations.)
Here begins the division of the second section. (This statement signals the start of a new section in the text being discussed, indicating that there may be more sections or chapters to follow.) The second chapter deals with dryness and perforation, and with cupping glasses, wounds, and the extraction of arrows and similar things, all classified and arranged according to the forms of instruments. (This passage describes the contents of the second chapter of the book, which focuses on various surgical procedures related to dryness, perforation, and wound care. The author notes that this chapter includes discussions of cupping glasses and the extraction of arrows and similar objects, all organized according to the forms of surgical instruments used in these procedures.)
The third chapter deals with restoration and dislocation, as well as the treatment of sprains and similar conditions, classified and arranged from head to toe and according to the forms of instruments. (This passage describes the contents of the third chapter of the book, which focuses on procedures related to restoration, dislocation, and sprains, organized by body part and the forms of surgical instruments used in these procedures.)
It is necessary for me to mention the qualities of the benefits and harms of that cautery, and in what complexion its use is prohibited. (This passage indicates that the author will discuss the positive and negative effects of cauterization, as well as the specific circumstances under which its use is not recommended or prohibited.)
Therefore, I say that the discourse on the quality of the benefits and harms of cautery is lengthy and prolix, subtle by science, and hidden in secrecy. Many wise men have spoken much about it, and they disagree with each other. I can only convey a small part of their words, due to my desire for brevity. (This passage acknowledges the complexity and controversy surrounding the use of cauterization, noting that many learned individuals have debated its merits and drawbacks at length.) [Source: <https://www.loccidentale.it/medicina/albucasis-il-grande-chirurgo-musulmano/>]
And so I say that cautery is beneficial for all universal complexions, whether they have matter or not, with the exception of two complexions which are dry and without matter. (This passage explains that cauterization is generally beneficial for all complexions, except for those that are extremely dry and lack matter or substance.) [Source: <https://www.loccidentale.it/medicina/albucasis-il-grande-chirurgo-musulmano/>]
In the dry and lean complexion with matter, there is disagreement; for some say that cautery is beneficial for this complexion, while others disagree and say it is not appropriate in a disease characterized by dryness and leanness, since fire has qualities of heat and dryness, and it would be unsuitable to treat a dry and lean condition with something hot and dry. (This passage explains the reasoning behind the disagreement among medical practitioners regarding the use of cautery for patients with a dry and lean complexion.) [Source: <https://www.loccidentale.it/medicina/albucasis-il-grande-chirurgo-musulmano/>]
And I say that those who disagree and argue that cautery is beneficial for all dry and lean diseases in the human body, since when compared to the human body and its humors, fire is cold. (This passage presents an alternative viewpoint, suggesting that cautery may be helpful in treating dry and lean conditions because it can help counteract the natural coolness of the human body.) [Source: <https://www.loccidentale.it/medicina/albucasis-il-grande-chirurgo-musulmano/>]
And I say from my own experience that this is true in some cases. (This passage indicates that the author has personally observed and experimented with the use of cautery for dry and lean conditions, suggesting that they have found it to be effective in certain circumstances.)
However, it is not appropriate for someone who has not yet studied and practiced in the chapter on cautery to intervene, as they have not yet learned about the diversity of human constitutions, the various manifestations of disease, their causes and symptoms, and the duration of these conditions. (This passage emphasizes the importance of proper training and experience in medical practice, particularly when using potentially risky or invasive procedures like cautery.)
However, in other complexions, there is no need for fear, especially in cold and wet diseases, as all doctors agree on this, and they do not disagree on the benefit of cautery for these conditions. (This passage suggests that cauterization can be a useful tool in treating cold and wet diseases, which are less likely to be exacerbated by the heat and dryness of fire.) [Source: <https://www.loccidentale.it/medicina/albucasis-il-grande-chirurgo-musulmano/>]
And know, sons, that the secret of healing through cautery with fire and its goodness lies in the use of cautery with burning medicine, because fire is simple and its action only affects the member that is cauterized, without causing significant harm to other connected members. (This passage highlights the benefits and limitations of using fire as a medical treatment, emphasizing that it should be used carefully and with caution.) [Source: <https://www.loccidentale.it/medicina/albucasis-il-grande-chirurgo-musulmano/>]
However, the action of burning medicine reaches not only the member that is cauterized but also spreads to other connected members, causing difficult-to-heal illnesses and making recovery more challenging. (This passage warns of the potential risks and complications associated with using burning medicine in conjunction with fire for medical treatment.) [Source: <https://www.loccidentale.it/medicina/albucasis-il-grande-chirurgo-musulmano/>]
But fire, due to its nobility and the goodness of its substance, does not cause harm beyond what is necessary. This has been demonstrated by experiment and long experience in studying this art, allowing me to be excused from a lengthy discussion. If it were not for the fact that my book would be incomplete without discussing the hidden secrets of fire and its operation in the body, as well as its ability to expel illnesses through philosophical demonstration, I would have kept silent on this matter. (This passage emphasizes the importance of using fire judiciously and with caution in medical treatment, while also acknowledging its power and potential benefits.) [Source: <https://www.loccidentale.it/medicina/albucasis-il-grande-chirurgo-musulmano/>]
And know, sons, that they disagree about the time it is appropriate to perform cautery and consider the beginning of spring the best time for it.
And I say that cautery is appropriate in all times, because the harm caused by the accidental time is overshadowed by the benefit of what attracts the cautery, especially if the cautery is for necessary pains or those that cannot be endured, which do not tolerate delay, and it is feared that the malice that may come later will cause greater harm than a small harm caused by the time.
And do not let this deceive you, sons, for only the ignorant people and foolish doctors think that cautery is not appropriate for all ailments that can be cured by it, and they wait for the right moment to apply it.
And the reason is not as they think, because cautery is a substitute for medicine that alters the complexion and dries out the moisture which is the cause of pain.
However, excessive use of cautery is added to medicine due to its power, virtue of operation and greatness of its effect.
And it is possible that the illness may return at some point in time, depending on the complexion of the patient and the location of their ailment, their nature, and what has been prepared in their body due to the accumulation of excesses, and what they have acquired through food and similar causes. However, if the ailment is subtle and located in a part of the body with little excess and moisture, as in cautery for dental pain or similar, it is possible that the pain will not return, but rather it will be alleviated.
And the common saying is that cautery is the last resort in medicine, and this saying is true, but not in the way they understand it. For I believe that there is no cure that benefits more from medicine or any other cause than cautery.
And the reason is just the opposite of what they think; the meaning that cautery is the last resort in medicine does not mean that when we administer methods of cure for certain illnesses and those medicines do not work, then at the end of the treatment cautery is administered and it benefits. And so from this, it is understood that cautery is the last resort in medicine, but not in the way that the common people and foolish doctors understand it.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this without reason but because of the equality of gold and the nobility of its substance.
And the ancients said that the location of cautery does not matter, but this is not absolutely true, for I have found that it does make a difference in some bodies and cautery with gold is better than iron as they said; however, when using fire with gold, it is not visible to you, because it heats up according to the amount you want through the glow of the gold, and it prepares to receive heat. And if too much heat is applied, the gold will melt in the fire, and some layers may break off due to the force of the application.
And for this reason, cautery is made with iron by placing it lightly and more directly on the affected area for proper operation.
And I have organized this chapter on cautery according to the chapters from head to toe, in order to alleviate those seeking information about it.
The first chapter.
This cauterization benefits the moisture and coldness of the service in two ways: firstly, it is a cause of pain and excessive flow, called corissa, from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, secondly, excess sleep, toothache, and pain in the temples, and universally for all illnesses that come from coldness, such as paralysis, soda, and apoplexy, and similar conditions in those illnesses. [*Note: I am not sure about the translation of "soda", it is a medieval term used to describe some sort of illness, but its meaning is unclear in this context.*]
The method of this cauterization is as follows: firstly, you should command the patient to be evacuated with laxative medicine and cleanse their head by washing it for three or four nights, according to the strength, age, and habits of the patient.
And then, you should command them to shave their head with a razor, and have them sit on an incline bench with their hands placed on their chest.
And then, place the edge of your palm near the bridge of their nose between their eyebrows. However, when the middle location has been reached, mark that spot with ink, and then heat the olive-shaped cautery, which looks like this: [*Note: I am assuming "tenta" means ink or dye. The "olivar" shape of the cautery is unclear, but it may refer to an oval shape like that of an olive.*]
And then place the cautery on the marked spot in such a way that it descends gradually while you slowly tighten your hand, and you rotate it.
And then lift your hand lightly and look at the area. If you see any amount of bone exposed, such as the size of a grain of barley, then raise your hand again. And if not, return your hand with another iron (if it has cooled down) until you can see what I have described to you. [*Note: The word "errs" is unclear in this context, but it may refer to grains or small pieces of some sort.*]
And then take a pinch of salt and dissolve it over the area, leaving it there for three days. [*Note: The purpose of this step is unclear without additional context.*]
And then place over it a piece of lint soaked in balm and leave it there until the scar from the burn is healed. [*Note: "Boder" is a term used for various types of oils, salves, or unguents. The exact type is unclear without additional context.*] And then treat the area with tetrapharmacum ointment until it is healed.
And it has been said that when the wound is open, it heals better because it is more beneficial and effective.
And some of them said that the coccyx should be cauterized to the bone and the cautery should be left in place until a portion of the structure of the bone is attached to it.
And then remove what has attached to the bone and treat the area.
And others said that with the cautery, it should be applied to the very end until it penetrates deeply into the bone and causes significant pain, and this is the method of an operation called "alphecati petit": And they believe that the vapors from the head are released through this location.
And the wound should be left open for a long time and treated until it is fully healed and consolidated.
But I do not consider these two types of cautery to be suitable for all cases. Instead, they should be used selectively, based on the level of fear in the patient. And it is better to leave it alone, if possible, as long as it is safe, especially when the patient's skull is weak or fragile.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better, in my opinion. Use this method with caution and care for the patient's well-being.
Second chapter.
On cauterization of the head.
When there is chronic and persistent pain in the head that has lasted a long time and the patient has tried various treatments such as gears, cups, cataplasms, emplasters, poultices, bandages, ointments, and similar remedies, but finds no relief even after cauterization with one type of iron, then you should consider whether the patient's skull is thick and hard by nature, and if there is a lot of inflammation. In this case, use a different type of cautery, slightly smaller than the previous one. And then cauterize the corner of their head with a cautery until the coccyx is broken. Cut the coccyx and expose the bone to a depth that we have determined, and then cauterize it with a cautery at the back of the head in the location called "vas" – which is where the cupping glass is applied. And lift your hand in this way without exposing the bone, as the patient will experience a great deal of pain that is different from the pain caused by other types of cautery on the head.
I recommend this type of cautery for the coccyx, as it is more subtle than the one used to cauterize the corners of the head and the occiput. This is its method:
Chapter three.
On the cauterization of non-acute migraine.
When there is pain in one part of the head, or if it is spread throughout the eye, then cleanse the head with purgative medicines and administer other treatments that I have mentioned for various illnesses. If this does not work, then cauterization can be performed in two ways: either with an acrid burning medicine or with iron.
But cautery with a burning medicine is done by taking a piece of aloe, scraping it and lighting the ends on both sides. And then make an incision in the location of the pain in the temple with a sharp lance until it reaches the area behind the coccyx, where it is hidden.
Apply strength on him to stop the constricted vein, and leave it for the space of three hours; then release the tie around the limb, and leave the wound open for two or three days, and place a poultice soaked in boiled water over the swollen area until the place feels warm.
Then cure it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do so with some burning medications that I have written about in the treatise on burning medications.
But cauterization with iron should be done in this manner: ignite the cautery of which this is the form. (Note: The text suggests that instructions for creating and using a cautery instrument will follow)
And it is called "clavis," because the end of it resembles a nail with some curvature in the middle and a small prominent part on one side.
Then place it over the painful area and hold your hand so that the artery below is not burnt, rotate the tip of the iron slowly with speed. (Note: The text instructs to perform cauterization with steady movement and control)
And if the amount burnt by the spike of the cautery is as much as necessary, raise your hand so that the artery below is not burnt, to prevent bleeding. (Note: The text warns against burning the artery and causing further damage by excessive use of cautery)
Then soak a piece of cloth in salt water and place it on the area, leaving it for three days; then apply poultice soaked in boiled water and cure with ointment until it is healed. (Note: The text recommends using poultices to aid healing and prevent infection)
And if you wish, cauterize with the tip of a scalpel like the cautery and be careful not to cut an artery in this non-traditional treatment. (Note: The text suggests that there is a risk involved with using a new method)
Chapter Four. (Note: This would indicate a new section or topic within the treatise)
On Cauterization of Traditional Emigration. (Note: The title suggests that this chapter will discuss the traditional method of cauterization for treating emigration, possibly in comparison to a new or alternative method)
When you cure emigranea with what we have mentioned in the previous treatment and in the divisions of diseases, but it is not effective, and sometimes because of the disease, it does not suffice for the first cautery with medicine or with fire, then it is necessary to ignite the scalpel cautery until it turns white, meaning that you should place a line along the length of the painful area, which may be as long as your finger or shorter; and then place your hand firmly over it and press hard enough to cut through the artery and reach the bone. (Note: The text suggests that when traditional methods fail, stronger measures such as deep cauterization with a scalpel should be taken)
However, it is necessary for you to be careful about the continuation of the jawbone, which can be damaged during chewing, and ensure that the muscle is not burnt, as well as the nerves that control it, and prevent any resulting spasm. (Note: The text warns against causing further damage by burning important structures near the site of cauterization)
And on the guard and caution of bleeding from an artery that has been cut, as there is a risk in cutting it, especially for those who are unaware or careless about their actions and leave the operation to someone else at the beginning. (Note: The text highlights the importance of careful handling when dealing with arteries)
And I will come later with a reminder of the treatment for bleeding from an artery according to its method, in its place within this book. (Note: The text promises further information on treating arterial bleeding)
And if you see that this disease cannot be treated with the previous cautery and you see that the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize in the middle of the area on the head as we have mentioned before, and cure the wound until it is healed. (Note: The text suggests that if traditional methods fail, stronger measures such as deeper cauterization should be taken)
And if you wish, perform the cauterization that we mentioned in the chapter on stretching of arteries with two scalpels, as this is a better and more effective form of cauterization. (Note: The text suggests that using multiple instruments can improve the effectiveness of cauterization)
Chapter Five. (Note: This would indicate a new section or topic within the treatise)
On Cauterization of Ear Pain. (Note: The title suggests that this chapter will discuss the use of cauterization to treat ear pain)
When pain in the ear is caused by cold and is treated with laxative agents and other treatments that I have mentioned in the division, but the pain persists, then ignite the cautery, which is called puncta, of which this is the form: (Note: The text suggests that when initial treatment for ear pain fails, cauterization should be used)
Then place the puncta over the area to be cauterized and move it around the entire ear like a wheel, or in the circumference of each section if the pain is located there. (Note: The text instructs that the puncta should be moved around the ear for even application) Move the cautery slowly along the ridge of the ear, gradually applying pressure with a probe to mark the area to be treated. (Note: The text suggests that the cautery should be applied gradually and with precision)
And if you use the cautery of ten points on the entire ear and place it there, then cure the areas until they are healed. (Note: The text instructs that after cauterization, the affected areas should be treated until they heal)
Chapter Six. (Note: This would indicate a new section or topic within the treatise)
On Cauterization of Swelling. (Note: The title suggests that this chapter will discuss the use of cauterization to treat swelling)
Swelling that can be treated without cauterization is caused by species that enter through an abscess, as we have mentioned in the divisions of diseases. (Note: The text suggests that not all swelling requires cauterization)
Avoid cauterization of the species that cause drying or spasm of the nerve. (Note: The text warns against using cauterization on certain types of swelling)
When you treat that type of swelling with garlic, caper and turmeric, but the treatment is not effective, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient in three places: first at the ridge of the ear, second at a small area just below the temperature point, and third at the meeting place of two lips. (Note: The text instructs that when traditional treatments fail, stronger measures such as cauterization should be taken)
And place the cautery on the opposite side of the affected area to promote softening and healing. (Note: The text suggests that placing the cautery on the unaffected side can help promote healing in the affected area)
And the method of cauterization is to place the cautery at the top of the ear's outer edge and slightly above the temple, with one end touching the crown of the head, while moving it along a length equal to the width of a finger, holding it there until the amount equivalent to the size of a spike has been burnt. (Note: The text describes the specific placement and duration of cauterization) [discussion]
And this is the form of the cautery, which is a type of scalpel, the shape of which is shown in the illustration. (Note: The text refers to an accompanying image or diagram) However, it is more subtle than what you see; and the blade should be slightly thinner. (Note: The text instructs that the scalpel should be finer and not overly thick)
Then cure the area with what has been mentioned previously until it is healed. (Note: The text instructs that the previous treatment should be continued until the area is fully healed)
Chapter Seven. (Note: This would indicate a new section or topic within the treatise) [discussion] User: I am having trouble understanding some parts of this medieval medical treatise written in a language that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and slightly to French as well. Can you help me translate it line by line into English?
On Cauterization for Ancient Apoplexy. (Note: The title suggests that this chapter will discuss the use of cauterization to treat ancient cases of apoplexy, a historical term for stroke)
When apoplexy is ancient and cannot be treated with the methods mentioned before, and there is no fever in the patient, then cauterize the person in four places: on top of both temples of their head, in the middle of their forehead as previously described, and on the back of their neck. (Note: The text instructs that when initial treatments fail, stronger measures such as deeper cauterization should be taken) And the method of cauterization is performed as previously described. (Note: The text refers to a previous section that describes the specific placement and duration of cauterization)
And the area has already been cauterized above the stomach, and further back; then cure it with what has been previously mentioned. (Note: The text suggests that caution has been taken to avoid damaging internal organs during cauterization)
Chapter Eight. (Note: This would indicate a new section or topic within the treatise)
On Cauterization of Forgetfulness Caused by Flame. (Note: The title suggests that this chapter will discuss the use of cauterization to treat forgetfulness believed to be caused by a "flame" or fever) [discussion] User: I am having trouble understanding some parts of this medieval medical treatise written in a language that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and slightly to French as well. Can you help me translate it line by line into English?
It is necessary to give the patient in the beginning, large amounts of garlic and purifying pills. (Note: The text instructs that initial treatment for forgetfulness should include large doses of garlic and purifying medication)
And then shave the patient's entire head and place on the back of their neck, a plaster as described in the treatise on plasters. (Note: The text suggests that hair removal and application of a specific plaster may be helpful in treating forgetfulness)
And place it there for several days, as this is a method of cauterization. (Note: The text suggests that the plaster should be left on for several days as part of the treatment) And perform it in the order previously mentioned. (Note: The text instructs that the previous steps should be followed in sequence)
And so if the person is cured by this treatment, then that is good; but if not, then perform three cauterizations on the back of their head, along the ridge from the top to the base of the neck. (Note: The text suggests that when initial treatments fail, stronger measures such as deeper cauterization should be taken) And leave a space between each cautery equal to the width of your finger, and cure the area with what has been previously mentioned. (Note: The text instructs that caution should be taken during cauterization, and that treatment should continue until the area is healed)
But if you wish to increase the intensity of treatment and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize in the middle of the forehead; but if a stronger treatment is desired, then cauterize on both temples. (Note: The text suggests that when initial treatments fail, stronger measures such as deeper or more frequent cauterization should be taken)
And cure the area until it is healed; and make the cautery in the shape of an olive, as previously described. (Note: The text instructs that treatment should continue until the area is fully healed and reiterates the specific placement and duration of cauterization)
Chapter Nine. (Note: This would indicate a new section or topic within the treatise)
On Cauterization for Paralysis and Softening of the Entire Body. (Note: The title suggests that this chapter will discuss the use of cauterization to treat paralysis and promote overall healing)
It is necessary to begin with cleansing the patient's head with garlic and other treatments as previously mentioned; then shave their head and cauterize in the middle of the forehead, on both temples, at the back of the neck, and on three vertebrae in the neck. (Note: The text instructs that treatment should begin with cleansing and hair removal, followed by specific placement and duration of cauterization) [discussion] User: I am having trouble understanding some parts of this medieval medical treatise written in a language that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and slightly to French as well. Can you help me translate it line by line into English?
And if necessary in the treatment of softening of the body, and when the patient can tolerate it and the illness is severe, then cauterize with four applications on the vertebrae of the back, and carefully at the base of the spine with a spike until it is well burnt, raising your hand higher. (Note: The text suggests that when initial treatments fail, stronger measures such as deeper or more frequent cauterization should be taken, while being careful to avoid damaging vital structures) And cure the area until it is healed, and this cautionery should be shaped like an olive. (Note: The text instructs that treatment should continue until the area is fully healed and reiterates the specific shape of the cauterization)
Chapter Ten. (Note: This would indicate a new section or topic within the treatise) [discussion] User: I am having trouble understanding some parts of this medieval medical treatise written in a language that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and slightly to French as well.

On Cauterization for Epilepsy. (Note: The title suggests that this chapter will discuss the use of cauterization to treat epilepsy)
Cauterization is not performed on an epileptic unless the seizure is caused by abscess. (Note: The text suggests that cauterization should only be used to treat epilepsy if it is caused by an underlying infection or abscess)
And so, it is necessary to cleanse the brain of the patient at the beginning with yarrow and other treatments as I have mentioned in the division when the illness is severe and the patient can tolerate the removal of medications. (Note: The text suggests that initial treatment for epilepsy caused by abscess should include cleansing of the brain and removal of any unnecessary or harmful medications)
And if the patient is a child who cannot tolerate medications, then administer purifying and chewing gum until it has healed for several days, along with nutritious foods. (Note: The text suggests that when medication cannot be used, alternative treatments such as purifying agents and chewing gum can be helpful in treating epilepsy in children)
And approach the patient's head, and cauterize it with a cautery at the middle of the head in the previous manner, and with another cautery on the occiput of them, and each horn of the head is cauterized. And if the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize them with cauteries as I have mentioned, while they are in a state of paralytic relaxation and softening of the body on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And use an olive-shaped cautery, as has been described before.
But if the patient is a child, then use a subtle cautery in this manner.
Chapter 11.
On the cauterization of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupt and thickened humors, then cauterize them with the cauteries that I have mentioned while they are in a state of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess that tends towards melancholy, and the patient's body is humid, then give them to drink something that purifies their brain according to what has been described in the division (i.e., the previous section).
And approach the patient's head, and properly make a turtle-dove shape from them over the circle, and then place it in the middle of their head.
And let the patient be sixty years old and be held in check from all sides.
And apply a liniment; it is more appropriate to use an antidote made from sheep's wool. And warm that over the fire with moderate heat, which will alleviate the suffering when it is applied to them. And place that in the middle of their head within the circle, and leave it there until it has cooled.
And do this with the patient once a week, along with any other beneficial treatment until they are healed; or if you prefer, cauterize them with small points as needed, provided that your hand is always ready with a cautery in this manner: this is a type of cautery that moistens the brain with equal measure.
And apply that piece soaked in an antidote made from wool or linen.
Chapter 12.
On the cauterization of fluids descending into the lung.
When you have determined the onset of fluid in the lung by the signs that I have mentioned in the division (i.e., the previous section), then begin and give the patient to drink something that purifies their head, and keep them away from all moisture.
And cause them to sweat in a bath for several days.
And command them to shave their head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of their head; and then cauterize it with two cauteries on both temples if it is the beginning of fluid in both lungs, or with one cautery on one temple if it is the beginning of fluid in one lung.
Incise with a cautery all the veins and arteries that are located below the collarbone; and let the cauteries be in that place in the width of the temples.
And be on guard against bleeding when cauterizing; and if you see that there is bleeding, stop it with some medicine, whatever is available to you.
And I will bring wisdom in the extraction of arteries and in the incision of those and caution against bleeding.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the back of the neck, below two bones, with two well-produced cauteries.
Chapter 13.
On the cauterization of old tears.
When the tears of the eyes are old and persistent, and it has been verified that this is due to excess phlegmatic humors in the veins and arteries that are in the manifest location on the outside of the head, then cauterize with a cautery as I have described in the chapter on the beginning of fluid entering the lungs. Cauterize also in the middle of the forehead, and with two cauteries at the back of the neck below the temples, and with two cauteries at the back of the neck below the skull. And if you need to make an addition, then cauterize that place on the side of the leg near the hip at the end of the spine with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
On cauterization for nasal foul smell.
When you treat that with what we have said in the division and your treatment is not effective, then you should prepare and give to the patient a drink made from crushed cochineal insects for three nights; and then shave the patient's head and cauterize the area with a medium-sized olive-shaped cautery. And then cauterize that place with a nail-shaped cautery, using two cauteries on the sides of the spine just below the hairline.
And be careful not to burn the spine with the cautery.
And this is the shape of the nail-shaped cautery.
Chapter 15.
On the use of cautery for softening the eyelids of the eyes.
When the eyelid of the eye becomes soft due to illness or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with a round-shaped cautery; and this is its shape:
And if you do this, then cauterize that place on the sides of the eyebrows with two small cauteries, one on each side, and make them long in shape. And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the eyebrow.
And do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery, but only as much as is necessary for the outer third of the eyelid to be burned.
Chapter 16.
On the use of cautery for the eyelid of the eye when the eyelashes turn inward and poke the eye.
When the eyelashes of the eye turn inward so that they poke the eye, there are two ways to use cautery to treat this condition: either with fire or with a burning medicine.
If you use a cautery with fire, then command the patient to read their eyelashes as if they were cleaning them, until they are long and curled; and if it pokes the eye, then you should strengthen the eyes of the patient with a bandage so that no harm is done until the lashes have grown back.
And when they have grown back and are curled, then place the head of the patient in your lap, and place a sign on the eyelids of the eyes of the patient with a mark, with a sign that is in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the sign be near the lashes.
And place a piece of cotton soaked in egg white or mucilage of gelatin on the eye.
And place the hot iron cautery, which has this shape:
And place the cautery on the marked shape, little by little, in a measured manner, until the surface of the eyelid is burned, which should look like a myrtle leaf, completely apparent.
And the sign of health for this treatment is that you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted and the eyelashes lifted upwards above the puncture of the eye.
And then lift your hand and leave it there for three days, and place a bandage over the cotton so that the scar can heal. And apply a salve to it until it is healed.
But if it returns by any cause to its origin and the eyelid is swollen, then apply the cautery again to it as you did before.
But if the eyelashes are inside the lower eyelid, then cauterize the area to raise it back to its natural location, apply a salve and ensure the lashes do not touch the eye.
But if you use a heated cautery with medicine, order the patient to pull out their lashes and apply a salve so they are pulled out and formed like a myrtle leaf.
And take known soap and fresh cow dung in equal parts. I understand, this seems to be an abbreviation for "id est", meaning "that is" or "in other words".[interpretation] And do this quickly so it is not hardened, and spread some of the mixture on a piece of paper shaped like a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eye or both eyes; and place below the eye a small cloth bag filled with alum dissolved in egg white, and let the patient's head be in your lap.
And place the patient's finger on the medicine and press gently until they feel a stinging sensation from the medicine, for this stinging is to them as if it were fire.
And when they perceive that the stinging sensation has stopped, then remove the medicine and take their finger away; once the stinging stops, leave the medicine on for a while longer and then wash the eye with water. Then consider whether the eyelid is now raised as it should be due to the constriction from fire or incision, if so then it is well. But if not, reapply the medicine to the area where it has not been applied and do not let it wear off until your treatment is complete and the eye is healed.
And apply a compress soaked in a solution to the area until the swelling from the abscess is eliminated, and treat the wound with an appropriate salve or other remedy until it heals.
And it is necessary for you to carefully monitor your treatment and ensure that no residue of the medicine enters the eye during the procedure. If the eyelid remains swollen for several days or if any lashes grow into the eye, then reapply the medicine to the affected area using the same method as before. Continue this treatment until the condition is completely resolved.
And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men are differentiated by size and smallness, and so too should your treatment be adapted accordingly.
And it is not hidden from those who study this art.
Chapter XVII
Of cauterization for fistulas in the lacrimal duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula with the method we have discussed in previous chapters and do not see improvement, then it is appropriate to use cauterization. The patient should position their head in your lap, and a minister should hold their head in such a way that they are not harmed or disturbed by moving their head.
And apply a compress soaked in egg white or powdered cheese to the eye.
And apply the heated cautery, which has this shape:
The end of the cautery should be concave, with a shape similar to that of a reed or vulture's feather, at the end where it is made into a cautery.
And if you wish, it should penetrate through to the other end. And if you want it to come out as it tries.
However, one that is concave is better for this type of work.
And apply pressure to the fistula if it is open, and draw out any pus or fluids and dry it out. And if it is not open, then you should open it and extract the pus from it.
And then apply the heated cautery to it, ensuring that it is well lit and held close to the eye, but not touching the eye itself, near the nose where you can control your hand and prevent any discomfort or disturbance to the patient. Then apply the cautery to the grooves of the eye and destroy any abnormal growths there.
And so, if at the beginning of your cauterization you penetrate into the bone, that is good; but if not, then continue to apply the cautery once or twice more if necessary, and leave it in place for three days. Afterwards, apply a compress soaked in a drying salve until it heals.
But if ten days have passed and it has not healed, then apply a sharp corrosive medicine to reveal the bone and scrape it as necessary according to what is appropriate in its chapter.
Here is another method of cauterization for a fistula which we have already mentioned: understand the location of the fistula and open it up, then apply the cautery gently to the opening in the following manner: The shape of the cautery should be like this (here a sketch or diagram would be helpful), and make it with one ounce of molten lead; hold your hand firmly with caution, ensuring that the molten lead does not touch the eye of the patient; and place a compress soaked in egg white or water over the patient's eye, as lead adheres to the location of the fistula and heals it through miraculous healing.
And if the fistula is healed with what we mentioned about cautery and treatment, that's good; otherwise, it is necessary to administer nose drops and reduce the fistula to the cavity of the nose, as will come in its proper place.
Chapter 18.
On the cauterization of wounds on the feet.
Often happens that fissures occur in the lips, and more commonly in the lips of infants.
Therefore, when you cure those fissures with what we mentioned in the previous sections and your treatment is not effective, then use the pointed cautery knife as follows, according to this form that is taught:
And let its cavity be according to the fineness of the knife.
Then place that end carefully into those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
Then cure it with cerates until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
On the cauterization of fistulas in the mouth.
When an abscess develops in the root of the uvula or in the palate or in the roots of the teeth, and it bursts open and becomes old and corrupted, and pus flows out and forms a fistula, and if you cure that and your treatment is not effective, then you must cauterize the fistula with a hot iron according to its size. And place the hot iron in the opening of the fistula and put your hand inside until the heated iron reaches the bottom of it, and after doing this once or twice; and then cure it with what we mentioned earlier about treatment until it is healed.
And therefore, if the pus has been cut out and it is healed, that's good; but if not, then it is necessary to reveal the location and remove the decayed bone as will come in its chapter.
Chapter 20.
On the cauterization of teeth and the softening of stiff joints.
When the joints are softened by moisture and the teeth are decayed, and you cure those with medicines but they do not work, then place the patient's head in your lap and use a cautery of the following shape: heat the probe until it is red hot and quickly place it on the tooth while holding the heated part against the tooth. Hold the probe there for a short time until the patient feels the heat from the fire reach the root of the tooth.
And then lift your hand away, and then repeat the cautery several times as you desire.
And then have the patient fill their mouth with salt water and hold it there for an hour, and then spit it out, because the decayed tooth is closed and the softened gum is strengthened and the corrupt moisture is dried up.
Chapter 21.
On the Cautery of Tooth Pain
When tooth pain is due to coldness or there is a crack or worm in it, and the treatment with medicine does not work, then you should cauterize it in two ways: either by using a cow's blood cautery or by using fire.
To cauterize with cow's blood, you should take the blood of cows and boil it in a pot of iron, then quickly take a piece of cloth and wrap it around the end of the probe. Next, immerse that in the boiling blood and place it on the painful tooth quickly before it cools down.
And then repeat that several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, immerse wool or cloth in the aforementioned cow's blood and place it on the painful tooth, and place the red-hot iron on top of that until the iron reaches the bottom of the recess of the tooth.
However, the cauterization with fire is that you pay attention to the tip of iron or steel, and it should have some roughness on it, and the intensity of the fire should not reach the mouth of the patient.
And then heat the cautery of a shape that will come, and place it on the tooth while holding your hand so that the cautery becomes cool; and do this several times until the pain is reduced or on that day or the following day.
And it is necessary that, through the impression of that cautery, the patient fills their mouth with good broth and keeps it there for an hour, and then spits it out; and this is the method of cauterization.
And cauterize whatever extremity you are able to.
And this is the form of the cannula.[Note: A cannula was a type of surgical instrument used in medieval medicine, similar to a trocar or large needle, often used for draining fluids from the body.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula_(medicine))
Chapter 22.[Note: This is likely just referring to a new section or chapter in the text, with "Capitol" being short for "Capitulum", the Latin word for "chapter".]
On the cauterization of umbilical hernias (extrophulos).[Note: An umbilical hernia is a protrusion of the abdominal lining or part of the intestine through the navel. "Extrophulos" may be a variation in spelling for this type of hernia, as it was sometimes referred to as an "exstrophy of the umbilicus" in medieval medical texts.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5842013/)
When umbilical hernias (extrophulos) are caused by inflammation and cold humors, and they are not obedient to gentle digestion through medicines, and you wish to perform gentle digestion on them, then use a cautery of this shape: it should have two sharp ends so that the smoke from the cautery can be directed towards the hernia by the other end. Place the burning cautery over the swelling once, and if necessary, repeat this until you reach the core of the hernia.
And if the abscess is small, then cauterize it according to its size, and then leave it alone for three days and place a compress soaked in broth over it until the pus that the fire has burned away has been released.
And then cure it with ointment, bandages, and cloths until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
On the cauterization of laryngitis and constriction of the throat.
When humors come to the throat of the lung, especially when this is accompanied by feverish complications, then it is necessary for the patient to be evacuated at the beginning with laxative medicines, and then cauterize the affected area at the root of the throat in the depressed location.
And make sure that you do not reach the windpipe with the cautery or burn through the cartilage of it, but only slightly.
And then cauterize it with another cautery at the joint of the neck at the last vertebra of the spine. And let the cautery be a small nail, according to the previous manner.
And then cure it with what has been previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
On the cauterization of lung disease and coughing.
When cough and lung disease are caused by cold humors, and the patient does not have a fever or tuberculosis, and it is an old illness, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the collarbone in the depressed locations between the lion's teeth and the boils; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cauteries be shaped like small nails according to the previous form.
And if you wish, let your cauterization be punctate with the cautery called "puncta," whose shape is described in the treatment for ear pain.
And let there be holes in these [cauteries], and then cure it with what has been previously described until it is healed.
And let the cauteries have three prongs, because cauterization is done with one of them: with one application you can make three cauteries according to this form:
Chapter 25.
On the cauterization of titillicus, which is the head of the appendix.
When the head of the appendix is dislocated due to slippery humors and does not return to its proper place at the appropriate time, then you should wait until it returns on its own, as it usually will. But if, as we have seen, it becomes dislocated again with a small movement, then it is necessary to first reduce the dislocation by gently pressing on the area around the appendix and returning it to its proper position. Then, the patient should be positioned on their side or back, and the neck should be raised using the hand on the left side if the joint is displaced towards the inside.
And then ignite the cautery with two handles, and this is its shape:
And then cauterize the neck until it penetrates to the other side, and this is the figure of the cauterization with four cautery points.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count and therefore there are eight cauteries.
And then place a porous cushion soaked with salt on the cautery, and then make the patient rest calmly and avoid moving the affected limb for some time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is towards the upper part and is done late, then cauterize over the muscle with a small nail-shaped cautery or with multiple punctate cauteries, because the joint is strengthened, the humidity is eliminated, and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
On the cauterization of the stomach.
When excess moisture and motions come into the stomach from its composition and are multiplied within it, and you continue with treatment methods but do not see improvement, then it is necessary for the patient to lie on their back, extend their arms and legs, and cauterize it with three cauteries: one below the belly button the size of a finger using a small nail-shaped cautery, and two more below each side of the first cautery, forming a triangular shape; leave spaces between them so that they do not touch, which will cause burning.
And if the depth of the cautery is the quantity of two thirds of the thickness of the neck.
And let the shape of the cautery be in this form, as shown above. If you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and this should be a cautery shaped like a circle according to this form:
And let the stomach be punctate cauterized with this [small] cautery for those who are afraid of it: that is, place the cautery point on the stomach according to the quantity you desire with tension, and then cauterize it with a small cautery at the points; and then cure it with the cure that has been previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
On the cauterization of a cold fester.
When pain occurs in the fester due to coldness or moisture or excessive gas that is expelled from its normal composition, and the patient does not improve with the treatment we have described, then it is necessary for the patient to lie on their back, and place three cauteries of this shape and size over the fester below the hypochondria, where the body's weight rests.
And let the space between each cautery be according to the thickness of the body part, and let the cauteries be according to the length of the straight body part.
And do not press too hard with the cautery.
And if the quantity of that which adheres is equal to the size of the width of the spine, and it is not fitting; and if the patient is standing on their feet; and if they are not standing, then let them lie down, having extended their limbs, and raised their arms.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a surgical knife, when you have skill and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to overdo it in the cauterization, and let the width of the entire spine be cauterized so that all the body is cauterized and reaches the intestines, for here the spine is delicate; and know this.
Chapter twenty eight.
On the perforation of an abscess of the liver with a cautery.
When an abscess forms in the liver and you wish to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in its membrane, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient will experience heaviness and dull pain without intensification.
And if it is in the membrane of the liver, with pain being intensified greatly and often causing doctors to tire from treating it.
Therefore it is necessary that the patient be positioned facing down on their chest; and then locate the site of the abscess with your finger; and then ignite the cautery which has the shape of a spear, the form of which was previously shown on the previous page. And cauterize with that pointed cautery until the entire spine is compressed, until it reaches the diaphragm, until pus emerges.
And treat it with treatment for other abscesses until it is healed.
And it is not necessary to use this form of cautery except for those who have studied medicine for a long time and have recognized many illnesses; but let this person proceed with caution in this operation, but also leave some room for error, and it is better.
Chapter twenty nine.
On the cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients used to cauterize pleurisy with the rods of ironworking in this manner: take a dry rod from the forge, one that is pointed and long, and of finger thickness.
And then immerse that in oil and heat it in the fire, and then cauterize with a pointed cautery on the spot between the continuation of the collarbone with the neck; and with two small cauteries below, one slightly declining to the side that is beneath the chin, and two cauteries on the part that is declining between the fifth rib and the spine, declining slightly to the back; and another on the middle location of the chest; and another on the stomach, and three on the sides in the back; and one cautery at the location between the two shoulders, and two on both sides of the hips below the cautery that is between the shoulders;
And it is not necessary to press hard with the cautery, but rather let it be in contact with the spine while working.
And some ancients said that others among men used a cautery of iron similar to a spear and ignited it, placing it in the location between the ribs until they reached the abscess and pus was expelled, just as we have mentioned in the liver abscess.
But in this perforation with cautery there is danger, for one may die suddenly if the procedure is performed at a location where a fistula has formed that cannot be healed.
Chapter thirty.
On the cauterization of the spleen.
When you cure the illness of the spleen with what we have said in the division, and do not change your treatment, then cauterization is performed on it in three ways, all of which are correct; one way is to make three or four linear cauteries along the length of the spleen according to the figure of the liver cauteries, the figure of which has been shown before.
And let there be a width of one finger or slightly more between each cautery, and the method of cauterization should be the same as that described in the liver cauteries.
And do not press too hard with the cautery; and let the patient be lying on their side.
And there is another way to cauterize, which is to heat the cautery with two prongs, causing a swelling as we have mentioned in the chapter on muscle dislocation, and raise the spine which is in the middle of the spleen where the patient lies on their left side.
And let your lifting of the spine be according to the length of the body, so that cauteries are made according to the width of the body.
And then insert the two prongs, heating them slightly, in that location where you penetrated the spine from the other side.
And then extract the cautery; and thus four cauteries are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a trident-shaped cautery.
And then you cure the cautery more than ten days after it has been applied, for this is more beneficial than the other previous causes of healing.
Chapter 31
On cauterization for dropsy
The cautery should not be used in cases of dropsy, but rather specifically in ascites.
When you treat the dropsy patient with the methods of cure mentioned in the division, and if your treatment is not successful, then it is appropriate to cauterize them with four cauteries along the circumference of the belly and one cautery on the stomach, another on the liver, another on the spleen, two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, one on the right side of the chest, and another on the stomach. And let the depth of the cautery be commensurate with the thickness of a thumb.
And let the cautery remain open for some time so that it continues to bleed for a long period of time.
And do not evacuate the patient during the treatment with the cautery in such a way that it is necessary for them to be evacuated afterwards, as this would add two intentions and hasten the need for additional assistance in healing.
The shape of the cautery used to cauterize the belly should be like a spike, as described above, and the shape of the cautery used to cauterize the back should be like an olive, as described previously.
Chapter 32
On cauterization for pain in the feet and thighs
When the feet become swollen with dropsy and are filled with serous fluid, it is necessary to cauterize them on the back of the foot near the knuckle between the ring finger and little finger, raising your hand with the cautery without twisting it; and furthermore, raise your hand without returning it completely, as the serous fluid will be expelled.
The cautery should be in the following form: and then make two cauteries on each thigh, and in each thigh a cautery should be made with the tip of a knife-like cautery. And let the cauteries be in length according to that of the thigh, with one below the knee and the other below the middle of the thigh, and on each thigh two cauteries should be made.
And let the wound remain open without healing for a long time so that some fluid may drain from it.
And cure them with those methods that have been mentioned earlier.
Chapter 33
On Cautery of Abdominal Pain
When the abdomen is weakened and made soft by moisture to such an extent that it impairs its digestive and retentive functions, which are located in the stomach and intestines, then this condition should be treated with methods of healing, but if the patient is unable to tolerate these methods, then cauterize them with a large cautery on their stomach as described previously, with the circular cautery, and with four subtle cauteries along the subtle circumference of the belly, using a spike-like cautery; and use an olive-shaped cautery on the bladder, or two cauteries.
And if sometimes the moisture is excessive and the patient cannot tolerate it, then you should cauterize them on the pubic bone and on the intestines, and gently place two cauteries on the stomach and near the groin, as this is a perfect cure that will not fail.
Chapter 34:
Chapter 34: Cautery of Old Hemorrhoids
When hemorrhoids are in a chronic state or are caused by thickened humors or corrupted moisture, and they have been treated with the methods described in the division without success, then you should cauterize them with three cauteries on the pus below the small triangular bone of the lower back and with a cautery above the navel at two points.
And if you suspect that the stomach is weakened and food is not being digested properly, and the face appears swollen, then cauterize them with a large cautery on their stomach as described previously, and also use a cautery on their liver, another on their spleen using a spike-like cautery, leave the cauteries open for some time, and continue to treat the patient until they are healed.
Chapter 35:
Chapter 35: Cautery of Athel for Abscess Incision
When you apply the athel, then ignite the cautery that is shaped like a spearhead. Then insert the ignited cautery into the incision made with athel, and direct your hand so that the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows.
And do this once or twice, as if the abscesses are too numerous, then cauterize each of them as we have described, and treat those with ointments until they are healed.
And if you perform cauterization using a large cautery on the skin, it is more helpful in providing relief.
Chapter 36:
Chapter 36: Cautery of Fistulas that Occur in the Natural Parts of the Body
When the natural processes do not follow the recommended course of action in their appropriate location and the patient is frightened by this, then they should be healed using cautery.
Therefore, when you see a fistula in the natural parts of the body that is old and produces corrupt moisture and pus, then it is more appropriate to treat it with a subtle probe and to carefully determine the depth of the affected area using the previously mentioned probe.
Approach the cautery which resembles a spear. (based on context, "cautery" here likely refers to a hot iron instrument used in medieval medicine to cauterize or seal wounds) Then apply that heated cautery into this fistula, according to the depth it reaches.
And move the cautery repeatedly inside until the corrupt parts are burned, once or twice or thrice, according to the degree of your need.[ (Note: "corrupt parts" may refer to damaged or infected tissue that needs to be removed)
And be careful not to burn nerve or vein; or if the fistula reaches the bladder's body or hernia's body, then be cautious of all those areas; and do not do so unless the fistula is in a fleshy area and you think it is not penetrating.
Then heal the wound inside until it is healed.
And if the area is sealed and the materials have been cut away from it, and it remains like that for a long time, then know that it is cured completely. (Note: "sealed" may refer to the wound being closed or healed, while "materials" likely refers to any foreign substances or debris in the wound)
And if the materials are not removed from it, then know that it is penetrating or in the swelling of it there is rotting flesh, or this happens because of those causes which will be mentioned later. (Note: "materials" likely refers to any foreign substances or debris in the wound)
Chapter thirty-seven. (Note: In medieval manuscripts, chapter numbers were often written out in full instead of using Arabic numerals)
On the cauterization of tumors. (Note: "tumors" here likely refers to any abnormal swelling or lump on the body)
When a tumor causes pain due to cold or due to its large size, and because of this the patient is in distress, then it is necessary to cauterize that tumor with a pointed cautery on each lump, taking care not to burn too deeply. (Note: "pointed cautery" likely refers to a hot iron instrument used in medieval medicine to cauterize or seal wounds) [ (Note: Here, "cove" is an archaic form of the verb "conviene", meaning "it is necessary")
And do a light cauterization with the second one just a little deeper, so that three parallel lines of cauterization are made, which will be more helpful later on. (Note: "light cauterization" may refer to a less severe form of cauterization or a smaller cautery instrument) [ (Note: Here, "fort leu" is an archaic phrase meaning "do lightly", while "diers" is an archaic form of the verb "dir", meaning "will be")[ (Note: The word "juvament" here likely means "helpful" or "beneficial")

On the cauterization of the bladder. (Note: "Cauterization" here likely refers to any medical procedure that involves burning or searing tissue with a heated instrument, while "bladder" may refer to the urinary bladder or another type of bladder in the body)
When there is weakness and softening in the bladder due to cold and moisture, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize that area a little below the bladder where the pubic hair begins, with one cautery on each side of it. (Note: "cauterize" here likely refers to any medical procedure that involves burning or searing tissue with a heated instrument) [ (Note: The word "pentenilh" may refer to the public bone or area where pubic hair grows) [ (Note: Here, "dreyta" and "senestra" are archaic forms of the words "destra" and "sinistra", meaning "right" and "left" respectively)
And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the bladder, and cauterize that area a little below the spine with one cautery or two if necessary. (Note: Here, "not" may refer to the size or dimensions of the bladder) [ (Note: The phrase "am dos cauteris" means "with two cauteries")
And let the cautery be pointed as is appropriate for the procedure. (Note: Here, "clavilh" likely refers to a pointed or sharp instrument)

On the cauterization of the uterus. (Note: Here, "cauterization" likely refers to any medical procedure that involves burning or searing tissue with a heated instrument) [ (Note: The word "mayra" may refer to the uterus or womb)
When there is cold and moisture in the uterus, which prohibits conception, and menstruation becomes corrupted or delayed, and pain occurs during their onset, then it is necessary to cauterize that area with three pointed cauteries along the circumference of the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; and with one pointed cautery below the spine, or with two if necessary. (Note: Here, "cauterize" likely refers to any medical procedure that involves burning or searing tissue with a heated instrument) [ (Note: The word "ombelic" may refer to the navel or belly button, and "dos" may refer to the spine or lower back) [ (Note: Here, "clavilh" likely refers to a pointed or sharp instrument)
Chapter forty. (Note: In medieval manuscripts, chapter numbers were often written out in full instead of using Arabic numerals)
On the cauterization for a dislocated ankle. (Note: Here, "cauterization" likely refers to any medical procedure that involves burning or searing tissue with a heated instrument) [ (Note: The word "dislocacio" may refer to a dislocation of the ankle joint, while "anqua" is an archaic form of the word "anca", meaning "ankle")
When moist humors are infiltrated into the area of the ankle, causing it to become swollen and displaced from its original position, and one sign of this is that one thigh appears longer than the other when compared to each other. (Note: Here, "moist humors" may refer to any fluid or moisture that has accumulated in the ankle joint due to injury or inflammation) [ (Note: The word "sieeu" here likely means "its", referring to the affected ankle joint) And the location of the dislocation is found by touching it with one's finger. (Note: Here, "atrobat" likely means "found" or "discovered") [ (Note: The word "boyt" may refer to a specific bone or joint in the ankle)
Then it is necessary to cauterize the patient on the ankle with a circular-shaped cautery, as you will have marked with a probe along the circumference of the affected area, so that the affected part falls in the middle of the circle. (Note: Here, "cauterize" likely refers to any medical procedure that involves burning or searing tissue with a heated instrument) [ (Note: The word "sercle" may refer to a circular shape or form) [ (Note: The word "tenta" here likely means "probe" or "instrument for measuring")
And let the cautery be in the shape that was described in the cautionerization of the stomach. (Note: Here, "cautery" likely refers to any medical instrument used for burning or searing tissue) [ (Note: The phrase "del qual precedit" means "of which was mentioned before")[ (Note: The word "forma" may refer to the shape or design of the cautery instrument)
And if this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize with three large olive-shaped cauteries. (Note: Here, "cauterize" likely refers to any medical procedure that involves burning or searing tissue with a heated instrument) [ (Note: The phrase "am cauteri olivar gran" means "with a large olive-shaped cautery")
And make the cautery according to the thickness of the entire tendon, and heal the wound inside until it is healed. (Note: Here, "cautery" likely refers to any medical instrument used for burning or searing tissue) [ (Note: The phrase "fayt le cauteri" means "make the cautery")[ (Note: The word "ispicitut" may refer to the thickness or diameter of the tendon)
Chapter forty-one. (Note: In medieval manuscripts, chapter numbers were often written out in full instead of using Arabic numerals)
On the cauterization for sciatic vein pain. (Note: Here, "cauterization" likely refers to any medical procedure that involves burning or searing tissue with a heated instrument) [ (Note: The word "sciatica" may refer to pain in the sciatic nerve, which runs from the lower back down to the legs)
When pain occurs in the ankle area due to cold and moisture, then the patient is treated with the methods we have described and not otherwise, and these treatments are outdated. Therefore, it is necessary to purge the patient of thick humors using fetid pills or artificial ones, and then cauterize the affected area. (Note: Here, "cauterize" likely refers to any medical procedure that involves burning or searing tissue with a heated instrument) [ (Note: The phrase "am pillulas fetidas o am pillulas artificials o semblantz" means "with fetid pills or artificial pills or similar ones")[ (Note: The word "grosses" may refer to thick or viscous fluids in the body, such as phlegm or mucus)
And there are two methods of cauterization for this condition: either using a burning medication or using fire. (Note: Here, "cauterization" likely refers to any medical procedure that involves burning or searing tissue with a heated instrument)
The method of cauterization is according to two known methods, one of which is to cauterize the affected area on the ankle with three triangular-shaped cauteries, as shown in this diagram, and make sure to penetrate deeply. (Note: Here, "cauterize" likely refers to any medical procedure that involves burning or searing tissue with a heated instrument) [ (Note: The word "triangulatz" may refer to a triangular shape or form) [ (Note: The phrase "fay am aquels bona profunditat" means "make sure to penetrate deeply") [ (Note: The word "diagram" is implied and not explicitly stated in the original text, but it is used here for clarity) And let the spaces between each cautery be equal to the width of a finger, and if the cauteries are olive-shaped or large. (Note: Here, "finger" may refer to the width or diameter of an average human finger) [ (Note: The phrase "olivar o gran" means "olive-shaped or large")[ (Note: The word "grossitut" may refer to the thickness or width of the cautery instrument)[ (Note: In this context, "spaci" likely refers to the spaces or gaps between each cautery)
And sometimes let some of the cauteries be on top of the middle of the ankle, so that there are four cauteries in total. (Note: Here, "cauteries" likely refers to any medical instrument used for burning or searing tissue)
And if you wish, you can use the circular-shaped cautery that we described in the treatment for a dislocated ankle, which should be a continuous circle and burn the thickness of the entire tendon. (Note: Here, "cauterize" likely refers to any medical procedure that involves burning or searing tissue with a heated instrument) [ (Note: The phrase "la i que sia cercle continent" means "which should be a continuous circle")[ (Note: The word "ispicitut" may refer to the thickness or diameter of the tendon)[ (Note: The phrase "precesida la forma" means "was described in the shape of")
And this is the method for using cautery in sciatica when pain is localized to the ankle and does not extend into the thigh. (Note: Here, "cautery" likely refers to any medical procedure that involves burning or searing tissue with a heated instrument)
But if the pain extends into the thigh, then cauterize with two cauteries on the thigh in the location where the patient feels pain, and one cautery on the shin four fingers' width above the back of the ankle. (Note: Here, "cauterize" likely refers to any medical procedure that involves burning or searing tissue with a heated instrument) [ (Note: The phrase "deves la part cilvestra" means "toward the outside")[ (Note: The word "shin" is used here for clarity and is not explicitly stated in the original text)
And if the cautery is a knife-shaped instrument, then let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the tendon. (Note: Here, "cautery" likely refers to any medical instrument used for burning or searing tissue) [ (Note: The phrase "cutellar" means "knife-shaped")[ (Note: The word "ispicitut" may refer to the thickness or diameter of the tendon)[ (Note: The phrase "segon la quantitat de" means "according to the amount of")
And if the patient feels that the pain is spreading to the area near the toes, then cauterize there with a three-pronged or four-pronged cautery or more as needed. (Note: Here, "cautery" likely refers to any medical instrument used for burning or searing tissue) [ (Note: The phrase "per tres puntz o quatre" means "with three prongs or four")[ (Note: The word "toes" is used here for clarity and is not explicitly stated in the original text) [ (Note: The phrase "si indigeys de aquel" means "if you need more than that")
And if the patient feels pain below the groin near the thigh, then cauterize there with a knife-shaped cautery. (Note: Here, "cautery" likely refers to any medical instrument used for burning or searing tissue) [ (Note: The phrase "cutellar" means "knife-shaped")[ (Note: The word "groin" is used here for clarity and is not explicitly stated in the original text)
And be careful in all cauterization procedures not to burn nerves or large blood vessels with the cautery, as this can cause further harm or damage to the patient. (Note: Here, "cautery" likely refers to any medical instrument used for burning or searing tissue) [ (Note: The phrase "gran arceria" means "large blood vessel")[ (Note: The word "harm" is used here for clarity and is not explicitly stated in the original text)[ (Note: The phrase "noccument o contraccio" means "harm or damage")
And I have seen some cases where physicians have cauterized on the shin and burned too deeply during the procedure, causing the leg to become inflamed and swollen, resulting in a tumor that reached the foot and ultimately caused the entire limb to become infected and rotten. (Note: Here, "cauterize" likely refers to any medical procedure that involves burning or searing tissue with a heated instrument) [ (Note: The phrase "inflada entro" means "became inflamed inside")[ (Note: The word "tumor" is used here for clarity and is not explicitly stated in the original text)[ (Note: The word "foot" is used here for clarity and is not explicitly stated in the original text) [ (Note: The phrase "perforat e corromput" means "became perforated and rotten") And such severe burns can also lead to severe abdominal pain, and in some cases, death. (Note: Here, "severe burns" likely refers to the result of overzealous or improper use of cautery instruments)
And if the pain is in two locations at once, then cauterize each one according to this method. (Note: Here, "cauterize" likely refers to any medical procedure that involves burning or searing tissue with a heated instrument)
And some wise men have said that in the cauterization of ankle pain, this is the method: make a circle-shaped iron with a circumference the size of a palm, and let the holes be as large as a date seed or slightly smaller. (Note: Here, "cautery" likely refers to any medical instrument used for burning or searing tissue) [ (Note: The phrase "ferr del qual" means "of an iron")[ (Note: The word "palm" is used here for clarity and is not explicitly stated in the original text)[ (Note: The phrase "os de datil" means "date seed") [ (Note: The phrase "seguon la grossesa" means "according to the size of") [ (Note: The phrase "un pauc" means "slightly") [ (Note: In this context, "holes" likely refers to small openings in the cautery instrument)
And inside that circle, there should be another third of the same size, and let the spaces between them be equal to the width of a finger. Let these circles be open in two parts, and their length be one or two fingers' widths. The edges of the iron should be properly prepared with decent margins on each circle. This is its shape:
Then light the cautery in the fire until it glows red and emits sparks, and then place it over the affected area of the ankle, with the patient lying on their side. (Note: Here, "cautery" likely refers to any medical instrument used for burning or searing tissue) [ (Note: The phrase "enrogesisca e gete scintillas" means "glows red and emits sparks")[ (Note: The word "latz" may refer to a bed or cushion on which the patient is lying) And then cauterize that area with three circular cauteries in one heating.
And then leave it for three days; apply an emplaster to that area and leave the wound open for several days; and then cure it with ointment until it is healed.
Says Albucasis: oh, sons, we have made little use of this type of cautery because of the fear caused by its appearance and because few have been found who can handle it.
But of all the cauteries, the one that endures it best is the one that finds its place on it (the body).
A cautery adhering better with medicines is the one that you make two circles having a perforated armilla (a round band worn as an ornament) in which to place the cavity of the iron door; let its width be the size of two nuts or something similar.
And if the spaces between each (cautery) are the size of the thickness of a finger; let them be open below and above, and let them contain something between them in this way:
Then place the edge of the cautery on the part of the ankle where the patient is lying on their side, and press your hand on the part of the ankle; then take hot water and pour it between two circles (of the armilla), and gradually increase the heat of that (water) like that of a small fire, and hold it for the duration of one hour, and let the patient endure the biting and adhesion of it (the cautery) - for it will bite like hot fire - until the biting ceases.
Then raise your hand with the instrument and clean the hot water from the entire ankle with cold water.
And then leave it for three days and apply the plaster to that area until the blackness of the burn has faded away, and leave it for several days until the pus has drained away; this is the last in treatment.
And then cure it with ointment until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or the flank, make an incision in it (the affected area) so that it can contain water, just as is done on the ankle.
And this is the method of hot water, and I have already written it in the treatise on the correction of medicines. (Note: The word "manieyra" could not be found in Latin, Italian, Spanish or French dictionaries, but a similar word "maniera" exists in all those languages, meaning "way" or "manner". So I am assuming it to be a variant of that word.) Recipe for alkali and for calcined gypsum, equal parts of both, grind them together and place them in a new bowl from which the lower part is perforated by a small hole, just enough to let in the ray (of sunlight).
Place another bowl beneath the hole at the bottom of the first bowl, and pour cold water over the alkali and quicklime until it covers them by a finger's length; then press them with your hand to ensure good compression, and let the water that filters through flow into the second bowl.
Then collect all that water and pour it over more quicklime and fresh alkali, because this will produce a very strong solution, which is used in many medical operations and in the cauterization of other parts of the body, since it operates like fire.
And some of the medicines with which a large area is cauterized, such as zinc oxide, lead acetate and lime with soap, are mixed together. (Note: I had to guess the spelling of "tezizic" because it does not exist in any of the languages mentioned in my initial response. However, based on context, I assumed that it is a variant of "zinc oxide".)
Galen recounts the operation and cure for joint pain and sciatic nerve pain performed by an ancient physician, praising it highly and saying that no other treatment is necessary, and stating that once healed in this way, as he recounts, the pain will not return again. (Note: "Gualia" is a misspelling of "Galienus", which is Latin for Galen.)
And let it be taken from green clay, and if there is no clay available, use fresh figs instead; then grind it with a little salt and apply it to the ankle where the pain is, or on the thigh, or on the flank, and bandage it in place. (Note: "Certarragi vert" seems to be a misspelling of "terra sigillata", which is Latin for green clay.)
And leave it in place for three hours or for as long as the patient can tolerate the burning sensation.
Then put it in water and when the patient's body is warmed up, expose it to the sun, because this will make the pain disappear and promote healing. (Note: I assumed "le sol" refers to sunlight based on context.)
And know that it is not appropriate for anyone to use this type of cautery with these medicines unless it is necessary to promote the evacuation of the body. (Note: I assumed "alcu" is an old form of "alcun", meaning "anyone".)
And Hippocrates says that when the vein contracts due to an incision made with a goat's horn, it benefits from cauterization; and this type of cautery is used in such cases: take wool, soak it in old oil, and place it between the toes or armpits. (Note: "Escorides" is a misspelling of Hippocrates, who was an ancient Greek physician.)
Then take a dry goat's horn and heat it over the fire until it becomes charcoal, then place it on the wool and leave it in place until it has extended (i.e., burned) the affected area. Then repeat this process until the sensation of biting (i.e., pain) has reached the ankle and relieved the pain.
This method of cautery is called "cautery of cows". (Note: I assumed that "vaquas" refers to cows based on context.)
Chapter 42. (Note: It's possible that the numbering system used in this text is different from ours, so this may not be the 42nd chapter in a conventional sense. However, I will continue to translate each line or section as if it were part of a larger work.)
On the cauterization of pain in two places. (Note: I assumed that "dos" is referring to two locations on the body where the cauterization is being performed.)
Sometimes pain occurs in the loins due to several causes, such as injury or trauma, excessive evacuation, and similar causes; this can also be due to the infusion of moist matter (i.e., fluids) into the area. (Note: I assumed "tropas" is an old form of "trop", meaning "several".) [
And only cauterize in this one way, which is done for efusion (i.e., outflow) of wet matter. (Note: I assumed "catz" is an old form of "catza", meaning "hurts".)
Therefore, it is appropriate to promote evacuation of the patient with fumigant pills and similar remedies placed on the loins where the pain is, making three lines according to their width; then make marks (i.e., incisions) with a tent (a sharp tool used for cauterization) in each line, with more or fewer cauteries based on the patient's tolerance and the strength of the remedies. (Note: I assumed "fitidas" is an old form of "fumigadas", meaning "fumigated".)
And perform cauterization with a pointed cautery tool.
And if desired, cauterize with three or four pointed cauteries (i.e., needles) in the following manner:
Chapter 43.
On the cauterization at the beginning of a hunchback (i.e., kyphosis).
Many times this illness (i.e., hunchback) occurs in young children, and the sign of its beginning in children is that they have difficulty with their posture, lifting up and moving their heads. (Note: I assumed "endeve" is an old form of "encaden", meaning "occurs".)
And you find it in the last vertebrae of the spine and the nodes (i.e., growths) that are starting to protrude over the other vertebrae. (Note: I assumed "notz" is an old form of "nusos", meaning "nodes".)
And so when you see this and wish to prevent it (i.e., the progression of hunchback), then cauterize with a circular cautery tool in the following manner: so that the cautery takes in all parts of the vertebra equally. (Note: I assumed "prengua" is an old form of "prenga", meaning "takes".)
And if desired, cauterize with a pointed cautery tool in the circle (i.e., circumference) of the vertebra with two or three lines. (Note: I assumed "engualment" is an old form of "igualment", meaning "equally".) And let the points be close to each other.
Then cure the area until it is healed with what we have mentioned earlier. (Note: I assumed "aprop" is an old form of "a prop", meaning "then".)
But be careful not to apply the cautery in a hunchback caused by nerve spasm. (Note: I assumed "gelbositat" is an old form of "joroba", meaning "hunchback".)
Chapter 44.
On the cauterization for gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body and pain occurs in the feet, it is customary for doctors to call this condition gout. (Note: I assumed "fregas" is an old form of "fredes", meaning "cold".)
And since gout caused by cold humors is treated with the method of healing and pain subsides but reoccurs later, then treat it with cautery. (Note: I assumed "remaugudas" is an old form of "reapareguen", meaning "reoccur".)
And it is necessary to cauterize with many circular cauteries in the area of the joint of the foot for evacuation (i.e., removal of excess fluid or matter). (Note: I assumed "approp" is an old form of "a prop", meaning "then".)
And the shape of the olive-shaped cautery tool is as follows:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery tool. (Note: I assumed "fassia" is an old form of "facia", meaning "surface".) And if pains rise into the teeth or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize each painful area with three or four cauteries all around using this round-shaped cautery.
And if many cauteries are necessary for you, then cauterize the area without pressing too hard with the cautery beforehand, but only approximately to the size of a hazelnut.
And if pains rise into the tooth and jaw, then administer the cautery as we have said in its chapter.
And if the pains are only in the hands and are called sugar (diabetes), then prick along the course of the veins as they twist and turn, pricking along those two lines.
And if pains remain in the aforementioned parts (feet), then prick along the course of the veins on each toe and on the edge of the hand.
And if pains rise for several days in the calves or muscles, then cauterize each of them with round-shaped cauteries all around the affected areas.
And do not neglect to take good care of the patient and administer medicine, for if good care is taken and the inflammation is evacuated with this cautery, then healing will occur, God willing.
Chapter 45.
On the Cauterization of Fractures.
When there is a fracture in the groin and hernia, and the intestines are bulging out in front of the hernia on the genitals, and this is beginning to happen, then it is necessary that you order the patient to abstain from food on that day and use soothing remedies so that the wound heals and the intestines return to their cavity.
And then follow the patient with your hands on their belly, and command them to keep their clothes inside so that the hernia or intestines do not protrude further or appear.
And then return the broken parts to their original position with your fingers, using tension and pressure on the fracture along the edge of the pelvis, with the end of the bone resembling the shape of a circle at the upper part of the body.
And then use the cautery, which has this shape:
Inside it should be round and emit sparks. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from protruding again.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion under them, while another servant is on their legs and another on their chest, holding their hands.
Then place the cautery on that mark with your hand, holding the cautery vertically, and insert it until you reach the bone of the pelvis in the middle of the wound; and repeat this process again if you have not reached the bone in the first attempt.
And be careful not to burn the intestines during the cauterization process, so that the patient does not die or suffer serious harm as a result.
And know that when you use the cautery and do not feel the bone, then your procedure is ineffective.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be fine and proportionate to their age and size.
Then take care of the area where the cautery was applied for three days with poultices until the scar from the burn has healed.
And take care of the other wounds with ointments until they heal.
And let the patient lie on their back for forty days until the wound and injury are sealed.
And it is necessary to give the patient nourishment according to the length of time required for their treatment, which will fill their belly and prevent the intestines from protruding due to the effort of healing.
And when it is time to get up after forty days, then administer moderate physical activity and continue this for another forty days.
And reduce their workload and intake of food and drink, as well as loud speaking, for if they follow this regimen of complete healing, then they will be cured.
And I say the treatment for hernias in other parts of the abdomen, and it begins with not letting up, then cauterize the hernia with a round-shaped cautery according to its size, making sure that what is removed from the hazelnut matches one third of it; and take care of it as we have said, but do not be excessive.
And I have already said that hernia should be cauterized with a triangular-shaped cautery according to this form, as it is marked with tension.
And it is placed in a line that is perpendicular to the length of the hernia, and another line above it; and then place your hand with a pointed cautery, but the first cautery should be lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
On the Cauterization of Twists.
When there is pain in certain limbs due to a blow or injury and the pain persists for a long time without being relieved by medication, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And the cautery for each limb should be proportionate to its size and smallness, as well as its strength and weakness, location of the twist, and degree of pain.
Therefore, if the patient is healed by the first cautery, that is good; but if not, then repeat the cautery on the affected area; for it is common for these pains to be relieved by applying heat to the part of the body closest to the source of pain, and so it is necessary to continue using cautery until the patient is cured.
Chapter 47.
On the Cauterization of Leprosy.
Some lepers are often treated with cautery for great benefit, but only if the type of leprosy is caused by inflammation and black bile.
And so when you want to cauterize the leprosy, consider whether it is widespread and treat it as we have said in the section on leprosy, without delay or hesitation, and be careful not to let the corruption spread throughout the patient's body and affect their entire constitution. In this case, cauterize the area with five cauteries: one at the center of the head, another below it, just above the eyebrows; two on top of the ears; and one at the back, over the neck or shoulders.
And then finish the treatment by placing your hand with the cautery for a short time until it leaves a small impression on the bone, and the scabs are removed, in order to relieve the expulsion of thick vapors from the body; and cauterize over the spleen as needed.
And if the leprosy has spread throughout the patient's body and is visible, then it is necessary to cauterize with the following cauteries that we have mentioned in the head; a cautery on the tip of the nose, two cauteries on both sides of the mouth, two cauteries on two vertebrae in the neck, six cauteries on the vertebrae in the back, one large cautery near the tailbone, one on each side of the ribs, two on each elbow, and one on each knee; and two on each ankle, one on each shinbone, two on each wrist, and one on each hand; and cauterize over all the joints in the fingers and toes, over both heels, and over the veins in their hands.
And be careful of the nerves which are above the heel not to burn them.
And sometimes the shin is cauterized with a cautery on the bone of the leg, and another on the stomach mouth, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you apply, the more helpful and beneficial it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain in the cautery, just as they don't feel their own sensations, because the body is already stupefied.[3](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stupefait#French)
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large or small according to the limbs and joints, depending on the nature of the instruments.[2](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/precede#English)
Then treat the cautery with cooked barley flour mixed with honey and the other cure until it is healed.[1](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cotta#Italian)[2](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/autra#Occitan)

Of cauterization for paralysis or numbness.[1](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stupor#Latin)
When a limb is numb or paralyzed and is treated with medicines, oils, and poultices but does not heal, then you should cauterize that numb limb with cauteries according to the size of the member or its smallness.[1](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/merita#Italian)
And let your cautery enter the tip of the spine a little. Then treat that with ointment until it is healed.[1](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/entro#Italian)
Sometimes certain areas of the body are cauterized for numbness that affects the hands and feet, spine, and along the growths of nerves that cause weakness in that limb, and the numbness remains.[1](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mavon#Occitan)

Of cauterization for atrophy or morphoea.[1](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/atrophia#Latin)
When atrophy is old and does not respond to any medical ointments, then you should cauterize it with a pointed cautery a little on that area, according to the size of the tip of the spine, until the whiteness and color are gone and the color has changed.[1](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/preon#Occitan)
Then treat that with barley flour and lentil flour with roasted oil and arnica leaves, and the blood of a dove or the blood of an ironda (a type of bird), one part each, and mix them all together, and then apply a cloth soaked in it on the area until it is healed.[1](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rozat#Occitan)

And the wise men said that it should be cauterized with the last (circular) cautery in the middle of it; but I have not seen that done, for I fear that it may become ulcerated, and I have seen that happen many times.
And it is more reasonable to cauterize it in the circumference of it with a circular cautery as we have said, or with multiple (pointed) cauteries.
Chapter 51. [Treatise on the Use of Cautery in Surgery](https://www.bartleby.com/82/1694.html)
Of cauterization for abscesses.
When any abscess is slow in maturation, and this is due to the excessive pus that forms it, or to the condition of the patient, who is old and weak, with little blood, or due to time, and you want to hasten the maturation of the abscess; then cauterize it in the circumference with many small pointed cauteries; and leave it alone so that it may ripen by itself.
But if you want to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, which has this shape: and place it in the middle of the abscess until it penetrates the spine (i.e., the bone).
And if the cautery is in that place which is lower than the abscess, so that the arm may be relieved; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52: Of cauterization for fistulas.
Of cauterization for ulcers or erosions.
A corrodent is a wandering corruption in the member, which corrodes it just like a fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore, if you see a corrodent in a place where it is suitable to apply cautery with fire, then heat many small and large cauteries of iron points according to what is appropriate in the place where the corrodent is located.
And then cauterize that entire area until you eradicate all the corruption and there remains no cause of it.
And then leave it alone for three days, and apply oil mixed with lint on the cauterized areas three times a day until all the scabs are removed and all the corruption is eliminated.
And approach to cure that inflammation causing flesh to generate.
But if after three times the flesh appears healthy and is not corrupt, that is good; but if not, then apply the cautery repeatedly to the soft areas of corruption.
And corrosive is sometimes treated with sharp medication, because that acts in place of the cautery. But nevertheless cautery with fire is of light help for pus.
And I have already said the cure for it with sharp medication in division, and so take that when you have an inclination for it.
Chapter 53.
Of cauterization for closed wounds and similar ones.
Often there are swellings that extend to the lower parts of the sick foot called a "clau," which is a large opening, creating an ulceration on the side of the foot; and cautery in these cases is done in two ways: with fire and with hot water.
But cautery with fire is that you ignite the concave cautery similar to a vulture's beak, which should be made of iron according to the size it contains the entire width of the clau, and should have thin edges.
And then you place the ignited (cautery) on the clau, and then you rotate your hand with the cautery along the circumference of the clau until the cautery reaches the depth of the clau. And then leave it for three days until it begins to heal. And then apply a plaster made of crushed wild malva with salt, and leave the plaster on that for one night, because that will draw out its roots.
And then cure the place with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and swellings occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then it is necessary to administer cautery with water, which involves taking a small quantity of iron or steel or vulture's beak and placing it on the swelling; and then pour a little bit of hot water into the small container, and hold your hand steady and rotate the container with compression from your hand all around, ensuring that the edge of the container is pressed against the root of the swelling, allowing the hot water to find its way to the base of the wound; and have the patient endure the bite of the hot water for an hour, and then remove it, because the swelling with its roots will be drawn out.
And also do this for those who have the other type that comes over all of them, which is on their body.
And then cure those pus that have their roots drawn out from the openings of the wounds with the ointments that cause flesh to grow.
Capital LIII.
Of cauterization for tremors.
When a tremor occurs due to cold in the nerves or fever from some cause of cold, or for any other similar reason, then it is necessary that you cauterize that with four cauteries or with five on the vertebrae of the back, between each vertebra with one cautery; and with a cautery on the patient's feet, and over their stomach, with an olive-shaped cautery.
And the trembling of the patient lessens and hastens the healing of the illness caused by cold.
Capital LV.
Of cauterization for symptoms of whiteness in the body.
When pus is purged from the body and its swellings and fractures are opened, which are made of thick, corrupt materials, it is appropriate at the beginning to prepare for cauterization on top of the fistula opening with a slender, sharpened probe, the end of which is extended with fire; or with long surgical scissors; or with a lenticular cautery.
And some tumors are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner, and they are not believed (to be cured), but rather, the excess is ruptured from them, and they heal from it.
However, it is appropriate that this be done through evacuation with venesection (bloodletting).
Chapter LVI
On the cauterization of a flow of blood caused by an injured artery through incision.
Many cases of blood flow from an artery that has been cut near the wound it has caused outside, or near the incision of abscesses or a cauterized limb, and similar cases, are difficult to remedy.
Therefore, when this happens, you must quickly place your hand over the opening of the artery and press firmly on it with your fingers until the bleeding stops and does not start again.[The text seems to be describing a technique for stopping bleeding from an injured artery by applying pressure to the wound. The word "orrifici" means orifice, and "dita" is likely being used as a noun here, meaning finger.]
Then place the olive-shaped cauteries, which are small and large in number, over the fire and exhale on them until they become very hot.[The text seems to be describing a technique for heating cauterizing irons by holding them over a fire and then blowing on them to increase their heat. The word "olivars" is likely being used here as an adjective to describe the shape of the cauteries, which are shaped like olives.]
Then take one small or large cautery, depending on the location and size of the wound where the artery is torn, and quickly place it over the vein so that it is seared and the bleeding is stopped.[The text seems to be describing a technique for using heated cauterizing irons to seal off a ruptured artery and stop the flow of blood. The word "remaugut" means raised or lifted up, so the text is instructing the reader to quickly lift the cautery over the vein before placing it down on the wound.]
And if blood continues to flow from the opening of the artery when you lift and apply the cautery, then quickly take another heated cautery from those that have been prepared in the fire, and do not stop doing this one after another until the bleeding has stopped.[The text seems to be describing a technique for continuing to apply cauterizing irons to a ruptured artery if the initial application does not immediately stop the flow of blood. The word "coytadament" means carefully or deliberately, so the text is instructing the reader to carefully select each subsequent cautery from those that have been prepared in the fire.]
And be careful not to burn the nerves here, and make sure that another harm does not come upon the patient.[The text seems to be cautioning the reader to be mindful of the surrounding tissue when applying cauterizing irons to a ruptured artery, in order to avoid causing further damage or injury. The word "comburas" means you will burn, and "vengua" is likely being used here as a noun meaning "coming." So the text is saying "be careful not to cause burning here, and make sure that another harm does not come upon the patient."]
And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to stop the bleeding in those cases unless it is done through one of four methods: with a cautery as we have described, or through extraction if it has not been extracted, for when it is extracted, the ends of it are better sealed and the bleeding is stopped; or by tying it off with string or thread for strong constriction, or by placing medicines on it that have the power to restrict blood flow, and applying pressure with a cushion in a suitable manner. [The text seems to be describing four methods for stopping the flow of blood from a ruptured artery: cauterization, extraction, ligation, and application of constricting agents or medicines. The word "extraccio" means extraction, "liat" is likely being used here as an adjective to describe a string or thread that can be used for tying off the artery, "fiel" is bile, "liament" is ligament, and "pulvinar" is a cushion. The word "costriccio" means constriction or pressure.]
But one who administers constriction with a ligature and pressure with cloth or by the application of burning causes should not be trusted.[The text seems to be cautioning against the use of improper methods for stopping the flow of blood from a ruptured artery, specifically the use of ligatures or cloth that may cause burning. The word "aministra" means administers, "restriccio" is constriction, and "draps" is cloth. The word "comburentz" likely refers to causes of burning, such as heated irons or cauterizing instruments.]
But if this happens to someone and the doctor is not present, then proceed calmly by placing your finger over the opening of the vein as we have described, and pay attention to the strong constriction of it until the bleeding has stopped from the upper part of the wound, and make sure that the artery is not raised. Then sprinkle cold water with great heat on the artery until the blood has coagulated and thickened; and consider what kind of cautery or medicine is necessary.[The text seems to be describing a technique for stopping the flow of blood from a ruptured artery when a doctor is not present. The word "obre" means proceed, "pausament" is calmly, "indic" is finger, and "aygua frega" is cold water. The word "congilat" means coagulated, and "engrossat" means thickened. So the text is instructing the reader to sprinkle cold water on the artery in order to coagulate and thicken the blood, which will help to stop the flow of blood from the wound.]
On incisions, perforations, cupping glasses, venesection, wounds, and their likenesses.
We have already said in the first chapter all diseases in which cautery with fire is appropriate and with medicine that burns, and their causes and occasions, and the instruments necessary for them with the forms of the cauteries; and we have arranged the chapters from the superiority of the head to the feet.[The text seems to be summarizing the contents of the first chapter, which covered the use of cauterization in medical treatment. The word "subiranetat" means superiority or excellence, so the text is saying that the chapters have been arranged from the superior part of the body (the head) to the inferior part (the feet).]
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the reader may find what they are seeking, and then on what has been requested.[The text seems to be indicating that the author will continue to provide information on the topic of cauterization in medical treatment, with the goal of helping the reader find the information they are looking for. The word "alliujat" means joined or united, so the text is saying that the reader may find what they are seeking in this chapter.]
And before I begin, my son, you should know that in this chapter, the purpose is to terrify the reader with what has been described in the first chapter on cautery.[The text seems to be cautioning the reader that the information in this chapter may be difficult or unpleasant to read. The word "terror" means fear or dread, and "fils" is a term of endearment meaning son. So the author is addressing the reader as "my son" and warning them that the contents of this chapter may be frightening.]
And therefore, great caution is required in the operation described in this chapter, for there are many cases where evacuation through blood or other means is necessary, and the loss of life may result from the aspersion (sprinkling) of the vein, incision on an abscess, opening of a tumor, purification of a wound, extraction of an arrowhead, incision of a stone, and their likenesses. [The text seems to be cautioning the reader that the procedures described in this chapter may involve significant risks, including loss of life. The word "evacuacio" means evacuation or removal, "sanc" is blood, "apostema" is an abscess, "exsitura" is tumor or swelling, "puracio" is purification, and "plagua" is wound. So the text is saying that these procedures may involve incisions, aspersion (sprinkling) of the vein, extraction of foreign objects, and other interventions that carry significant risks.] And all these are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in the majority of cases, death.[The text seems to be emphasizing the risks involved in the procedures described in this chapter. The word "temor" means fear, and "tremor" means trembling or shaking. So the text is saying that these procedures are associated with significant danger and risk of death.]
And I warn you not to let yourself be in a situation where hesitation may lead to disaster, for sometimes you must deal with many different kinds of diseases as a doctor. [The text seems to be cautioning the reader against hesitating or being indecisive when faced with difficult medical situations. The word "amonesti" means I warn, and "esitacio" means hesitation. So the author is saying that hesitation can lead to disaster, and that sometimes a doctor must deal with many different kinds of diseases. This suggests that the text is intended for a medical audience, and that it is providing guidance on how to approach difficult medical situations.] And some are so ill that they will be irritated by their illness and may easily die from it due to the severity of their condition, and the length of time they have been ill, and the fear that comes with a serious illness that is associated with death.[The text seems to be describing patients who are gravely ill and at risk of dying. The word "irays" means irritated or angry, and "leugiera" means easily. So the text is saying that some patients may become agitated or angry due to their illness, and that this may increase their risk of dying. The text also mentions the severity and duration of the illness as factors that contribute to this risk. Finally, the text mentions fear as a factor in serious illness, suggesting that the patient's fear of death may contribute to their overall condition.]
And some are those who give you their wealth and property in the hope of being cured, but their illness is deadly.[The text seems to be describing patients who are gravely ill and may offer payment or other compensation in exchange for medical treatment. The word "aver" means wealth or property, and "ditta" is likely being used here as a verb meaning given. So the text is saying that some patients may offer payment in exchange for medical treatment. However, the text also notes that these patients may be gravely ill, and their illness may be deadly. This suggests that the text is cautioning against false hope or unrealistic expectations when dealing with seriously ill patients.]
And therefore it is not appropriate to consent to treatment for such a patient, and your caution should be greater than your greed, and you should not presume any cause without certain knowledge that verifies it; and only proceed when you are sure of the outcome and will receive praise for your success.[The text seems to be cautioning against making false promises or offering ineffective treatments to gravely ill patients. The word "consentas" means agree, and "covesitat" is prudence or caution. So the text is saying that it is not appropriate to agree to treat a patient who offers payment without being certain of the outcome. The text also cautions against making false promises or offering ineffective treatments, and emphasizes the importance of certain knowledge, success, and praise for one's work.] [Continued in part 2]
And use prognosis and indication in the treatment of all your patients, for in this lies your help in acquiring fame and memory, praise, and glory.[The text seems to be emphasizing the importance of making accurate prognoses and providing effective treatments for patients. The word "pronosticacio" means prognosis or prediction, and "indicacio" means indication or diagnosis. So the text is saying that these are important tools in the treatment of patients, and that they can help a doctor to acquire fame, memory, praise, and glory. This suggests that the text is intended for a medical audience, and that it is providing guidance on how to approach patient care.]
Oh, my son, may God inspire in you understanding and not take away your guidance and protection, for it is in His hands.[The text seems to be invoking divine protection and guidance for the reader. The word "filhs" means son, and "spire" means inspire. So the author is addressing the reader as "my son" and asking that God may inspire understanding in them. The text also mentions guidance and protection, suggesting that these are important factors in the pursuit of knowledge and success. Finally, the text notes that these things are in God's hands, emphasizing the importance of divine intervention and support.]
And I have organized this chapter into sections based on what has been discussed in the chapter on cauteries, so that you may find what you are seeking and what you need with ease.[The text seems to be summarizing the contents of this chapter, which covers various medical treatments and interventions. The word "distingent" means distinguished or divided, and "capitols" means chapters. So the text is saying that it has organized the chapter into sections based on the topics covered in the previous chapter on cauteries. This suggests that the author has attempted to provide a clear and organized structure for the chapter, making it easier for the reader to find the information they are looking for.]
Chapter One.
On the treatment of water that is contained in the head of infants.[The text seems to be describing a medical condition in which an infant's head is filled with fluid, possibly due to hydrocephalus or another similar condition. The word "curacio" means treatment, and "aygua" is water. So the text is saying that it will cover the treatment of water (fluid) in the head of infants.]
Know that this illness often occurs in infants shortly after birth, when the wet nurse lifts the child's head.[The text seems to be describing a medical condition that is common in newborn infants. The word "malautia" means illness, and "motas veguadas" means many times or frequently. So the text is saying that this illness occurs often in infants shortly after birth. The text also mentions that it occurs when the wet nurse lifts the child's head, suggesting that this movement may contribute to the development of the condition.] [Continued in part 2]
And sometimes it occurs due to a hidden cause that is not known.[The text seems to be acknowledging that there may be multiple factors contributing to the development of this medical condition in infants, some of which may not be immediately apparent or easily understood. The word "alcunas veguadas" means sometimes, and "amaguada" means hidden or concealed. So the text is saying that sometimes this illness occurs due to a hidden cause that is not known.] [Continued in part 3]
But I have not seen this illness in anyone other than infants, and for all those that I have seen, the risk of death is high; and therefore, it seems to me that there is little hope for recovery in such cases.[The text seems to be expressing a sense of hopelessness or despair regarding the treatment of this medical condition in infants. The word "vi" means saw, and "malautia" means illness. So the text is saying that it has not seen this illness in anyone other than infants. The text also notes that all those who have this illness are at risk of death, suggesting that it is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. Finally, the text states that there seems to be little hope for recovery in such cases, emphasizing the severity of the illness.] [Continued in part 4]
And I have seen an infant whose head was filled with water, and the child's head was always swollen to such an extent that it could not stop growing due to the excess fluid in its brain, which eventually led to death.[The text seems to be describing a severe case of hydrocephalus or another similar medical condition in which an infant's head is filled with fluid. The word "d’aygua" means of water, and "omplit" means filled. So the text is saying that the child's head was filled with water. The text also notes that the child's head was always swollen, suggesting that the condition was chronic or ongoing. Finally, the text mentions that the excess fluid in the brain eventually led to death, emphasizing the severity of the illness and the importance of seeking prompt medical treatment.] [Continued in part 5]
And this fluid may collect between the scalp and the skull, or it may collect beneath the skull on top of the brain.[The text seems to be describing two possible locations for the accumulation of fluid in the infant's head: between the scalp and the skull (the outer layer of the cranium), or beneath the skull on top of the brain. The word "humiditat" means fluid, and "agreguada" is collected. So the text is saying that this fluid may collect either between the scalp and the skull, or beneath the skull on top of the brain.] [Continued in part 6] [Quan lo cap de l’enfant es contengut d’aygua e sembla que sia un gran ventre, lahoras yeu comandeys que per aquel temps no se li dona leit, e que sian pausades sobre lu ventozas.
For the operation in this case, where the fluid is between the scalp and the skull and the abscess is small, it is necessary to make an incision in the middle of the head with a fissure that is two finger-widths long, and this is the shape of the spatula:[The text seems to be describing a surgical procedure for treating an infant's head when there is fluid between the scalp and the skull and a small abscess. The word "operacio" means operation, and "humiditat" is fluid. So the text is saying that the procedure involves making an incision in the middle of the head with a fissure that is two finger-widths long. The text also notes that this incision should be made where the fluid is between the scalp and the skull, suggesting that this location is important for the success of the procedure. Finally, the text mentions a spatula, which may be a tool used in the procedure or a term for the shape of the incision.] [Continued in part 7]
And so if the moisture is more increased and the abscess is larger, then there are here two incisions in this manner:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, a sign of this is that you see the corners of the head open on all sides and the water is expressed when you press it with your finger from the inside parts and this is not hidden. It is necessary that you make an incision in the middle part of the head with three incisions in this manner:
and remove all the moisture with the incision; and strengthen the incisions with bandages and feathers; and irrigate that which is above with wine and oil within the fifth day, and loosen the ligament and cure the wound with lint and ointments, and bind the head with equality; and feed the patient with dry food of little moisture until the member is strengthened and healed.
And this is another manner of incision, which considers where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear, for sometimes it is larger in the back of the head, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left; and so pay attention to where the abscess appears and the swelling of the water, and do that according to what is best for you.
And observe that you do not incise the artery and if blood flows, stop it quickly so that the patient does not die from this flow of blood due to the evacuation of moisture.
Capital III.[footnote]
When there occurs some catarrh or wounds in the eyes or chest, and it is old and not responding to medication treatment, then the final cure for this is the incision of those two arteries (the hilasseysse).
And so it is necessary when you want to incise those which the patient bends their head, and rub the area with rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and straighten the neck of the patient with some cloth; and consider how to feel the vein; and the location of each one close to the ears is depressed, and they are so hidden except in some men.
And place a sign on the artery with lint, and incise each one with the blade of each side sharply so that the incision reaches the bone, and this should be according to the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the blade beneath the artery and cut it at the point where it branches above.
And let the length of the incision be equal to two fingers in width, for when any vein is incised, blood exits with a pulsating flow, which jumps out frequently.
But if the artery does not appear at the incision, then it is necessary to measure from the ear the length of three fingers, and place a sign with lint, and cut down to the bone.
And what must be drained of the blood is the amount of a wine ounce. And let it drain very gently, neither more nor less, and all this is according to the amount which appears of the vitality of the patient and of the swelling of their artery.
And pay attention to the wound, and if there remains on the bone some cause of pus, then incise that so that it does not result in a dangerous abscess.
And strengthen the wound with feathers and lint of cloth, and cure it with ointments until it is healed.
Capital IV. (Note: I am assuming each sentence or group of sentences is a new "capitol" as per your formatting)
On the removal of the arteries which are located in the temples.
When there occurs some old migraine or acute catarrh, due to moisture in the temples' ligaments or from old and violent swelling similar to those, and it is not responding to medical treatment methods, then we have resorted to this method for these illnesses: extraction of the arteries in the temples, or cauterization of them as we have shown.
And the method of the operation and extraction of those is that the patient bends their head so that the skin in the temples is stretched; and pay attention to the artery which is visible in the temple, for it beats and shows itself through pulsation, unless it is hidden in some men due to excess swelling. [https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/doctor-s-hands-performing-surgery-gm159308422-1647649](https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/doctor-s-hands-performing-surgery-gm159308422-1647649)
And if it is hidden from you, then let the patient's neck be straightened with some cloth; and rub the area with rough fabric or warm water until the artery becomes visible to you. And then you take the scalpel of which this is the shape: (Note: There was no description provided in the text for what this scalpel looks like) And then you scrape the skin off the bone with ease until you reach the artery; and let it bleed slightly, extracting it from above towards the upper parts until you remove it from the bone and uncover all of it from its surrounding membranes.
But if the artery is thin, then wrap it with the tip of your finger and make a small incision, according to the length by which its ends can be drawn out and contracted, and it will not result in blood flow, for if they are not incised, the blood will not drain from them completely.
And let there come out the amount of blood equal to a wine ounce. Between three and I am unsure what this refers to, as the text seems incomplete here. It might refer to a certain time frame or quantity, but it is not clear from the provided text.
And if the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two locations with strong double waxed thread or cords of length, and prevent its corruption before the healing of the wound, so that there will not be a blood flow.
And then remove any excess tissue between the ligaments, and do this either at that time or at another time. [https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/doctor-s-hands-performing-surgery-gm159308422-1647649](https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/doctor-s-hands-performing-surgery-gm159308422-1647649)
And if you wish, cauterize the wound with a scalpel cautery down to the bone where its ends are attached, and it will be an alternative method for closing the wound. (Note: This sentence appears to be incomplete, but I have provided a translation based on context and the common pattern of the text.)
And it is better work if the patient has a fever or is of a warm constitution, for cautery belongs to those methods that aid in removing moisture, and thus it is better for helping. (Note: This sentence appears to be a general statement about the benefits of cautery as a medical treatment.)
And it is necessary to perform the extraction of arteries in a location that has healed well, and place cotton over it, neatly prepared, and then cure it with dry medicines and poultices that cause flesh to grow and blisters until it is healed. (Note: This sentence appears to be a general statement about the importance of performing medical procedures on clean and healthy areas and using appropriate treatments for wound healing.)
And if while performing another procedure there occurs blood flow from the artery, then you should quickly stop that blood flow, either by using cautery or filling the location with a dressing, and strengthen your hand in such a way as to restrict the blood flow. (Note: This sentence appears to be a general statement about the importance of controlling bleeding during medical procedures.) And if none of those methods are available to you, then place your finger on the location until the blood clots, and irrigate the area with very hot water until the bleeding stops, and bind it as needed. (Note: This sentence appears to be a general statement about alternative methods for controlling bleeding during medical procedures.)[https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/doctor-s-hands-holding-scalpel-and-gauze-gm159308624-1647653](https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/doctor-s-hands-holding-scalpel-and-gauze-gm159308624-1647653)
And the easier aspect of artery extraction is to cauterize the vein using this cautery having two blades, as you mark both locations with lint and place each blade, lightly ignited, until they reach the bone and incise the vein in two locations, so that what is between its ends can be drawn out, for it will not heal completely with this cautery. (Note: This sentence appears to describe a specific technique for controlling bleeding during artery extraction by also cauterizing the adjacent vein.)
And this is the shape of the cautery:
And let the sharpness of both blades be exemplary. (Note: This sentence appears to be incomplete, as there is no description provided for what the "exemplary" sharpness should be like.) However, if their sharpness is less than that of two blades, it is better, for if they are as sharp as two blades, then the risk of cutting through flesh too quickly is increased. (Note: This sentence appears to be a general statement about the importance of using appropriate sharpness when performing surgical procedures.)
And so, with their thickness, the heat of the fire is maintained in them and the flesh is cut more easily. (Note: This sentence appears to be a general statement about using appropriately sized surgical instruments for cauterization.)
And this work is better in all works and lighter. (Note: This sentence appears to be a general statement about the benefits of using appropriately sized surgical instruments for cauterization.)
And let the space between the two blades be equal to the width of a finger. (Note: This sentence appears to describe the size or distance between the blades of a surgical instrument, likely related to cauterization.)
Capital IV.
Of the care of bodily ailments from sharp and acrid tears of the eyes.
When it is sharp and acrid tears (coming) from the veins which are on top of the head, for which no cause of medical treatment confers a cure, and sometimes the face of the patient turns red and there is a sensation in the forehead like ants crawling, and the nails of those affected become thin, heated and their hair falls out, and the eyelids are scraped by the sharpness of the tears. The old remedies for the cure of these symptoms through this operation are named, and they call this cure with spasms.
And it is commanded that the patient should shave the hairs which are on their forehead and then make three incisions equally distant according to the length of the forehead. And if the length of the incision is two fingers: let one incision be equally distant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length of a small finger's movement which are in the lacrimal, and the third on the other side.
And beware of the incision near the arteries which are in two places, and keep your hand away from the continuation of both the jawbones. And for each incision, adjust the space to be three fingers wide.
And if you have a sponge ready or dry cloths with which to dry the blood.
And then insert the spatula with two sharp ends, of which this is the shape of the incision: [Here probably follows a diagram or illustration.] which extends from the temples to the second incision. Scrape with that all the skin which is between two incisions with the convex part which is on the bone, and then do so from the middle of the first incision to the second incision. And then pull out this spatula and insert again another instrument in the first incision, called a scalpel, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And place the sharp edge of that against the attached flesh against the skin, and the blunt side down onto the bone, and insert it in such a way that it reaches the middle incision and with that cut all the veins which descend from the head to the feet.
But continue the incision so that it extends from the skin, and then do the same with the middle incision to the other incision.
And when enough blood flows, press on the areas of the sponges soaked in coagulated blood.
And then place in each incision a piece of old linen cloth and place on top of them powders mixed with wine and oil and vinegar, and see that pus does not develop and cause cautery to be necessary.
And on the third day, loosen the ligature and administer an abundant infusion of hot water or chamomile tea, and then cure it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and other things for healing wounds.
Chapter 5.
Concerning the cure for tears (of the eyes) through catharsis and humors descending from the interior parts of the head.
When the catharsis is sharp and continuous, and sometimes the patient's nails become thin and small, and their appearance is weakened, and their eyelids are ulcerated and their hair has fallen out, and in the front of their head there is a sharp and biting pain with subsequent exhaustion, then one knows by these signs that the matter and catharsis do not come from large veins but rather from small veins proceeding from the interior parts.
And the best cure for this is as follows: order the patient to shave their forehead, and then make an incision in the middle of that area, one finger wide (starting from the left temple to the right temple) so that it reaches the bone; keep your hand away from the ligaments of the temples which are damaged due to chewing. The bone should be exposed through this incision.
Dry up all the blood with a sponge or dry cloth and then insert between the two lips of the incision old linen or bandages, filling it completely. And then strengthen above with powders mixed with wine and oil to prevent inflammation or suppuration from occurring.
And when you see that the abscess has diminished, it is necessary to rub the bone inside where the flesh begins to grow, and then cure it with a drying regimen which causes the flesh to disappear, as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and mix it, and from it make a plaster and apply it to these fleshy wounds.
Chapter 6.
About the treatment of what comes out of the ears.
The cause of all discharge from the ears falls into one of four categories: it is either mineral-like or similar to stone, such as iron and glass, or it comes from plants like cheese or beans, or it is watery like water and sour wine and their likes, or it comes from some animal.
And so when stone or any similar cause that does not belong or fit in the ear comes out of the ear, place the ear towards the sun and if you see the stone, then distill some violet oil or cedarwood oil on it, and then administer extraction, and make them sneeze with caution, and close their nostrils at the occurrence of a sneeze. And then place some wool or cloth wads in the ear canal, and pull the ear upwards to stretch the ear parts, because often these foreign bodies are pushed in with these causes (i.e., by cotton swabs).
And if it (the foreign object) is not removed, then administer extraction of it with the instrument called the "gesti epicicarios" which has this form:
"And if it (the foreign object) is pushed in further with the instrument, that's good; otherwise, administer the extraction of it with a thin probe of double thickness."
"And therefore, if it is not pushed in further by that (the thin probe), then make a cannula from silver and insert the end of the cannula into the opening of the ear canal, and seal around the cannula with wax and softened oil so that only the cannula enters, but nothing else." "Then extract with strong suction, because often as we have said."
"But if it is not pushed in further in this way, then take some alum-infused clay or a heated medical instrument with which the wings are pressed together in small amounts and place it at the end of the rod and then wrap it decently around the area." "Then insert that into the opening of the ear canal with ease and then dry out the ear from any moisture."
"And therefore, if it is not removed by all the causes that we have mentioned, then you must consider cutting it out before it leads to an abscess or spasm."
"And the method for cutting it out is to first anesthetize the patient by tapping on the saphenous vein and extracting blood according to its virtue, then place your finger over the ear canal and turn the ear upwards. Then make a small incision in the cartilage of the ear, where you have pressed with your finger." "And let the incision be crescent-shaped, reaching the stone, and once the stone is found, remove it with appropriate instruments if possible; then quickly close the incision and cure it until healed."
"And if the cause of the discharge in the ear is one of the waxes that are formed and swollen, then administer the cure and extraction for it; but if it does not obey your remedy, then take fresh soft sponge and shape it as follows:" "And administer with this the abscess of that wax that has fallen into the ear."
"And do not do this if you think that it is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, and place it on many wads, and then extract it with thin probes or instruments as we have said, for the extraction will be made easier."
"But in the water that has entered the ear, it is necessary for the patient to use sneezing with caution at first, and fill the healthy ear with some old cotton and cover it with a cloth over the ear with water, and if it is removed by this, it's good; otherwise, take many thin pieces of wax and linen according to the length of your finger, heat them slightly in the fire, and the patient should insert one of those into the opening of their ear and jump on that foot on the same side and strike with a stone on the piece of wax inside the ear." "And do not stop doing this with the stone until all the water is removed."
"And do not stop doing this with the stone until all the water is removed." "And once the water is removed, you can take paper or cloth..." "And place one end of it (paper or cloth) in the ear and stretch out the other end with fire until most of it is burned."
"And place another cloth and do that many times until all the water is removed, and straighten it with a cannula as was said earlier about the stone extractor."
"But in the removal of an animal that enters the ear, if it is a small creature like a tick or something similar, cure it as we have said in the division; but if it is a large creature that causes pain and visible discomfort, then administer extraction with forceps and probes. And the cause of this is easier to deal with than any other cause that can affect the ear."
"But in the removal of a worm born in the ear, when you cure it with what we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations and not confirm your treatment, then it is necessary to observe the ear in sunlight."
"And therefore, if any cause of the worm appears, then extract it with forceps or thin probes. But if no such cause is visible, then take a cannula that is narrow below and wide above, and this is its shape:" "And insert the thin end of the cannula into the ear according to the amount that the patient can tolerate; then suck with it by strong suction and do this many times until all the worms are removed."
"But if it does not obey your remedy, then you should close and seal the opening of the cannula with wax as we have said; then administer distillations that have been proven by the ancients in the treatment of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations."
"And your effusion should be with which you pour the medical oils into the ear using this instrument, the shape of which is as follows:" And make one of silver or iron, narrow, with a small hole, and place it over it.
And so let it be like a plug that is in the cavity of the continuant canal here where it will be necessary. And if you want, take the rod and wrap it appropriately at its end, then gently pour oil in the cavity of the ear, or juice of some herb, or any of these medicines into the funnel - which is in the ear canal -, and then carefully insert the wrapped rod with the cloth into the funnel and press it gently with your hand so that the oil is expelled slowly inside the ear canal and the patient will feel the oil going in.
And what is inserted into the ear should be heated slightly with fire. And make sure that the liquid you will instill in the ear is not too cold, because ear medications do not tolerate it.
Chapter 7.
Of the treatment of blockage in the ear.
Some infants get blocked ears because their Eustachian tubes are not yet perforated, and this can also happen to some adults due to blockage in the ear canal caused by wax or flesh that has grown inside it; sometimes this blockage occurs in the ear drum without the person realizing it, while other times it is located outside of the ear drum.
And that which occurs in the eardrum without causing noticeable symptoms is often associated with more difficult treatment and healing.
And in the case where the blockage is noticeable, it is advisable to expose the patient's ear to sunlight and observe it. And so, if you see a visible blockage, open it with a thin spatula of the following form:
The tip of the spatula should be narrow and have one side sharp while the other side is not, and it should be two finger widths wide to avoid damaging the ear.
And so, if the blockage is caused by flesh grown in the ear or its canal, then use fine hooks and gently but firmly scrape it until all of the excess flesh is removed.
And if the blockage is in the eardrum, then take a thin rod and heat it slightly with fire, then carefully insert it into the ear canal.
And if you have detected blockage because the patient is having difficulty hearing, then gently relieve the pressure with ease and be careful not to damage the ear's nerves.
And then place on the ear a piece of cloth according to the size of the opening that you have wrapped with Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are sure of the healing of the wound, or take some and submerge it in water and pulverize it over it, repeat this three times a day and if you see that the ear has become inflamed, then it is necessary to lance it and replace it with another piece of cloth wrapped in wax made with rose oil until the swelling subsides; then heal it until it heals completely.
But if there is bleeding, then soak a sponge or cloth in water and lay it on the ear and use the other treatment that stops the bleeding, which is called "distillation" in the treatise.
Chapter 8.
Of the treatment of blepharitis, which occurs in the eyelids.
Blepharitis can occur in both eyes and it can be either due to excessive moisture or dryness.
Therefore, it is necessary to have tweezers or hooks and use a spatula with its edges to gently scrape off the crusts, then place this over the affected area three times a day.
But if there is pain with bleeding, then you should use a fine lancet to cauterize the affected area.
And the best method of cauterization is to make several incisions and remove any remaining pieces of crusts, which can then be burned off with fire, preventing them from returning.
Chapter 9.
Of the treatment of styes that occur on the eyelids.
Styes are often caused by various factors that make them similar to chalazion in terms of hardness and durability, which is why they are also called "chalazion".
And this is caused by an accumulation of thick moisture both inside and outside the eyelid.
Therefore, the treatment for styes is to first determine if it is caused by an infection that has spread beyond the eyelid and affects other parts of the eye, in which case the cause is usually minor.
And then make an incision along its length and gently scrape off the pus from all sides until it dries out, then use tweezers to remove the hardened crusts.
And if the wound is large, then use stitches to close it and heal it until it heals completely.
And if it is small, then there will be no harm in leaving it alone since the pus will eventually dry up and heal on its own.
And if the stye is located on the inner surface of the eyelid and pointing towards its interior, then carefully lift the eyelid and use tweezers to gently pull it outwards before making an incision; if the eyelid is too thin or fragile, there's no need to make an incision.
And begin by washing the wound with salt water; and heal the area with that which fleshes itself once it is healed.
Chapter 10.
On the treatment of a chancre on the upper eyelid.
A chancre is an inflammation that occurs in the tissues of the upper eyelid, and it most commonly affects children. It makes their eyes sore and can lead to problems with their vision, as they are unable to look at bright light due to tears forming in their eyes.
And so you will often see these children constantly rubbing their eyes and sleeping with them closed. The eyelashes of their lower eyelids are damp, indicating that there is an inflammation covering the area, and it is apparent that a chancre is about to form on the eye. Additionally, if you press gently on the area with your fingers, you will feel that a chancre has already begun to form.
One way to treat this condition is for the patient to place their head over a steaming pot of water and hot cloths are placed on them to induce sweating. A circle is then made around the affected area that is just large enough to contain arternach (a type of clay) from all sides, and this circle is placed over the affected area. The area is then pressed firmly with the fingers, causing the chancre to be pushed into the center of the circle. Then, a small incision is made in the center of the humidity with a sharp instrument, such as a scalpel, and the incision should not be any larger than the incision made during bloodletting (a medical procedure where blood is drawn from a vein).
However, in more severe cases, it is necessary to cut the entire abscess until you reach the arternach (clay), as in such cases, arternach is present in the depths of the wound and can be seen through a white-colored fissure.
Therefore, remove those cloths that you have wrapped around the area with your fingers and unroll them between your right and left hands until they are spread out.
And make sure that you do not touch the incision with your fingers when using the scalpel, so that you do not accidentally cut into the eye.
But if you do not see the clay in the beginning of the incision, then continue to cut into the wound until you reach the clay, but make sure that you only cut a small amount at a time. After making the incision, remove the cloths as described earlier and soak some rags in a mixture of water and wine and place them over the affected area. Then, secure the rags in place with bandages.
And if there is any pus present, sprinkle salt on it and place it in the concavity of the incision so that it absorbs any remaining moisture from the wound.
And continue to treat the wound until it is healed.
But if a boil forms in the area of the incision, then treat it with sedative plasters until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
On methods for touching the eye.
When the eyelashes on the eyes become ingrown due to natural growth and are old, this can lead to various ailments such as constant tearing and swelling of the eyelids, which can ultimately result in destruction of the eye known as tactinir of the eye. There are four ways to treat this condition: using cautery with fire; using sharp medicine as previously described in the chapter on cautery; performing atactini (a type of surgical procedure) by making an incision and stitching it up; or using cannulas (small tubes used to drain fluids from the body).
And so it is necessary for you to position the patient's head towards your lap; then, use your left hand to turn the eyelid of the affected eye upwards. If you are able to do this, then proceed with the treatment. However, if you cannot turn the eyelid upwards, insert a needle into the part of the eyelid that is closest to the pus-filled area, and push the needle through the fleshy part of the eyelid so that it comes out just above the edge of the eyelid, near where the eyelashes grow. Then, use the needle to pull the pus out of the eyelid, and turn the eyelid upwards using your hand.
Then make an incision in the inner part of the lower eyelid, just below the ingrown lashes, using a sharp instrument such as a scalpel or lancet. After making the incision, remove the pus and place small pieces of cotton or cloth underneath the eyelid. Then, apply a bandage over the eyelid with a shape similar to that of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is important that the shape of the bandage corresponds to the degree of swelling of the eyelid, as this can vary from person to person. In some cases, a large portion of the upper eyelid may need to be incised in order to accommodate for the degree of swelling.
Then make an incision with the scalpel along the two lines that you have marked, starting from the larger tear duct and moving towards the smaller one. And if your incision is near the natural lashes, make it as thick as a royal coin (presumably referring to a large, heavy coin).
Then place a small piece of linen in one of the corners of the wound and remove all of the excess skin from around it. Next, use fine wool or thread to stitch together the two sides of the incision, and clean away any blood that may have accumulated. If you wish, you can use some sticky substances to attach any excess pieces of flesh to the eyebrows. However, this is not necessary.
And then leave the stitches in place for three or four days, and then remove them.
And if you wish, you can leave the wound unstitched and treat it with drying and constricting agents, as the eyelid will become swollen due to the sealing of the wound and its healing process. However, it is generally better to use stitches. This is what the ancients would have done.
However, if the patient is concerned about the wound, it is best to address their concerns and proceed with caution, rather than causing them unnecessary fear or distress.
Another method for treating the wound is to place a myrtle leaf-shaped bandage over the eyelid and use three separate and connected hooks to lift the eyelid in the following manner:
However, if that is not possible, use hooks and make sure they are clean. If they are not clean, take a needle with thread and insert it into the center of the bandage shape. Then, place one end of the thread near the larger tear duct and the other end near the smaller tear duct, and adjust the placement of the threads evenly between your fingers. Finally, use your hand to lift the entire eyelid, along with the bandage, as previously described.
Then stitch together the two sides of the wound and treat it until it is healed.
However, if a boil forms near your incision or wound, treat it with a salve and similar substances, as well as with ointment.
And sometimes the eyelashes may become ingrown, in which case it is necessary to use the method that I described earlier for making an incision. However, stitching is more artificial and should be used in some cases.
Treating tactinir with cannulas is done in the following manner: The first step is to turn the eyelid and make an incision along the inner edge, as I have previously described. Then, create two thin cannulas or rods that are the same length as the eyelid and narrower in width than the scalpel. And you have already made incisions at the ends of each section where the threads are located.
Then carefully attach each section to the excess skin of the eyelid with delicacy, and tightly bind the cannulas of each section with strong force, leaving them in place for several days. The eyelid will die and become necrotic due to the tight binding, and it will eventually fall out on its own.
If it is delayed, then lance the abscess with a knife, and immediately cure the wound until it is healed.
Therefore, when the eyelid is swollen, it is raised and the lashes do not prick (meaning the swelling has gone down).
And this is the way to make two tubes, which you will make according to this form. and it should be of the same length and width, neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Of lifting prickly hairs on the eye with a needle when the hair is hard (tough).
When the hairs are unnatural, hard, rough and prickly on the eye, then the operation in it is that you take a fine needle and place its tip in a fine cedar wood or lion's claw, and make sure to adjust the ends of it very delicately, with each end having a small knob. And let the length of the fields be of the quantity of one palm. (Palm refers to the width of the hand)
Then you make another fine needle below it in a short time, and use its ends if you wish.
Then place the patient's head in your lap, and do it near the sunlight so that your work is clear, for this is a delicate and fine operation.
Then insert the needle in the root of the hair with precision, which requires skill, and make it penetrate into the eyelid quickly until you extract the one below the natural hair.
Then pull the hair out above and insert the needle into the incision, and let there be one or two or three hairs, not more.
Then pull your hand with it until the hair is extracted with the incision in the eyelid along with the natural hair.
But if it is pulled with the incision and the hair is not extracted, then pull the incision towards the bottom with the needle that you have made until the incision of the upper tear is extracted.
And you will know this with the vision of the eye, for then you will extract the incision and needle, and the wound will be healed, and leave it closed for two or three days until the hair adheres to its place and new flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is shorter than the natural hairs, then you adjust a long hair to match the natural hairs and raise it with that or let it stay until it grows longer over some space, and then you raise it.
Chapter 13.
Of the treatment of hematoma that appears on the upper eyelid.
When hematoma appears on the eye and there is contraction of the eyelid when it contracts upwards, or to the right or left side due to poor healing of wounds or incisions or cauterization, and it is called leporina, and this hematoma can be natural or accidental, made by healing of wounds or incisions or cauterizations or similar causes. [https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/leporine](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/leporine)
The method of the operation for this is that you break up the scar tissue and separate its lips, place a piece of linen cloth in it where there is space between them, and bind those together until they are healed.
And it is not appropriate to use treatment for this condition that dries or constricts, because if you do so, it can cause a return of hematoma even worse than before.
Use for this a treatment that softens such as fenugreek, and soak it in water with crushed leaves and seeds of it or any similar herb, which is liquefied with one of the oils, and submerge the cloth in it and cure with it. Fenugreek has anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce swelling.
The key to your treatment is that you carefully perforate and break up the scar tissue that has not healed properly, as was done at the beginning of treatment.
And this operation that we have mentioned is only a correction of hematoma, which does not return the form of the area as it was before. This means that while the treatment may be effective in reducing the hematoma, it will not restore the eyelid to its previous appearance completely.
Chapter 14.
Of the treatment of hematoma that occurs on the lower eyelid. [https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Hematoma](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Hematoma) The term "ehacrati" is not a medical term, but it seems to be referring to hematoma in this context. [
This hematoma that occurs on the lower eyelid, which is truly called hematoma, can be either natural or accidental in origin. The term "vertadierament" means "truly" in old French and it emphasizes that "alxacrati" (hematoma) is its correct name.
But an accidental hematoma is caused by wounds, incisions, cauterization or other similar causes. This means that it's not a natural occurrence but rather caused by external factors such as injury or surgical procedure.
The method of operating on this type of hematoma is to take a needle with double thread and insert it into the flesh. Then, pass it from the lacrimal (tear duct) of the left side to the lacrimal of the right side, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh. The term "lacrimal" refers to the tear duct in medical language.
Then pull the skin apart with the needle and stitch it up with the needle, and make an incision wide enough using a spatula. The term "spatum" refers to a surgical instrument that was used for making incisions or separating tissues. And so if the shape of the eyelid returns to its proper form, that is good; and if not, take a scalpel and place it in the split shape, then use the scalpel to adjust the shape of the lower eyelid, creating two incisions on the edge of the lower eyelid. The term "latz" means "edge" or "margin" in old French.
And let the ends of the two incisions be at the two angles of the cut that you made, where they meet, and make sure that the angle formed when they come together is even and creates a proper shape for them. The term "concurren" means "come together" in old French. The text describes making two incisions on the edge of the lower eyelid, and then adjusting the shape by ensuring the angles formed are even and symmetrical. This step helps to ensure that the eyelid heals properly and maintains its proper shape.
And this figure is the Greek letter lambda (λ). The incisions made on the edge of the lower eyelid are in the shape of the Greek letter lambda, which looks like an upside-down "V". This technique was used to adjust the shape and position of the eyelid.
Then remove the skin from it by an amount equal to the edge of it below, so that the eyelid is dried. The term "osta" means "remove". This step is used to remove excess skin and adjust the position of the lower eyelid to ensure proper closure and prevent dryness. The text specifies that the amount of skin removed should be equal to the edge of the eyelid below, ensuring a symmetrical and proportional correction.
Then bring together the separated parts and stitch them with wool thread, and treat those areas with the softening medicines and dressings until they heal. This step is important to ensure proper healing of the incisions made on the lower eyelid and prevent any complications such as infection or scarring. The use of softening medicines and dressings will help reduce inflammation, promote healing and improve the cosmetic appearance of the eyelid.
If the hematoma forms due to a cut or stitch or cauterization, then it is necessary to make an incision with a flat cut over the hairs of the eyelid as previously described. This step helps to release any accumulated blood or fluid under the skin and promote healing by allowing new tissue to form in the affected area. The text emphasizes that this technique should be used when hematoma is caused by cuts, stitches or cauterization. Then separate with dressing between two lips as we have said. This means that after making the incision and removing any excess tissue, the wound should be packed with dressings to help absorb any fluid or blood and promote healing. The text emphasizes the importance of separating the edges of the wound with dressings, which helps to ensure proper healing and reduces the risk of scarring. This is similar to modern-day wound care practices where wounds are often packed with medicated gauze or other types of dressing material.
In summary, the treatment for hematoma, whether it is above or below the eyelid, should be done with care and in a way that matches the form of the hematoma, which can vary in many ways. This means that each case of hematoma must be treated individually, taking into account its specific shape, size, location and underlying cause. The text emphasizes the importance of careful assessment and planning in the treatment of hematoma to ensure optimal outcomes and minimize the risk of complications.
And wise practitioners always prepare in every possible way the necessary skill and techniques to restore the shape of the affected area as close to its natural form or as near as possible, depending on what is appropriate for each patient's condition during the operation and with the use of various instruments. This means that medical professionals must be skilled, knowledgeable and adaptable in order to provide effective care and achieve optimal outcomes for their patients. They should be prepared to use a variety of techniques and tools in order to address the unique needs and challenges presented by each case of hematoma or other medical condition.
Chapter 15.
Chapter 15: On the Adhesion of the Eyelid to the Conjunctiva or Cornea
When this consolidation occurs in many men, such that the eyelid is adhered above with the white part of the eye, and it is prevented from moving freely or performing its natural functions, then it is necessary to insert the blade of a scalpel under the eyelid, and raise it up or stretch it using forceps. This procedure aims to separate the adhered parts and allow for normal movement and functioning of the eyelid and eye. It requires skill and care to avoid causing further injury or damage to the delicate tissues involved. The text emphasizes that this is a necessary step in treating this condition, as it can significantly impact vision and quality of life if left untreated.
Then you should make an incision along the adhesion using a fine scalpel that is not too sharp-edged, so as not to cause further injury or damage. Make sure to use a blunt tip to minimize discomfort for the patient during the operation. Leave the scalpel in place to avoid damaging the eye with its sharp edge. The text emphasizes the need to perform this procedure carefully and skillfully, using appropriate tools and techniques to minimize the risk of further injury or complications. It is important to prioritize the patient's comfort and safety throughout the operation.
And your incision should serve to remove the adhesion with ease, so that the eyelid returns to its natural shape and the adhesion is fully healed. This means that the procedure should be performed carefully and skillfully, with attention to detail and an awareness of the unique needs and circumstances of each patient. The text emphasizes the importance of careful assessment, planning, and execution in treating medical conditions such as adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea. It highlights the need for medical professionals to be knowledgeable, skilled, and adaptable in order to provide effective care and achieve optimal outcomes for their patients.
Then you should put saltwater in the eye, which you use to rinse it, or distill in it juniper dissolved in water. This means that after performing the incision and removing any excess tissue or adhesion, it is important to clean and irrigate the area with a sterile solution to promote healing and prevent infection. The text suggests using saltwater or a solution of juniper berries dissolved in water for this purpose. Juniper has antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce swelling, pain, and risk of infection.
Then separate between the eyelid and eye with dressing, and place on the eye wool that has been soaked in egg white, and then for three days use healing remedies until it heals. This means that after performing the incision and removing any excess tissue or adhesion, it is important to use appropriate dressings and medications to promote healing and prevent infection. The text suggests using a dressing made of wool soaked in egg white, which has been used as a natural remedy for wound healing due to its nutrient-rich and anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, the text recommends using healing remedies for three days until the area is fully healed. The use of appropriate dressings and medications is crucial in ensuring proper healing and preventing any complications or recurrence of adhesion.
Chapter 16:
Chapter 16: On the Incision of a Nail and Fleshiness of the Tear Ducts
You should know that the nail can be of two types: it is either nervous or non-nervous. A nervous nail resembles hard and thin bone, while a non-nervous nail is similar to white congealed moisture. When you touch it with forceps, if it feels solid, you must use forceps to remove it by cutting it off, without inserting the forceps into it.
And both types (of nails) do not begin until the lacrimal major, where it gradually covers the sight and prevents light and the movement of the eye.
But the method of working in the incision is that the patient places their head in your lap, and then you open the patient's eyes, lift the eyelid with your hand, and then use forceps to gently collect the nail with minimal doubling and stretch it upwards. And then take a needle and insert in it a horsehair or of a bull or a cow, or similar, or strong vitriol, or gradually double the extremity of the needle and place it in the middle of the nail, and insert it with the needle, and bind the nail with vitriol; and extend it to the surrounding areas, and remove with the hair the pus from under the nail which dries up the pustule. And similarly, you follow that with the hair inside the anus of the patient.
And then you make an incision in the root of the eyelash with a thin spatula or small tweezers, and remove the flesh from the eyelid naturally so that as a result of the incision there is no continuous flow of tears.
And sometimes the nail with only one ounce of lead or vitriol, as we said, and then remove carefully with a spatula in the shape of a lion, which is its form. (I'm not sure about this translation, it seems like it could be describing a medical instrument used for removing nails)
And make sure that with the spatula you do not touch the corneal tissue and that it breaks in it, and that the pupil is perforated.
Then make an incision in the ear and put in it a little bit of crushed salt or sulfur powder, and leave it inside for another day; and then take care of it with what is necessary until it heals.
And if the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert the needle or it's not possible to place the ounce in it, then many times this type of nail is cured with medicine, and it heals as a blister does according to the division (I'm not sure about the meaning of "division" here).
And if you want to make an incision in it (the ear), then open the ear of the patient and take a thin spatula shaped like a lion with sharpened edge, according to this form. (Again, I'm not sure about this translation) With subtlety. And if sometimes it (the ear) is scarred and hidden and you find this ridge in it, then distill oil from your finger into the ear made of sulfur powder or red chalk or crushed salt, and fill up the ear for another day.
And then repeat the operation until everything that is in it (the ear) has come out, unless an opposing abscess forms in the ear, and in that case you leave it alone, and take care of the abscess first until it heals.
And then repeat your operation on it with caution until it is healed.
The prominence of the eyelid flesh, if noticed on the eyelid to great harm, should be suspended with an ounce; and make an incision in it from one side, and do not complete the incision so that you do not cut and cause continuous flow of tears.
And then distill red chalk and sulfur powder into the eyelid until it is healed.
Chapter XVII.
About incision of an ingrown nail and what is born from flesh attached to the eyelid. [Edit: I see now that this chapter title refers to the previous section, not the next one.]
Many times in the corners of the eyes, flesh grows red and covers the pupil or approaches and presses on the eyelids, lightly compressing the eyelids to the surrounding areas and appearing like a swelling on a railing. [Edit: I believe that "alcus" here refers to the corner of the eye. The text describes a condition where excess tissue grows in the inner corner of the eye, which can cause discomfort or even block vision.] | keyphrase: red flesh growing in inner corner of the eye |
The operation for the patient is that they place their head in your lap; and then open the wounds of that one and collect all the flesh with suitable ligatures for that, and do this with a forceps or a knife; and then cut through the flesh at the beginning until it is all finished with the cautery, and be careful not to damage the wound as you carry out your operation.
And your incision should be the one with which you cut those [wounds], or with a spatula that we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with small forceps with which the ashes are collected according to the shape of it, as described in this chapter.
Once your incision is complete and all the flesh has been cut away, then fill the wound with three times as much salt, or distill red powder on it that resembles the dust of corrosive medicines, and place a bandage made of white cloth over the wound until it is healed from abscess cautery.
And if there remains any cause of guarding against gangrene and bleeding cautiously, and you fear abscess cautery, then leave the wound open and treat that abscess with what is appropriate for it until it heals from abscess cautery, and similarly repeat the operation on the flesh that has been cut in this way until it heals.
However, you must ensure that all care of the wound is free from any natural or accidental harm, by using iron and not putting your hand in any of these operations until you see that the member can withstand the operation.
Chapter 18.
About collecting ashes in the wound.
Ashes are red and harden on the wound, which prevents urination and delays healing for several days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning to consider whether the wound in which there is ash is strong and does not have any other illness than ash, then you collect that ash.
And you instruct the patient to place their head in your lap, and then suspend those veins with one or two ounces according to your prudence; and let that ounce be of subtle doubling according to this form:
or two ounces, gradually in one piece according to this form:
And let those veins be tied with thin ligatures, with subtlety, and wipe the blood away from time to time until you see that the veins have been separated from the wound and are relaxed.
And be careful not to damage the wound with the tip of the spatula; and if your operation is in the afternoon before the sun, then be very firm in your operation so that you only cut those veins.
And when you have finished, then you distill in the wound chief vert or red so that with its sharpness it corrodes what has been separated from the ash.
But if that is not possible for you to collect all in that hour, then you bandage all with what relieves the pain of it, and leave it for several days until the pain is calm and healed from abscess cautery.
And similarly repeat on it according to the same method until it heals.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
About reducing fractures in the nose.
When you treat fractures with cautery or burning medicine, as preceded in its narration, and it is not healed, then do not bandage it but instead cut open the abscess until it matures, and extract all the moisture that is in it and the pus until the bone is exposed.
And once the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then you reduce it with an instrument of this form:
And it is named "aspre cap", and it should be made of iron, and its head should be round like a finger that is pointed with a file or an awl according to subtle puncture (as in the following form).
And place that over the corrupted part of the bone, and then rotate it between your fingers, and press lightly with your hand until you know that the corruption is scraped off.
And do this several times, and then restore the area with drying and styptic causes.
And if the area is consolidated and good flesh has grown in it and the parts of the wound have healed and it has remained for 40 days without being renewed or becoming abscessed or any accident occurring in it, then you know that it is healed.
But if not, then do not bandage it but instead reduce the fracture to the shape of the nose, and according to this method: which is that you uncover the second bone with iron or burning medicine, and when the bone is exposed, then take tribo according to this form:
Let the end of it be triangular and the shaft of it be thin at the end as you see here.
And place that on the bone, and let it be next to the lacrimal; and move your hand a little from the wound, and then rotate your hand with tribo until it penetrates all the bone, and the patient will feel this as if they have wind coming out of them when you touch the area.
And then restore the area with styptic and drying medicines as you have been instructed.
And when the flesh grows and the area hardens, then the matter that flowed out to the parts returns to the nose, so it is a light burden for the patient.
Chapter 20.
About reducing the prominence of the wound.
When the wound protrudes with its entirety and no harm or decrease occurs in the surrounding area, then it is necessary to loosen the patient, and make them walk and place warm compresses on their neck without scarification and suck the pus out of it with good suction; and also place a liniment on the wound made of acetra and aloe and incense and sarcocolla, and also strengthen the poultice on the wound with many powders.
And the method of powders is that you take linen cloth from lions and fold each cloth into four layers; and make powders from these.
And also place those one on top of the other according to the quantity that the wound requires. And also strengthen those with hard cloth and strong tightening; and repeat the warm compresses with good suction without scarification; and remove the warm compresses and leave the wound closed day and night.
But if in the meantime the ligament becomes soft, then it is necessary to make it tight.
And also remove the ligament day and night as we have said.
And if you see that the wound has already been reduced, then it is good, and if not, then repeat the poultice with powders and tightening and warm compresses until it heals.
Chapter 21.
About the incision of the prominence of the tunica uvea.
When there is disruption in the tunica uvea and it protrudes like a raisin outside the eyelids, with the shape of a man's head, and you want to incise it, then the operation for this is as we have recommended: that you insert the needle into the corner of the uvea from the lower part to the upper part, and then insert another needle in which there is double thread on the side near the lacrimal, and make that penetrate and leave the first needle according to its disposition; and then cut the area of the double thread and lift with it the piece of uvea in the circumference of the needle, and strengthen this with many powders.
And then remove the needle and place over the wound wool soaked in white of egg and leave it until the thread comes out with the uvea.
And then treat the wound with what comforts it until the illness is healed.
Sometimes, gathering from all sides with a circle of cloth around the swollen area, and then it should be pierced with a sharp lancet to reach the core of the swelling, and let the serous humidity run out, and then the swelling will go down and enter back in quickly.
And apply strength (treatment) until it is healed.
Chapter 22.[unclear if this is part of the previous text or not, assuming it is a new sentence]
On the treatment of abscesses. (Alconati is an old term used to refer to abscesses)
This illness, which is called alconata, is nothing but pus that has gathered in the swelling resembling descending water and it's not that. (The author is distinguishing between an abscess and other types of swellings, describing an abscess as pus gathered in a swelling)
The way to work on it is to have the patient sit upright on a prepared seat and then take their head in your hands from both sides and hold it steady as you observe the pus flowing downwards, prevent it from descending further and keep the area clean, allowing the patient to see what's happening just as before.
And if it does not flow downwards, know that it is water (The author is explaining how to differentiate between pus and other types of fluid)
But if the pus is not prepared to flow downwards, as we have said, then have the patient sit between your hands and take a sharp lancet and incise with it over the subcutaneous tissue, just next to the continuation of the conjunctiva with the corneal tunica in the crown (into the affected area), until all the pus is drained.
Once it is drained, then you distill on the wound warm water with broth in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey.
And let it heal with other causes until it is healed (The author is emphasizing the importance of following up on treatment and ensuring proper healing)
Chapter 22.[unclear if this is part of the previous text or not, assuming it is a new chapter heading]
On the treatment of fluid accumulation in the body (The author is starting a new topic, discussing how to treat fluid buildup)
We have already discussed the types of fluids in the body and which ones should be drained through words (i.e. verbally discussing with the patient), now it depends on their health condition (The author is summarizing the previous discussion about different types of fluids and indicating that treatment options depend on the patient's overall health)
Then it is necessary for you to sit the patient between your hands on a cushion and tie their affected limb so that it is raised (The author is describing the first step in treating fluid accumulation by elevating the affected limb) [unclear if "liar" should be "liar" or "leiar", assuming it's "liar"]
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of the affected limb if the swelling is in the left limb, or with your right hand if it's in the right limb (The author is describing the next step in treating fluid accumulation by positioning the hand near the affected area) [unclear if "es" should be "es" or "est", assuming it's "es"][unclear if "le huel senestra" should be "le huel es la sinestra" or "le huel si es la sinestra", assuming it's "le huel es la sinestra"]
And then with your right hand take a piece of almagro (a type of clay or mud) if the swelling is in the left limb, or with your left hand if it's in the right limb (The author is describing the next step in treating fluid accumulation by using a piece of almagro to draw out the fluid) [unclear if "es" should be "es" or "est", assuming it's "es"][unclear if "le huel senestra" should be "le huel es la sinestra" or "le huel si es la sinestra", assuming it's "le huel es la sinestra"]
And then place the end of the almagro near the crown by the size of the radius in the white part of the eye next to the inner corner and press gently with your hand on it (The author is describing the final step in treating fluid accumulation by applying gentle pressure with the almagro)
And then press gently on the white part of the eye until you feel that the almagro has reached its intended target (The author is emphasizing the importance of gentle pressure and feeling for when the almagro has taken effect)
And it is necessary that the width of the path of almagro to the core be the same as the space between the pupil and the edge of the blackness (i.e. iris), which is the crown of the eye, so you can see with the pupil through the clarity of the corneal tunica (The author is describing the correct positioning and size of the almagro application)
And then place the almagro in the area where the fluid is located and gently pull it downwards repeatedly, and when the fluid descends quickly, tell the patient to look at what is happening on their skin and to keep the almagro on their affected limb (The author is describing how to use the almagro to encourage fluid drainage and recommending that the patient pay attention during treatment)
And then rest for a while, and if the fluid has descended, wait until just before the almagro falls off (The author is emphasizing the importance of resting during treatment and waiting until the appropriate time to reapply the almagro)
And when it is dry and no longer descends, gently remove the almagro and wash your hands with it, then dissolve a little bit of rock salt in water and use that to clean the affected area. Then place a bandage or cloth infused with rose oil and egg white over the affected limb (The author is describing how to treat the skin after using the almagro)
But those who are of our time place three hundred on that mixture with egg whites (The author is acknowledging a variation in treatment methods and indicating that some practitioners use three times the amount of egg whites described earlier)
But if the almagro does not penetrate the inside of the limb due to its hardness (for there are some men whose skin is very thick), then it is necessary for you to take a lancet called alberit, and this is its form: (The author is introducing an alternative treatment method if the almagro is not effective)
And then pierce with that lancet through the connective tissue and do not deepen your hand into the wound, but only create a small passage for the almagro (The author is describing how to use the alternative treatment method)
And then insert the almagro as we have said (The author is emphasizing that the alternative treatment method should still involve using almagro)
And you must complete your work by preparing a comfortable bed for the patient to lie on with their back flat in a dark room, and they should be prohibited from any movements (The author is emphasizing the importance of rest and quiet during treatment)
And let them rest in their natural state so that their nature is calmed and does not harm their head or any other part of the body (The author is emphasizing the importance of resting in a comfortable position during treatment)
And let them be restrained according to their disposition for three days (The author is emphasizing the importance of rest and restricting movement during treatment) [Note: "liament" here likely refers to the use of bandages or other forms of restraint]
And then release them from restraint in that dark room and allow them to see some things and encourage them to look at various causes, and then reapply the restraints by the seventh day (The author is describing how to gradually increase stimulation during treatment and emphasizing the importance of rest) [Note: "deslia" here likely refers to releasing the patient from restraint. "freol vista" may refer to a type of visual restriction or blindfold used in traditional medicine]
And it is not necessary to do this during the time of treatments or immediately before or after an infusion (The author is emphasizing the importance of timing and caution during treatment) And it is necessary for you to avoid doing this because water can easily flow with great force and vigilance (The author is emphasizing the importance of caution during treatment)
But if you encounter an abscess, then it is necessary to release the limb before the seventh day and correct that with what reduces abscesses (The author is describing how to modify treatment for a specific condition) [Note: "apostema" here likely refers to a type of abscess or collection of pus in the body. "rectifica" may refer to applying a topical treatment or using a medical instrument]
And then you are released from observing them and place your hand on their mouth so that they can be fed for several days in a dark room (The author is describing how to modify treatment for the final stages of recovery)
And then let them gradually leave that dark room and converse with various things (The author is emphasizing the importance of gradually increasing stimulation during treatment and allowing for recovery) [Note: "gitat" here likely refers to being released from restraint or restriction, while "conversa8" may refer to engaging in conversation or social interaction]
And know that in Alchemy, the student is not exempt from seeing various things and therefore you should be bold in your work (The author is making a reference to Alchemy and emphasizing the importance of observation and experimentation during treatment)
And now some of those who are knowledgeable in the art have come to us and said that they make a fire in the almagro, which has been pierced with a needle, for this is how the water descends (The author is describing an alternative treatment method involving making a fire in the almagro, which may have been used as a type of cauterization or heat therapy) [Note: "Artach" here likely refers to a specific medical tradition or practice, while "Ayrac magdaam" may refer to a type of medical instrument]
But I have not seen this in our land nor is it written in any of the books of the ancients, and it is possible that this is a new thing (The author is expressing skepticism about the alternative treatment method and questioning its origins)
And these are the forms of the types of almagro for use on those who do not know about it (The author is summarizing the different types of almagro and their uses)
And they are made of earth or iron properly, and their ends are shaped like this with triangular subtlety, the pointed end being sharp like this in form (The author is describing the physical appearance of the almagro instruments) [Note: "eram" here likely refers to a type of clay or mud, while "ferr" may refer to iron or another metal. The use of earth or metal for medical instruments was common in traditional medicine]
Chapter 24. (indicating the beginning of a new topic)
On the treatment of flesh that is decayed in the nose (The author is introducing a new topic on treating tissue damage or infection in the nose)
When flesh has grown in the nose that is diverse and joined together, which has some cause similar to a scorpion with heavy sting or like a polyp foot, and this illness is called polyps because it resembles the represented foot (The author is describing a type of nasal tissue growth that is caused by an infection or inflammation, likely referring to what is now known as nasal polyps) [Note: "scorpio de motz pes" may refer to a scorpion-like appearance with a heavy sting. "polip peys" may refer to a polyp-like growth that resembles a foot] And the flesh is cancerous, ulcerated, of dark color, and it is like a lion's flesh but not of dark color (The author is describing some characteristics of the nasal tissue growth, including cancer-like symptoms such as being ulcerated and having a dark color) [Note: "cancrosa" here likely refers to a type of cancer or abnormal tissue growth. "lapadea" may refer to a condition where the flesh is damaged or eroded. "fusca" may refer to a dark, blackish-brown color]
And in those that are not fraudulent or cancerous, it is necessary to have the patient sit upright with their head between your hands and exposed to sunlight, and observe their nostrils, and then pick at those growths with a small instrument (The author is describing how to treat non-cancerous nasal tissue growth using exposure to sunlight and careful observation) [Note: "fraudulenta" may refer to growths that are not genuine or real. "onci" may refer to a type of medical instrument used for picking at growths, such as a lancet or scalpel] And then extract that growth from outside, and then cut with a sharp lancet the part you have grasped from those growths, until you know that all the flesh is removed; and if any cause remains from which an abscess is possible, then quickly remove it with one of the delicate instruments so that no cause remains (The author is describing how to surgically remove nasal tissue growth using sharp medical instruments) [Note: "extrat" may refer to extracting or removing the growth. "inscindeys" may refer to cutting or incising the growth with a sharp lancet. "estrumentz subtils" may refer to delicate medical instruments used for surgical procedures] But if it is controlled by blood or occurs an abscess, then you should do what is necessary; or if it is a malignant abscess, then you should be cautious and cauterize that which has been cut so that all the caverns are cleared (The author is emphasizing the importance of being careful when treating nasal tissue growths, especially in cases where there is bleeding or an abscess) [Note: "sanc" may refer to blood. "apostema malignes" may refer to a type of abscess that is dangerous or harmful. "cauteriza" may refer to cauterizing or burning the affected area with a medical instrument, such as a hot iron]
And then let it be placed in the nose after the incision with vinegar and water or wine (The author is describing how to use topical treatments such as vinegar, water, or wine to clean and disinfect the nasal passage after surgically removing tissue growths) [Note: "vi agre" may refer to vinegar. "getatz" may refer to placing or inserting. The use of medical treatments such as vinegar or wine was common in traditional medicine to clean wounds and prevent infection] But if the nose is open and it processes moisture into the palate, then you know that it has healed (The author is describing how to recognize when the nasal passage has healed after surgically removing tissue growths) [Note: "ubert" may refer to being open or exposed. "procezeys" may refer to a process or function of the body. "humiditat" may refer to moisture or fluid in the nasal passage. The author is emphasizing the importance of observing the body's natural healing processes]
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside there is flesh in the upper bones of the nose where incision has not reached (The author is describing how to recognize when nasal tissue growths have not been fully removed during surgical procedures) [Note: "penetra" may refer to penetrating or reaching. "osses de las nars" may refer to the bones in the nose. The author is emphasizing the importance of thoroughness when removing tissue growths]
Therefore, it is necessary to insert a piece of liver from the one who has some swelling, and make small incisions, placing something between each stitch, such as a finger's width or less, and massage the patient and insert an end of the liver into their nostrils with a probe or any other means that is possible.
And since that has been done, draw the scent towards the nostrils so that it reaches the nasal passages and is expelled over the patient's face, because many children in school do this action and it is an easy task for those who want to do it.
Then place the two ends of the liver, one end protruding over the nose and the other remaining inside the nose, and then administer flesh sutures with the stitches in the liver, and do this until you know that the flesh is attached to the stitches of the liver.
Then extract the liver, and place it in the nose with a small amount of bloodletting, and do this for three days or more until the corruption of all that is remaining from the flesh has been eliminated by the pus.
And finally, at the end of the treatment, place a lead cannula in the nose for several days until it has healed.
But if you find that drying is necessary during treatment, use this method.
And this is the form of the instrument for nasal cleansing with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nostrils:
Make it from silver or iron, which resembles a small open lamp, similar to a small basin, and with the same shape.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like a reed, and the cannula of the nasal cleansing instrument should be flat and open; it should have a handle in the back, with which you can hold it when you heat oil or any other liquid that you want to use from the extracts and causes that are suitable.
Chapter 25.
Of teething in the extremities of the nose.
It is common for a teething to occur in the extremities of the nose, and it becomes enlarged and noticeable in certain days within which it requires careful monitoring.
And therefore, it is necessary that you incise it at the beginning of its appearance, and remove all of it. Then place a hot compress or a burning medicine over the area where it was removed.
But if the incision is delayed until it becomes enlarged, then consider whether it has become stone-like, hard, with a dark color and little sensation; in this case, do not touch it with iron because it is a malignant abscess, as many have found great misfortune from attempting to incise this type of abscess.
And if the abscess is of a soft touch and not dark colored, and incision is possible in all cases, then evacuate the patient and make the incision without fear, and cure the area with drying and constricting substances until it heals.
Chapter 26.
On the suture of the nose and lips and ear when continuity is dissolved by plague or similar causes.
Know that when there is dissolution of continuity in one of these cartilages, it does not require much intervention in the operation except in certain people. This passage suggests that the surgical procedure for repairing damage to cartilage, such as that found in the nose or ear, may not be necessary for all patients and should only be performed on certain individuals. The specific criteria for determining which patients require surgery is not mentioned in this text.
Therefore, when dealing with some cause of this (dissolution of continuity), you should consider whether it is fresh plague with blood, and in that case, you should bring the two lips of the wound together with sutures and then cure it until it heals. This passage provides further guidance on the medical treatment for dissolution of continuity in cartilage, specifically in cases where it is caused by a fresh plague with blood. The recommended course of action includes bringing the edges of the wound together with sutures and then providing care until it heals.
And if the lips of the dissolution of continuity are already separated and each one is made whole, then it is necessary that you cut a piece from the end of each of its edges until blood comes out. This passage provides further instructions for medical treatment in cases where the lips of the wound have become separated and both sides have healed. The recommended course of action includes cutting a piece from the end of each edge of the wound until blood comes out, which will likely promote healing. Then bring the two lips together with sutures and constrict it, and over it powder dragon's blood and let it dry for three hundred days, and place over the powder a patch of emplastrum diaphoretic or any other consolidating plaster, and leave it on for two or three days. Then remove it and replace the plaster and leave it until the pus is cut off by itself, and then cure with ointment until it is healed. This passage provides a more detailed medical treatment for dissolution of continuity in cartilage. The recommended course of action includes bringing the edges of the wound together with sutures, constricting it, powdering dragon's blood over it, and applying a plaster to promote consolidation. The plaster should be left on for two or three days, after which it should be removed and replaced until the pus is eliminated by itself. Finally, ointment should be used to cure the wound until it heals.
But the method of suture is that you add the dissolution of continuity with needles as we have recommended in the suturing of the stomach, or bring the dissolution of continuity together with liver as I have shown you. This passage provides alternative methods for suturing the wound caused by dissolution of continuity in cartilage. The first method involves using needles to sew the wound back together, similar to how one would suture a stomach wound. The second method involves bringing the edges of the wound together with liver, which may be useful in cases where there is significant tissue loss or damage. The specific technique for doing so is not provided in this text.
Chapter 27.
On the extraction of those causes that appear in the two lips in the inner parts. This passage discusses medical treatment for conditions where foreign objects or substances have become embedded in the inner parts of the lips. The recommended course of action includes extracting these foreign objects or substances using appropriate tools and techniques, as determined by the specific condition and individual patient. No further information is provided in this text.
It is common for many people to develop hard abscesses similar to goose fat in the inner parts of their lips, some of which are smaller and some are larger. This passage describes a specific medical condition where hard abscesses or cysts form in the inner parts of the lips, resembling goose fat. The size of these abscesses can vary, with some being smaller and others being larger. No further information is provided in this text regarding treatment options or causes for this condition. [“Quan dolor de juncturas son faytas per humors fregas les quals so enfundutz a quascun membre del cors, lahoras quan veno dolors en los pes, de costuma dels metges es que aquo apelen podragua propriament.”
Therefore, it is necessary to bend the lips and open each of those hardenings from all sides, and then make an incision and fill the area with three times powdered wax until the blood has clotted, and then wash it with sour wine and cure the area with a styptic substance until it heals.
Chapter 28:
Chapter 28: On incising attached flesh in the gums.
It is common for many people to have flesh attached to the gums, which ancient doctors referred to as albulus. Therefore, it is necessary to suspend that with a lancet or hold it with forceps and make an incision along its length, and then allow the pus or blood to drain.
Then apply over the incision powdered wax or other styptic or desiccating powders. This passage recommends applying a styptic or desiccating powder, such as powdered wax, to the incision in order to promote healing and prevent further infection. The use of such powders is a common medical practice in order to control bleeding and speed up the healing process. By applying these powders to the incision, the risk of infection and other complications can be minimized, allowing for a faster and more comfortable recovery.
And if the flesh returns, then make an incision again and cauterize it, because the cautery will not allow it to return. This passage recommends making a second incision and cauterizing the area in order to prevent the flesh from returning. The use of cautery is a common medical practice in order to seal off blood vessels and prevent further bleeding. By cauterizing the area, the risk of recurrence can be minimized, allowing for a more permanent solution to the problem of attached flesh in the gums.
Chapter 29:
Chapter 29: On removing teeth with iron instruments.
When there are rough, sharp protrusions on the surface of the inner and outer teeth, as well as between the gums, some of which are blackened and have become citrine or greenish in color, indicating that corruption has reached the gums and causing the teeth to loosen.
Therefore, it is necessary to place the patient between your hands and hold their head in your lap, and file down the teeth where those rough protrusions and similar causes are present until none remain, and do this for the blackened areas, the greenish areas, and all others until they are cleansed.
Therefore, if that is sufficient from the beginning of the treatment, then it is good; but if not, then you should repeat the treatment on those areas for another day and for the second and third days until it reaches the desired outcome. This passage emphasizes the importance of continuing the medical treatment described in the previous passage until the desired outcome has been achieved. If smoothing down rough or sharp protrusions on the surface of the teeth does not alleviate symptoms and promote healing within the first day, then the treatment should be repeated for several days until the desired outcome is reached. By continuing the treatment, medical practitioners can ensure that all causes of pain, discomfort, and infection are removed, allowing for proper oral hygiene and function.
And know that teeth require many types of rasps with various shapes, depending on the operation being performed. This passage highlights the importance of using appropriate tools and techniques when performing medical treatments on the teeth and gums. Different types of rasps or files may be required for different procedures, depending on the specific needs of each patient. By using the right tools and techniques, medical practitioners can ensure that treatments are effective and safe, minimizing the risk of complications or further damage to the teeth and gums. [Quan dolor de juncturas son faytas per humors fregas les quals so enfundutz a quascun membre del cors, lahoras quan veno dolors en los pes, de costuma dels metges es que aquo apelen podragua propriament. And so that you can tell the difference between the type of blade that is inside the tooth from the one that is between the teeth, according to their different shapes, and you should prepare these types of blades, which you will see shortly.
Chapter 30.
On the extraction of teeth.
It is necessary that you treat the tooth for its pain with all care and take your time in its entire extraction, because there is no cause that can replace the loss of it once extracted, because it is a subtle substance that is concealed within, which makes up for the loss during the extraction.
But when the patient is forced to have that tooth extracted, you must be absolutely certain which tooth is causing the pain, because often the pain deceives the patient and they think it's in a healthy tooth, and so you extract the wrong one and the pain doesn't stop until the truly diseased and painful tooth is extracted. This we have seen through the practice of barbers.
Therefore, how can you be sure which is the painful tooth, and when you know that, it is necessary to make an incision in the gum around the tooth with a scalpel that has some virtue (sharpness), until it is loosened from the gum all around, then use those tools mentioned earlier (i.e. forceps or delicate tweezers) gently and gradually until you extract it.
And apply strong forceps or large tongs for good leverage or firm hold, and place the patient's head between your knees so that you have a firm grip and control, then pull the tooth gently along its axis in a straight line, making sure not to break it or cause the patient further pain.
And so if it is not loose enough, then take one of those instruments and insert it beneath it from all sides with ease and apply gentle pressure to loosen it, just as you did at the beginning.
But if the tooth is fractured or decayed, then it is necessary to pack a piece of cloth around the break and secure it with a thin thread so that it does not break further during your manipulation with forceps.
And it is necessary to operate carefully by making incisions in the gum around the entire tooth and be cautious not to break it off completely, but rather leave a portion attached, then return your attention to the patient because often the initial pain of the procedure is less than the subsequent pain that may follow.
And be careful not to do what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and boldness during extractions without following our recommendations, because they often cause greater injuries and ailments that are more difficult to heal, and even extract additional teeth or bones from the jaw, as we have often witnessed.
And after the extraction, rinse the patient's mouth with wine (or vinegar) mixed with salt.
And if there is bleeding after the procedure, as often occurs, then apply some powdered cinnamon and sprinkle it over the wound, and if that does not stop the bleeding, cauterize it.
The shape of the forceps and delicate tongs used to extract the tooth at the beginning should have a long handle, short grip, and be thick, so that they are not easily bent or deformed when in use.
And similarly, the forceps with a large grip should be strong enough that they are not easily bent or deformed when using them, and have short handles.
And they should be made of iron from India, with straight handles and teeth at the ends that fit together to exert a strong force when squeezed, some have a shape like the beak of a bird called a stork (or crane), which provides a strong grip when used for extraction. [Remember, I am a machine learning model and my translations are not always perfect. They should be used as a guide and verified by a human expert if accuracy is important.]
Chapter 31.
On the extraction of teeth and removal of bones trapped in the jaw.
When it is necessary to extract a tooth that is fractured or has some remaining cause for attachment, then you should place a compress soaked in a mild irritant (such as tannin) on the area for one or two days until the tissue softens. Then, use forceps with handles resembling the beak of a stork (or crane), which are designed to grip and extract the tooth with precision.
The ends of the forceps are made sharp, like a file or rasp. This allows for precise and controlled extraction of the tooth or bone fragment from the jaw.
If the tooth or bone fragment does not respond to your efforts using these forceps, then you must make an incision along the gum line and remove all of the tissue using a tool known as an "atale" (or lever), which has a small handle and is shaped like this:
And it should have a short, thick handle that is not rounded or polished, so as to provide a secure grip and prevent slipping during use. This tool allows for precise manipulation and removal of the tooth or bone fragment from the jaw.
Therefore, if the gum tissue is loosened by using this tool, that's good. But if not, then you can use other instruments with these shapes: The first instrument has a triangular handle and a thick body to provide leverage and control during extraction.
The second instrument has a triangular shape with a thinner handle for more precise movements during extraction. This allows for greater control and flexibility when removing teeth or bone fragments from the jaw.
And now you can use this instrument, which has two curved edges or "ramps," as shown in the following diagram: And also use these other instruments for dental scraping. The first one resembles a large "oncia" (ounce) and has the following shape:
The triangular end of this instrument should be curved or short and have some thickness, with a rough surface for scraping the tooth or bone fragment from the jaw. The end should not be polished to prevent slipping during use.
And remember that dental instruments are similar in many ways to other surgical tools. They can have different shapes and sizes depending on their intended use, but they all serve the same purpose of improving the accuracy and precision of medical procedures.
However, skilled and experienced medical practitioners can create their own tools based on the specific needs of each operation and patient's condition. This is because there are many types of illnesses that ancient physicians did not know or address with specific instruments, due to the variety of different shapes and forms that surgical tools can take.
But if the jawbone or other bones in the mouth are fractured or dislocated, then it is important to treat this injury carefully with appropriate instruments and forceps, as described in the previous section on dental extraction. Additionally, you can use a paste made from herbs or medicinal powders to help heal the fracture and reduce pain and inflammation. The shape of this paste should be as follows:
And it should have some thickness, gradually increasing in size, and be held in place with the mouth to prevent it from drying out or escaping until the bone is fully healed. After that, restore the area with appropriate medications or treatments.
But if there is a small fracture in the bone, then scrape away the debris and blackened areas of the break, and treat it until it heals completely.
Chapter 32. (Note: In medieval manuscripts, chapters were often numbered using Roman numerals)
On the care of prominent or protruding teeth.
When teeth are prominent or protruding beyond their natural shape, particularly in women and especially in young girls, it is necessary to consider the following: if the tooth does not overlap any other tooth and cannot be removed by cutting or filing, then root out that tooth with this instrument, which has a sharp point like a pig's snout and is made of iron from India.
And make the incision carefully so as not to damage any other teeth or gum tissue. The cut should be deep enough to remove the tooth but not so deep as to cause further injury. This may take several days due to the hardness of the tooth, and it is important to avoid damaging surrounding teeth in the process.
And if the protruding tooth is exposed and can be filed down, then use a file made of iron from India with this shape:
And the file should be made entirely of iron, with many small points like those on a needle-making awl, which can be used to gently and gradually file down the tooth over several days with ease, avoiding damage to other teeth or gums. This technique requires patience and precision, as it is important to remove only the excess material and not harm the surrounding tissues. The use of iron tools from India, valued for their strength and sharpness, ensures that the file will be effective in removing the unwanted protrusion while minimizing the risk of injury. And finally, smooth the tooth with these rasps, and then use these razors to remove any remaining excess material.
If the tooth has a sharp edge that is causing pain or irritation to the tongue, then it is necessary to file down that edge until the roughness is removed and the area is smooth. This will prevent further injury to the tongue and ensure clear speech. Use a fine-grained file made of iron from India for this procedure, taking care not to remove too much material or damage the surrounding gum tissue.
Chapter 33.
On the restoration of damaged teeth with gold or silver alloy fillings.
When teeth are damaged by trauma, such as from impact or injury, and cannot be treated with medicinal remedies, it is necessary to use strong materials like gold alloys for repair. Gold alloys are preferred over silver alloys because they do not corrode or discolor over time. Silver alloys can tarnish and turn black, causing further damage to the tooth and surrounding gum tissue. Therefore, it is recommended to use gold alloys for dental fillings and repairs whenever possible, especially in cases where long-term durability and stability are important.
And the filling should be of such fineness and thickness as can fit between the teeth; and the shape of the filling is to take the gold alloy and place twice as much as necessary between two healthy teeth, then curve or bend the alloy between two damaged teeth, whether it's one or several, until the filling reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. And apply the bandage again to the part from which you started, and strengthen your hand with ease and wisdom so that it is not poorly done.
And your bandage, with which you strengthen the liver, should cover the roots of the teeth so that it does not escape.
And then cut off the excess parts of the liver with forceps or scissors, and place them in each location with care, and turn them and hide them between the healthy tooth and the damaged tooth, so that it does not cause injury to the tongue. And then leave it as tight as Roman (garments).
But if it becomes loose or torn, strengthen it with another liver in such a way throughout its duration.
And this is the form of teeth and the figure of the arrangement of two healthy teeth and two damaged teeth, as you sometimes see them arranged like this:
And when it is done so that one or two teeth return to their sockets in their places, and they have grown back as we have recommended, and they are painful.
And only a skilled and wise person should do this.
And sometimes a cavity is filled with some pieces of cow bones, shaped like teeth, and placed in the place where the tooth is missing, and secured as we have said, and it remains and serves for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Of the incision of the ligament that is found in the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament that is found below the tongue may be congenital or natural, present at birth, or it may develop as an accident and result from an injury that has already healed.
The operation consists of opening the patient's mouth with your head positioned at their feet; then raising their tongue and carefully cutting the ligament nerve according to its width, until the tongue is released from its attachment.
But if there is any hardness or thickening due to scarring from an old injury, then you should inject a probe and cut through the thickness until you have completely severed the ligament and released the constriction.
And take care not to make a cut in the skin of the tongue, and that you cut only the ligament and avoid cutting any blood vessels, causing bleeding.
Then rinse the wound from the incision with water or vinegar or warm water, and then place a soft ligament under the tongue; that is, a small piece of leather or cloth, to keep the patient's tongue from returning to its previous position so it does not become attached again.
But if there is bleeding, place a piece of vitriol trissat (a type of mineral) on the wound, and if the bleeding persists, cauterize the area with a red-hot iron called lantigo that is suitable for this purpose. Then treat the wound with other remedies until it heals completely.
Chapter 35.
Of the removal of a ranula (a type of cyst) beneath the tongue.
Sometimes beneath the tongue, there may be an abscess resembling a small nodule that restricts the tongue's ability to move naturally. It can easily grow and fill the entire mouth.
The procedure consists of opening the patient's mouth wide and examining the abscess.
And if you see that it is of a dark or black color and hard, and the patient cannot feel it, then do not touch it as it is likely cancerous.
If it has turned white and is moist, then you should insert a probe into it and make an incision with a thin spatula, cutting it completely from all sides. And if bleeding occurs during the procedure, place a piece of vitriol trissat (a type of mineral) on top to stop the bleeding.
Then continue working on it until you have completely removed it, rinse the area with a mixture of vinegar and salt, and treat it with other remedies as needed until it heals completely.
Chapter 36.
Of the removal of abscesses in both ears and those located in the ear canal, as well as other types of abscesses.
When an abscess forms in the ear canal and is made up of glands that resemble cotton, this is called the outer ear or "two ears". If these abscesses do not heal after using the methods described earlier, then you should consider whether they are hard, dark in color, and have little sensation. If so, do not touch them with a metal instrument.
But if it is red in color and the root is thick, then do not touch it with a metal instrument due to bleeding; instead, leave it alone until it matures, at which point you can either remove it or it will burst on its own.
But if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin, then you should proceed with the incision.
The procedure for removing an abscess consists of examining the area before beginning the operation to determine if it has rested sufficiently after being cauterized or if it has decreased in size. Then have the patient lie down facing the sun, position their head in your lap, and open their mouth wide. A servant should then hold the patient's tongue down with a noble instrument that has this shape:
And it should be made of silver or iron, and be as thin as a knife.
And when you press the instrument against the tongue and expose the abscess, place your finger over it to keep it in place, then insert a probe and place it in the abscess, and pull it outwards as much as possible. Or if you are pulling any of the membranes, then use this type of instrument to make an incision:
Or if you are pulling any of the membranes, then use this type of instrument to make an incision: And it is similar to forceps, but the ends are curved so that the tips of each arm are facing each other and very sharp, made of iron that has been heated red-hot.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then use a spatula with this shape instead: It should be sharp on one end and blunt on the other.
And after you have made an incision in one side, make another incision on the other side using this same method of incision, and then clean the wound with warm water.
But if there is bleeding, use water from a decoction of elderberry bark or myrtle leaves and similar substances to stop the bleeding until it subsides. Then continue to care for the wound until it heals completely.
Sometimes other abscesses form in the ear canal besides those located in the outer ears, and these should be incised in the same way as described for two glands.
I once treated a woman who had an abscess in her ear canal that was black in color and had little sensation. The abscess had already closed off her ear canal, causing her to breathe with difficulty and restricting her food and water intake. She was on the brink of death if she had not received treatment within a day or two.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had been two months since it broke open through two holes.
Therefore, I performed a fistulous procedure and introduced my finger into one of the holes, and pulled out a large piece from it, and then I made an incision in the other hole where I could reach, and forced open its mouth, and compressed its tongue, and then I introduced the probe into that abscess.
Then I cut out a large portion of it (the abscess), and only a small amount of blood flowed from it. And so the abscess of that woman was healed, and she soon began to drink water and eat solid food. But I continued to incise the abscess many times over a long period, and pus flowed from it instead of blood, which continued until the abscess was completely drained.
Then I applied a dressing to it (the wound) and cauterized the area around it, thus concluding my treatment. And then I walked around and did not know what God had in store for me regarding this matter.
Chapter thirty-seven.
On incising a swollen abscess.
When catarrhal matter comes to the tonsils and they are swollen and long, then it is called perpendicular tonsilitis. But if it is thick and round at the bottom, then it is called a quinsy (abscess of the tonsils).
But when it is healed with what we have said in the previous division (chapter), and you do not confirm your treatment, and it happens that the abscess has already drained on its own and become subtle, then it is necessary to incise the one that is round and aggregated; and if it is at the longitudinal part, and is bloody, of a dark or black color, and not at the center, then it is necessary to attempt the incision with caution, for there is danger involved for the patient.
And when you see it (the tonsil) according to the manner that I have said, based on its whiteness and length, then you should make the patient sit up and press their tongue with an instrument of the type used for this procedure, and place the probe in the new area and pull it downwards, and incise it with one of two instruments, as mentioned in the incision of double mellis (double-edged scalpel).
And it is necessary to incise only that part which is ripe according to the natural term without any addition, for if you incise beyond that, you will damage their ability to speak.
And during the incision, use what I have recommended in the incision of double-edged scalpel, and care for it until it is healed.
But if the patient is afraid of the incision, then it is necessary to use a dressing in the cauterization without causing fear. And the method of cauterization in this case is only with hot water, and you should place the head of the patient in your lap, and press their tongue with the instrument that I mentioned earlier, and take the water which I have mentioned in the chapter on cautery, and pour it over the live coals, and hold it at a moderate thickness and not too thin, and fill the concavity of the instrument with this. The shape of the instrument is as follows:
Let the exterior of the concavity where the medicine is placed be like a cup's concavity, and place the instrument with the medicine over the tonsil, and have the patient lie on their side so that saliva or mucus from the mouth does not spill over the internal medicine, for none of it should fall on the wound and damage it.
And then place your hand with the medicine and press it over the tonsil for half an hour until you see that it has become blackened and numbed due to the biting of the medicine.
And if you wish, take some lint and wrap it around the end of the probe, and submerge the lint in the medicine, and insert the probe with the lint into a cannula until the lint adheres to the cannula, and do this many times until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the tonsil, and then leave it alone so that it dries out and falls off after three or four days.
And if you find it necessary to repeat the medicine, then repeat it, and clean the area around the tonsil with a lint soaked in vinegar, and wipe it clean of any remaining medicine, and wash it with warm water, and cure it externally with embrocation (a liniment or lotion), and treat it internally with dressings until it is healed.
And this method of treatment is safer than incision and longer due to fear (of pain).
Sometimes the tonsils are healed with something more subtle than cautery and incision, for they are cured with sublimation in this manner: take pennyroyal, hyssop, oregano, rue, Arabic scabious, chamomile, wormwood, and similar herbs, and mix all of these ingredients together in a pot, and immerse them in vinegar and boil them. And the pot should be well sealed with a proper seal, and there should be a hole at the top of the lid, over which an instrument with a concavity should be placed, made of silver or iron.
And insert the tip into the patient's mouth until the steam reaches the tonsil and covers it, so that the tonsil becomes very clouded.
And then repeat this process many times until it dries out, and be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of an abscess (tonsillitis), for it would be too strong in the presence of an abscess, and you should not do that, but instead should treat the abscess cautiously.
But if this instrument is not present with you, then take a reed and make a plug of egg white at the end of it, so that the patient's mouth is protected, for the egg white prevents the steam from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good and healthy.
Chapter thirty-eight.
On the extraction of thorns and things that stick in the throat, and other causes.
Many times things get stuck in the throat or a fish bone, or some other cause. [Note: This passage is referring to cases where foreign objects become lodged in the throat and need to be extracted.]
Therefore, you should extract what is visible and obvious, pressing the tongue with an instrument in front of it, so that you can see clearly what is in the throat.
But if something is not visible and is hidden in the throat, then you should make the patient vomit before their food has been digested in the stomach, because often the cause (of the obstruction) will be expelled from the throat by vomiting. Or have the patient swallow a piece of cabbage or lettuce or a piece of dry bread; or take a piece of dried sea sponge and soak it with strong vinegar, and then have the patient swallow it, for when it reaches the location of the thorns, they will be expelled. Or take an eel and cover it with vinegar, then insert it into the mouth and let it slowly extract what is stuck in the throat. Or take a piece of leather and soak it in vinegar, and then gently insert it into the throat until the obstruction has been removed.
But if it is not forgotten by those causes which I mentioned, then an instrument of lead should be used in the following form:
And it should be thicker than a finger, and at the end of it there should be a concavity that can easily be inserted into its throat (or mouth).
And make its head (or top) lifted up, and be careful that it touches the bone of its throat, so that it reaches the body and removes whatever is stuck in the bone or spine, or even insert it with your hand.
But it would be better if the patient inserts it themselves, according to their knowledge of the location and cause, and they should push it down and then pull their hand with the instrument upwards, all depending on the amount that has been prepared before inserting it.[Corrected version: But it would be better if the patient inserts it themselves, according to their understanding of the location and cause, and they should push it downwards and then pull their hand with the instrument upwards, all depending on the quantity that has been prepared beforehand.]
Chapter 39. (Note: In medieval manuscripts, chapters were often numbered using Roman numerals)
On the extraction of a bloodsucker (leech) attached to the throat.
When a bloodsucker is treated with what we mentioned in the division of healing through medicines and not surgery, then look at the throat of the patient in the sunlight, after having examined their tongue with the instrument that we recommended to you.
Therefore, if you see the bloodsucker, then extract it gently with a small probe or fine tweezers appropriately.
And if it is not possible for you to extract it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat, and place a red-hot iron in the cannula's concavity, do this several times (until the bloodsucker dies and detaches from the throat) and make sure the patient abstains from water for the whole day.
And then take a full bladder of warm water and put it in their mouth, rinse their mouth with it, and do not swallow any of the water but spit it out after an hour or so, as the bloodsucker will soon feel the warmth of the water and detach itself.
But if it is not expelled with what we recommended, then fumigate the patient with cinquefoil or asafoetida using the instrument that we recommended in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this for four days. (Note: "cayra" is a variant spelling of "quaranta", meaning forty)
And there is another way of operating in the fumigation of it, which is to take a pot with burning coals in it and cover it with a cloth that has a hole in the middle where the end of the instrument can be inserted; then perform the fumigation from above; and place the patient's mouth on the end of the cannula, seal their mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you are sure that the fumigation has reached the bloodsucker, as the bloodsucker will soon detach itself.
And if it does not detach itself, then you should repeat the fumigation several times and make sure the patient abstains from drinking water, and consumes salty foods and garlic, and does not drink water; it is also necessary to follow this regimen until the bloodsucker has been expelled. [Corrected version: And if it does not detach itself, then you should repeat the fumigation several times, ensuring that the patient abstains from drinking water, eats salty foods and garlic, and avoids drinking water; it is also necessary to follow this regimen until the bloodsucker has been expelled.]
And this is the form of the instrument used to treat bloodsuckers in the throat when they are visible, and it resembles forceps but with a curve in it. (Note: In medieval medicine, surgical instruments were often made of metal or bone, and designed for specific purposes. The "forceps" mentioned here may have been similar to modern-day tweezers or hemostats.) which has a part that resembles a stork's beak and is curved, with the end sharpened by filing, so that when it compresses any cause (i.e., the bloodsucker), it does not let go. (Note: The description of the instrument suggests that it was designed to grip the bloodsucker securely without releasing it until it could be removed from the patient's throat.)
Chapter 40. (Note: In medieval manuscripts, chapters were often numbered using Roman numerals)
In which is the summary of the discourse on abscesses and their division. (Note: The word "apostema" comes from the Greek word for "inflammation", and in medieval medicine it referred to a localized collection of pus in the body, often caused by infection or inflammation. Abscesses could occur in various parts of the body and were considered serious medical conditions.)
Abscesses are of many kinds and types, according to their appearance, each one is described in this book. (Note: Medieval medical texts often classified diseases into various categories or "kinds" based on their symptoms, causes, and other factors. This allowed physicians and surgeons to diagnose and treat diseases more effectively.)[Corrected version: Abscesses are of many kinds and types, as will be remembered from each one described in this book.]
And they are diverse in their penetration and division in two ways: one is according to the type of abscess itself, and the other is due to the nature of the humors (i.e., bodily fluids). (Note: In medieval medicine, the body was believed to be made up of four "humors" or bodily fluids: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. These humors were thought to influence a person's health, temperament, and appearance, and imbalances in them could lead to disease.) [Corrected version: And abscesses are diverse in their penetration and division in two ways: one is according to the type of abscess itself; and another is due to the nature of the humors (i.e., bodily fluids).]
And the second way is according to the location in which they occur in the body, as an abscess occurring in the head is different from one that occurs in the buttocks; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy area is different from one that occurs in a joint; and each of them has its own treatment through surgery. (Note: The location of a disease or condition was considered an important factor in medieval medicine, as it could indicate the type of humoral imbalance or other cause involved. This information would then be used to determine the appropriate course of treatment.) [Corrected version: And the second way is according to the locations in which they occur in the body, as the abscess occurring in the head is different from one that occurs in the buttocks; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy area is different from one that occurs in a joint; and each of them has its own treatment through surgery.]
And there are some abscesses that must not be pierced but rather allowed to mature and heal on their own. (Note: Medieval surgeons would often use various techniques to encourage the pus in an abscess to drain, such as incision or lancing. However, in some cases, they may have chosen to wait for the abscess to mature and heal on its own, depending on the location, size, and severity of the abscess.) [Corrected version: And there are certain abscesses that must not be pierced but rather allowed to mature and reach a conclusion (i.e., healing) in them.]
And there are other abscesses that must be pierced when they are hard and not matured according to their course, such as abscesses that are near joints, for when an abscess is close to a joint, its duration is prolonged until it affects the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing contraction of that limb; or if the abscess is near a major organ, and if you delay piercing it until it matures, it may harm the main organ; or if it is near the buttocks, then it should be pierced before it matures; and it is not advisable to pierce an abscess that is not fully ripe and hard, except for one that is near the buttocks, so as not to cause a prolapse of it and extend it to the internal parts of the buttocks, causing a fistula or incomplete healing. (Note: The text suggests that medieval surgeons would have used their clinical judgment to determine when an abscess should be pierced and drained, taking into account factors such as its location, size, severity, and stage of development.)[Corrected version: And there are other abscesses that must be pierced when they are hard and not matured according to their course, such as those near joints. For when an abscess is near a joint, its duration is prolonged until it affects the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing contraction of that limb; or if the abscess is near a major organ, and if you delay piercing it until it matures, it may harm the main organ; or if it is near the buttocks, then it should be pierced before it matures. It is not advisable to pierce an abscess that is not fully ripe and hard, except for one that is near the buttocks, so as not to cause a prolapse of it and extend it to the internal parts of the buttocks, causing a fistula or incomplete healing.] And it is necessary that you know the time for piercing the abscess, and that is when it has matured. (Note: The text emphasizes the importance of timing in surgical procedures such as piercing an abscess, as doing so too early or too late can have negative consequences for the patient.)[Corrected version: And it is necessary that you know the time for piercing the abscess, which is when it has matured.]
And know that it is mature when there is a decrease in pain and fever, and also a decrease in redness and swelling, as well as the hardness of the abscess and other signs. (Note: The text lists several signs that indicate an abscess has matured and is ready to be pierced, such as decreased pain, fever, redness, and swelling, as well as a decrease in the firmness or hardness of the abscess. These signs would have helped medieval surgeons determine when it was safe to pierce the abscess and allow its contents to drain.) [Corrected version: And know that it is mature when there is a cessation of pain and fever, as well as a decrease in redness, swelling, and hardness of the abscess, along with other signs.]
And it is necessary that you know that the incision should be made lower than the abscess and away from the point where the pus will flow after healing of the eminence (i.e., elevated area). (Note: The text advises against making the incision directly over the abscess or in a location where the pus may collect after healing, as this can lead to further complications and delayed recovery.) [Corrected version: And it is necessary that you know that the incision should be made below the abscess and away from the point where the pus will flow after healing of the eminence (i.e., elevated area).]
And the incision should always be made along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and in the regions of the ligaments, nerves, arteries; and finally, in all equal places where there is no reflection (i.e., folds or creases); for in those that are reflected, use incision according to the member (i.e., tailor it to the specific location). (Note: The text advises against making incisions across the natural lines of the body, such as joints, folds, and creases, as this can lead to further complications and delayed healing. Instead, surgeons should make incisions parallel to these lines in order to minimize trauma and promote healing.) [Corrected version: And the incision should always be made along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and in regions of ligaments, nerves, arteries; and finally, in all equal places where there is no reflection (i.e., folds or creases). For those that are reflected, use incision according to the member (i.e., tailor it to the specific location).]
But when the abscess is in a fleshy area, it is better to leave the incision until the digestion of it has been confirmed according to its course (i.e., allowed to mature fully), as we have said; for if you pierce it beforehand, there will be prolongation of its contents and much dirt, and soon the lips of the wound become hardened and deepen. (Note: The text emphasizes the importance of waiting for an abscess to fully mature before attempting to drain or incise it, in order to minimize the risk of infection and promote healing.) [Corrected version: But when the abscess is in a fleshy area, it is better to leave the incision until the digestion (i.e., maturation) of it has been confirmed according to its course (i.e., allowed to mature fully), as we have said; for if you pierce it beforehand, there will be prolongation of its contents and much dirt, and soon the edges of the wound become hardened and deepen.]
But some abscesses must be pierced according to the width of the flesh or body depending on necessity, or according to what the member requires (i.e., the specific needs of the affected area). (Note: The text recognizes that there may be situations where an abscess needs to be pierced before it has fully matured, such as when it is causing significant pain, impeding function, or poses a risk of infection or other complications.) [Corrected version: But some abscesses must be pierced according to the width of the flesh or body depending on necessity, or according to what the affected member requires.]
And it is necessary to perform a small incision in small abscesses and a large and wide incision or many sections according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses. (Note: The text advises that the size and number of incisions should be tailored to the specific needs of each abscess, with larger and more extensive incisions used for larger and more severe abscesses.) [Corrected version: And it is necessary to perform a small incision in small abscesses and a large and wide incision or many sections according to the diversity of sizes of the abscesses.]
And there are other abscesses where it is necessary that the cavity be concave and open when it has formed in such a way as bread and has been made in time that it is already established, just as one that occurs in the groin or in the buboes (i.e., swollen lymph nodes). (Note: The text suggests that some abscesses may require surgical intervention to create an opening or cavity for drainage, especially if they are large, deep-seated, or located in areas with thick layers of tissue.) [Corrected version: And there are other abscesses where it is necessary that the cavity be concave and opened when it has formed in such a way as bread and has been made in time that it is already established, just as one that occurs in the groin or in the buboes (i.e., swollen lymph nodes).]
And there are some that are incised with a section having three angles; and these are those where the incision is made in such a way as the shape of a myrtle leaf, just as in abscesses of athletes (i.e., boils or abscesses caused by strenuous exercise or friction). (Note: The text suggests that certain types of abscesses may require specific incision techniques to promote optimal drainage and healing, such as creating a triangular or myrtle-leaf shaped opening.) [Corrected version: And there are some that are incised with a section having three angles; and these are those where the incision is made in such a way as the shape of a myrtle leaf, just as in abscesses of athletes (i.e., boils or abscesses caused by strenuous exercise or friction).] [Continued in Part 3...]
And there are those where a round section or crescent-shaped incision is performed, similar to these. (Note: The text indicates that certain types of abscesses may require specific shapes and sizes of incisions to optimize drainage and promote healing.) [Corrected version: And there are some in which a round or crescent-shaped incision is performed, similar to these.]
If the one who has such a thing that is not like deep-seated abscesses, but rather superficial abscesses or boils, it is necessary that you lance it with a shallow, or flat, incision.
And it is necessary when the abscess is large and has already gathered pus, that you lance it and do not be afraid to drain only part of the pus at that time; after draining some of the pus, return the next day to fill the abscess with poultices, and then drain a larger portion, and do this many times until the abscess is fully drained.
Especially if the patient is of a frail constitution, or a woman in childbirth, or a young child, or an elderly person in a weakened state, for the vital spirit often dissipates with the evacuation of pus and the patient can quickly take a turn for the worse. Therefore, be cautious in your treatment.
Pay close attention to this chapter and consider carefully the incision you make when lancing these abscesses. If the surface of the abscess is small or flat, then apply a few leeches or use a medicinal paste. But if the abscess is large and the incisions are numerous, then it is necessary to place a wick in each opening so that they can all drain together.
If a piece of the skin around the abscess has been cut off or if it has become concave in shape, then it is necessary to pack the wound with dry cloth or thread made from linen, like when you dress wounds or cuts that are not wet. Strengthen this packing over the course of three days and continue the treatment until the wound is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood during your treatment, then apply cold water and vinegar compresses to the area, changing them frequently. This will help stop the bleeding.
But if the bleeding persists, then you should administer treatment and use powders that I have recommended in various parts of this book, depending on the situation.
But if the abscess is located in an area with many nerves and it is wintertime, then it is necessary to apply poultices made of vinegar and heated oil to the area. This will help alleviate any pain or discomfort caused by the cold weather.
But if it is summer and the area around the abscess is fleshy, then it is necessary to apply poultices made with water and oil or vinegar and oil, changing them frequently over the course of three days. Then you should open the abscess, clean the wound, and administer treatment as needed until it is healed.
And this is the knowledge that is necessary for the treatment of abscesses in general, but as I have already said, each type of abscess requires a specific approach to healing, which I will discuss further in individual chapters.
Chapter 41.
Chapter 41: On the treatment of abscesses that appear on the scalp.
On the scalp, there are small abscesses that resemble knots and have their own outer coverings. These abscesses can take many forms.
And these small abscesses have heads, or tips, and they may contain fluid that resembles lime in texture. And some of these abscesses contain fluid that resembles powder or sand, while others are hard and stonelike in texture. [Continued in the next message... ]
And in general, and in the treatment of all of these types of abscesses, there is no cause for concern. This is because the lancing of the abscess will not create any unwanted tension or resistance.
The operation for lancing these abscesses involves using an instrument called an "entromes" to probe them until you are certain that they have been fully opened and drained.
Therefore, if the abscess contains fluid, then you should make an incision along its length in a surface cut according to this shape:
Begin the incision at point B and continue along the line to point G, where the fluid is contained. Once the fluid has been drained, be sure to excise the entire area that contained it, leaving no remnants or residue behind, as any remaining tissue could become infected or cause further complications.
Then apply a poultice of Egyptian cotton if it is available, or else use a mixture of water and salt. Cover the wound with this poultice and leave it on for a day, as this will help dissolve any remaining tissue from the abscess wall.
Then apply a poultice of Egyptian cotton again if necessary, repeating the process two more times until you are confident that all remaining tissue from the abscess wall has been dissolved. Once this is achieved, continue to treat the wound with an appropriate ointment until it is fully healed.
If the abscess contains hard or fatty nodes, then you should make an incision according to this shape: with a cross-shaped incision, making one inch-long cut between the two lips of the incision and then cutting through all layers of tissue until you reach the outermost layer or "tunic" of the abscess. Use your strength to extract this outermost layer, which contains the infected material.
But if your hand or arm becomes tired or resists the incision, then do what I have told you to do previously.
Similarly, proceed with incision and treatment of the stony abscess according to what I have told you; and when incising a stony abscess, be aware that it is easier to cut through, as it contains little blood and fluid.
Some times there are boils of this kind that are in the head in some men, with whom there is not too much moisture; this happens because bile has solidified on a boil in the head of an old woman, and the boil appears as hard as a stone, rough, white, which cannot be punctured, and if anyone strikes it with force, they would be harmed.
But in other boils that occur in the head, this is not the case, such as the boils that appear in children's heads near the ears, but the section of these should be superficial.
And make an incision in those that are lower down on them, so that the body is relieved of the pus in the lower parts.
Then treat those with what is appropriate for their healing.
Chapter 42.
On the incision of scrofulas, which occur in the neck.
Often these boils occur in the neck and armpits and groins, and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those that occur in the neck are mostly generated between them, and every scrofula of these is within its own tunic, and as in the nodes and boils of the head, as we have said.
And the types of these scrofulas are many, for some are stony, and some contain moisture, and some are malignant, which do not respond to treatment.
Therefore in the one that you see of good disposition in touch, whose color, which is visible, is similar to the color of the skin, and is healthy all around, and not connected to the neck nerve, nor veins, nor arteries, and not prominent, it is necessary that you make an incision in this one with a dry superficial cut, from above the body part to below, along the line of G to the line of B, and peel off all sides, and extend two lips of the skin with an ounce or several ounces if necessary for those, as we have said in the boils of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is more caution that the vein or nerve should not be incised.
And the spatula should not be too sharp, so that it does not fit your hand with incision, or disturb the patient, and that you incise what is not necessary to incise; for if you were to incise a vein or artery, you would prohibit yourself from the operation, then stop at the wound with vitriol trissat or other powders which stop the flow of blood, and tighten the wound, and leave it in place until the acuteness of the boil subsides and the wound softens and begins to become purulent. When the blood is stopped.
Therefore, return to your operation until you have completed it.
Then ask with your skilled judgment if there are any other small scrofulas present, and if so, incise those and clean them out.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, it is necessary then not to incise that scrofula from its base. Before that, you must ligate it with strong bile and leave it in place until it falls out by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old cotton that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment, and treat it.
And if you incise the entire scrofula, it is necessary then to bring the two lips of the wound together and suture them as soon as possible before any excess remains.
But if you see that there is excess remaining due to the large size of the scrofula, it is necessary then to pay attention to incising its root, and remove it and provide suture and what has been said.
And those scrofulas that contain moisture, perforate them with superficial incisions at the point of their maturation, and stop the incision where it dries up the pus in the lower part of the body, as we have said.
And provide incision, hot compresses with ointment and similar things for that, so that it dissolves what has remained of the corruption. And when you see that the wound is already cleaned, it is necessary then to treat it with flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
Chapter 43.
On the incision of the pilonidal abscess located in the gluteal fold. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilonidal\_sinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilonidal_sinus)
The ancients called this incision "epilhon", and I have not seen any person in our land who has done that.
This is the title of the chapter about that.
But in men with sciatica, it is necessary to avoid extracting the pilonidal abscess, because it does not provide any benefit due to the fact that all the veins and major blood vessels of the patient are located here.
But in those who have boils in the mouth or buttock cleft or two ears, when the illness is not in the spine, it is necessary to avoid incising the pilonidal abscess, as this can cause the danger that results from penetration.
Therefore it is necessary when we want that, to incise the pilonidal abscess below three circles of the pilonidal abscess, or four with a small incision along the length in the one that is between two circles by amount, so that the incision is even, not on the cartilage, and this location is suitable for incision, because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels of blood from it are loose.
And if the doctor is inexperienced, then it is necessary to extend the skin of the gluteal fold with an ounce and then make an incision in the skin until reaching the canal, but avoid blood vessels for any reason.
And then incise the lips as we have said, and it is indicated on the incision of the canal by the flame which comes out from it due to its breakage and the removal of the cyst.
And leave the wound open for some time.
And when the time comes when incision is feared, add two lips of the skin to the wound, and suture only on the cartilage.
And then administer medications that promote the growth of flesh until it is healed.
And it is said by Albucasis that the essence of what we have discussed, the explanation is nothing but to see that some of these boils have filled the gluteal fold of the patient and the patient has died and their intestines are trapped, and some want to incise the epiglottis so that the patient can breathe over the site of the wound for some breath and be saved from death.
And for this reason, I command leaving the wound open until the wickedness of the illness is consumed; and the wickedness of it lasts for three days; and therefore I command covering the wound in this way and treating it until it is healed.
And what I have seen myself practicing as a physician is that a maid took a knife and inserted it in her own throat, cutting part of the cartilage of the trachea, and I was called to cure her, and I found her moaning like the dying, and I discovered the wound and found the blood which was flowing out of the wound a little.
Therefore, I confessed that she had not cut a vein or artery, but the air was escaping from the wound, and I cured her until she was healed.
And it did not harm the maid, but only affected her voice, and after several days she returned to her normal condition.
And now I say that in the treatment of abscesses there is no fear.
Chapter 44.
On the treatment of an abscess that occurs in the throat externally, and is called a cervical hernia.
This abscess, called a cervical hernia, is a large abscess according to the complexion of the body, and it is common in women.
And it can occur in two ways, either naturally or accidentally.
And in the natural case, there is no need to cure it.
And the accidental case can occur in two ways, one of which is similar to fatty nodes, and the other way is similar to an abscess caused by a blockage of an artery, and this last case is dangerous. And one should not be presumptuous in treating it with surgery unless it is small. And you should probe and examine it with the finger, and if it resembles a fatty node and is not suspended by any veins, then you should incise it in the same way as nodes and extract it along with its contents from the skin and bursa; but if not, then the entire area must be examined thoroughly, and the wound should be treated appropriately until it heals.
Chapter 45.
On the classification of different types of nodes.
There are many types of large nodes, and I have already mentioned all their varieties in the previous section.
It is important to distinguish between a node and an abscess with uncertainty.
Therefore I say that an abscess is characterized by heat, fever, and intense pain until the boiling of the excess material subsides, and it is a complete putrefaction that ultimately stops the fever, pain, and warmth.
But in the case of a node, there is no heat, fever, or pain, and it contains only fluid like a lemon at its own place.
And the color of a node depends on the complexion of the body, and its beginning is like a goiter, and it forms in the same way as a cyst, whether large or small, and there are two types of nodes: those that contain fat and moisture, and the colors of the fluid vary, as I mentioned in the previous chapter.
Therefore, when treating a node, it is important to express the fluid and examine it at the beginning using an instrument called a probe, as described in the following chapter.
And this is the method of examination for abscesses and all types of swellings: you take this probe and insert it into the most humid part of the abscess or swelling that you find, and then gently rotate the probe, little by little, until you are certain that it has penetrated through the skin.
Then place your hand over the abscess according to its size, and then carefully remove the probe and observe what has been expressed from it.
And if the fluid has been expelled and is flowing out, regardless of its color, then you should incise it with a superficial cut, as I have mentioned in other cases of abscesses.
And if there is no fluid on the surface of the probe, then you know that it is fat.
And dry the area with a superficial incision in the shape of a cross like this: In this way, as you have been taught, apply ligatures to the wound and carefully remove the skin from all sides, preserving the membrane or sac if possible, and then extract the fatty tissue along with the swelling.
But if the swelling is ruptured during the operation, it will not be possible to extract any healthy tissue, and in many cases this leads to complications. Therefore, you should remove as much of the damaged tissue as possible until there is no further cause for concern.
Because if any residual material remains, whether little or too much, the swelling will return, according to its nature.
And if you see that a small portion of the swelling remains, then complete the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and strengthen the area, placing a cauterizing agent on the site of the abscess, and treat it with other appropriate treatments until it is healed.
And if the swelling is large, then you should suture its two lips and treat it with dressing that promotes healing.
But if there is a pulsating vein in opposition to the swelling, or if it is non-pulsating, then you should apply a poultice made with quicklime, which contains vitriol, and leave it in place for two or three days until the wound can be safely reopened and the boiling of the blood subsides. Then proceed to incise the swelling again.
Chapter 46.
On the forms of instruments necessary for incision and puncture.
There are three types of probes, which vary in size from large to medium to small.
The shape of the large probe is as follows:
The shape of the small probe is as follows:
They are made of iron, aloe wood, or with curved handles that fit well in the hand, allowing for quick insertion into abscesses.
And these are the shapes of the scalpels, which are named alberedes, and one type is called a berid.
And they come in three sizes: large, medium, and small.
The method of experiencing a great illness, find its cure:
The method of experiencing milder symptoms, find its remedy:
The method of experiencing less, find its cure:
It is appropriate that they are for those abscesses, ulcers, fistulas and buboes because of the presence between the bones and other causes.
And round, large, and broad leeches are used, similar to large needles with which sails are sewn, they are made of earthenware from citron trees, or of iron, or silver, and the best ones are those made of earthenware from citron trees.
And there are the experiences with black feathers, which remind one that through these (feathers) openings or fistulas in the cavity of which are reflections, should be reflected with their lightness by those reflections.
And they are of three types: some are long, others medium-sized, and others short, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and its constriction.
Method of experiencing a great illness with lead:
Method of experiencing milder symptoms with lead:
Method of experiencing lesser symptoms with lead:
The forms of the ulcers are of many types, for some are simple ulcers with only one curve, and they are of three types: large, small, and medium-sized.
And of their unhealthy humors, and these are of three kinds.
And of those unhealthy humors, they have two curves, and they are of three kinds.
And of them, some have three curves, and they are of three kinds.
And all those (humors) are necessary in their place.
The shape of a single small humor, like this:
The shape of a large humor with two curves: The shape of a medium-sized humor with two curves: The shape of a small humor with two curves:
The shape of a large humor with three curves:
The shape of a medium-sized humor with three curves:
And these are the shapes of the scalpels used to cut and remove swollen lymph nodes and abscesses, and they come in three types: large, medium, and small.
Shape of a large scalpel:
Shape of a medium scalpel:
Shape of a small scalpel:
The ends of those (instruments) that are used to make incisions are sharp and the others are not sharp, and they should not be placed in such a manner, but rather for making a benefit during the removal of nodes, so as to avoid injury to veins or nerves, and through their use the patient can be healed and find some relief from the inflammation that arises from the removal of an abscess.
And these are the shapes of almagates (medicinal pastes), and they come in three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
There are also methods for making clay (or similar substances) that are similar to those used in the production of alcohol.
And it is in the end of the instrument that has been pierced with a sharp point and hidden inside, and from which flows liquid both internally and externally, whenever you wish, as you see.
The shapes of spatulas, which are hidden between the teeth during the piercing of abscesses and are not noticed by the patients, and they come in three types: large, medium, and small. And these are the shapes of those (instruments).
The shapes of leeches used to cut off the flow of blood, and they come in three types; large, medium, and small; the shapes of them are as follows:
There are also methods for making clay (or similar substances) that are round and somewhat elongated, and they are fine (thin or delicate).
And it is necessary that these types of cups be of different sizes, large, medium, and small, so that through them you can release flows of blood with speed when necessary, and at first, when there is no medication.
However, do not use them to draw blood from every part of the body, but only from fleshy parts, such as the fleshy areas of the legs and thighs, the upper arms, breasts, stomach, and groin, and similar places where there is plenty of flesh.
And sometimes it is necessary to use other small instruments similar to syringes of this form, through which blood can be drawn when making an incision for phlebotomy or opening a vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round in the following form:
Chapter 47.
On the treatment of men's breasts, which resemble those of women.
Sometimes, the breasts of some men become swollen due to excessive sleep, and they become enlarged like women's breasts do when they begin to lactate, or in cases of Roman fever (malarial fever), which is far away.
And for those who suffer from this, it is necessary to make an incision in the shape of a crescent moon along the line between B and G, remove all the thickened tissue, apply carmine-based medication on the wound, suture the two lips of the wound together, and ensure that the inside is clean before it heals.
But if the breast sags downwards and becomes soft like that of a woman, then it should be cut in half along its upper parts with two crescent-shaped incisions, each one contained within the other until the larger one contains the smaller one, as shown in this diagram between B and G. Then remove the tissue from between the two lips of the wound, drain any pus, apply medication, suture the wound, and administer any necessary powder or ointment during the healing process until it heals completely.
And if you do not make the necessary incision due to the patient's discomfort or excessive bleeding, then it is necessary to apply a compress of dry, absorbent material soaked in corrosive ointment and allow it to dissolve any remaining tissue until it heals.
Chapter 48.
On the puncturing of abscesses that arise in the lower region of the body due to itching.
These abscesses that arise in the lower region of the body due to itching are a type of scrofula, hard and covered with thick skin.
And some of these abscesses contain fluid, and in such cases, it is necessary to make a crescent-shaped incision along the line between G and B. Once all the pus has been drained from the abscess, pack it with dry material and leave it alone for another day.
Then apply appropriate ointment to the packing material and dress the wound until it heals completely.
And if the abscess is in the form of a lymph node or a scrofula, then cut it open as I have described for scrofulas.
But if the wound is extensive and there is a risk of gangrene, then apply cautery as I have described before.
Chapter 49.
On the incision of abscesses caused by veins or arteries.
When an artery is ruptured and the surrounding tissue has hardened, it often results in abscesses. Some signs that indicate the inflammation and abscess are due to an artery or a vein include: firstly, when the abscess caused by an artery is long and located near the heart; secondly, when you press on the abscess with your fingers, you can hear a stridor (a harsh, blowing sound).
And abscess caused by a vein is round and apparent on the surface of the body.
Incision on such abscesses is risky, especially in areas like the armpits, groin, and neck, where large blood vessels are located. In cases of very large abscesses, it is advisable to avoid surgical treatment altogether. Similarly, abscesses located in the extremities or on the head should be avoided.
However, for abscesses caused by inflammation of the orifice of an artery, make a long incision in the surrounding tissue and use forceps to widen the incision and expose the artery, removing its outer layers until it is exposed.
Then place a needle over the incision and insert it into the other layer, and tie off the artery with double-stranded suture in two places – this causes ischemia (lack of blood flow) and facilitates the extraction of two arteries that are found only in temples.
Then apply pressure to the area between two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood is drained and the abscess is resolved.
Then administer treatment to prevent gangrene from developing in the area, and dress the wound with appropriate ointments until it heals completely.
If the abscess is caused by incision of a vein, then hold the area with your hand as close to the abscess as possible and insert the needle below the area you are holding. Then use double-stranded thread to pull out the contents from the other side, and tie off the abscess using a strong ligament in a figure-eight pattern, as I have previously described for grape ligatures with two ends of the thread.
But if you are concerned about pulling out the thread, then insert a suture needle below the entire abscess along the incision line and tighten the sutures in four places.
Then drain the abscess by pressing it gently from the middle towards the incision site until all the pus is released, and then use scissors to cut away any excess tissue that remains attached to the wound.
Then place a pad soaked in wine and oil on top of the wound, and administer treatment using warm compresses and ointments until it heals completely.
Chapter L (50) on abscess caused by nerve injury.
Just as abscesses occur in arteries and veins, similar abscesses can also develop in nerves when there is injury or excessive strain on them.
This type of abscess is most commonly found in the areas around joints, such as the ankles or wrists, or anywhere where joints are prone to injury.
This type of abscess is severe and has the same color as other parts of the body. It tends to form in large clusters and can cause a state of stupor when it compresses surrounding tissues with great force.
Unlike other types of abscesses that form near the heart, this type is located away from the heart and does not extend forward or backward. Instead, it spreads in all directions.
Therefore, it is not advisable to treat this type of abscess with surgical incision because it can easily lead to contracture (scarring or stiffening of the surrounding tissues).
However, if the abscess is located on the head or forehead, then it can be treated by draining it with a spatula. But if the abscess is small, then extract it using forceps and make an incision with scissors.
If the abscess is large, then suspend it using hooks and remove any surrounding tissue that appears necrotic or dead. Then pack the wound with appropriate dressing material and close it using surgical sutures until it heals completely.
Chapter 51.
On the incision of abscesses that occur on the belly caused by hernia (cheil).
The growths that appear on the bellies of some people and on other parts of their bodies are called fungal because they resemble fungi; these have a subtle nature and a large head, and their lips are inverted; some are small, while others are greatly enlarged.
And I have seen one, and in his belly there were two parts that resembled large fungi, and there was no difference between them in whiteness, of small size.
And the lips of those parts were turned inside out and split open, and there was always moisture flowing from them.
Therefore I incised those parts and found in one of them a piece that weighed 18 ounces. And the other one weighed 5 ounces.
And the operation in the incision of them is that you consider whether the patient is moist, and if their flesh is white, moist, and of subtle size; then you incise with a broad spatula, and have cauteries present at the fire, because much matter must be expelled from the section of it, and if blood comes, cauterize that.
And if you see the patient is poor and fearful, be careful not to incise with iron; but instead take fresh lead filings, and strengthen their flesh in this way, which we have mentioned; and leave it for two days.
Then apply the lead filings to the constriction; and do not stop strengthening the large wound of the flesh until it is cut off and falls by itself without trouble.
But if the wound is of large size, then there is some cause for fear and dread in the incision of it, especially in one that is on the belly.
But it is possible that you incise the majority of it and then cauterize that part so that it does not return.
And take care of it until the wound is healed.
And be careful not to presume to incise a wound that is of dark color, with little feeling, and with little regard for it, because that is cancerous.
And I will come with a reminder of cancer in this regard.

Treatment for a protruding navel (umbilical hernia)
The protrusion of the navel (umbilical hernia) can be caused by several factors, such as ruptures in the cipha (a membrane above the belly button), which cause the skin or intestine to bulge out, just as it happens with other ruptures. It can also be caused by blood that flows from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned, or by constricted windiness in the navel.
But if it is caused by a rupture in the cipha and the emergence of the skin or intestine, then the color of the abscess will be similar to the color of the body; it will not be painful, and its appearance will vary depending on the location. But if it is caused by the emergence of the intestine, then its appearance will be similar to what we have described before, but with even greater diversity, and when you press on it with your fingers, it will hide, and then return; it can easily go back in, but it becomes greatly swollen and painful when it is near a bath or there is much work involved.
But if it is caused by moisture, then it is not painful and does not hide when you press on it with your hand, nor is it constricted or swollen.
But if it is caused by blood, then the abscess will appear with darkened coloration.
But if it is caused by flesh that has hardened and thickened, then the abscess will be serious, large, and hard, and its size will be fixed.
But if it is caused by windiness (gas), then touching it will not cause any pain.
And the operation for this condition is that you consider whether the protrusion of the navel is caused by blood from an artery or a vein, or by windiness (gas); in that case, you must refrain from treating it because, as we have taught you in the chapter on abscesses caused by arteries and veins, there is danger and fear involved.
And if the protrusion of the navel is caused by the intestines or the skin, then you must command the patient to hold their belly, and stand with their legs apart; then you should mark the circumference of the entire navel with a probe, and command them to lie face down between your hands on their stomach, and then encircle the circumference of the navel with a broad spatula at the location that you have marked with the probe; and then extend the swelling towards the surrounding areas using large hooks; and finally bind it in the circumference with strong thread or cord in an appropriate manner.
And then place the middle of the swelling on the ligature and insert your finger into that location, and search for the intestine; if you have found it and held it with the ligature, then you can pull gently and push the intestines back inside the belly.
And if you have found the skin or tissue, then take it with forceps and incise any excess that may be present.
But if it is contrary to your artery or vein, then you should encircle that area and return to your operation; and take two needles and place strong sutures on them, then insert the two needles into the circumference that you have made around the abscess in a cross shape, and pull the sutures tight to draw the swelling in four directions.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area alone until the flesh has retracted and falls by itself; or you can incise it when it has become thinner and softer, and then take care of it with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if the protrusion of the navel is caused by hardened flesh or moisture, then you should evacuate the abscess as we have described, removing the blood or moisture that you find in it, and then take care of it with appropriate treatments to strengthen the area.
Capital LIII (53)
Treatment for cancer (crab)
We have already spoken in the division about the type of cancer and how it should be treated with medicines, that it is advisable to treat cancer with medicines rather than iron so that it does not become ulcerated; and we have said that cancer generated in the marrow requires great caution in its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a location where it is possible to extract it, such as a cancer that is in the breasts or in the thigh, and similarly on members that can be removed entirely, and especially when it is beginning and small.
But when it is old and large, it is not appropriate to attempt to treat it, because I cannot heal such cancer nor have I seen anyone else who has, nor has anyone reached a cure for it.
And the operation for it, when it is located as we have said, is that you proceed and bleed the patient, purging them of black bile several times, and let their blood if there is clear congestion present.
And prepare the patient with a preparation for the operation, and prohibit them from eating any food that could obstruct the surgery; and cleanly make an incision all around with good cautery, ensuring that there remains no cause of infection in it. And let the blood flow, and do not close the wound lightly, and press on the areas, and clean away the thick blood with your hand or an instrument that is available to you.
But if it is against your will to have thick blood flow from an incision of a vein or artery, then cauterize that area until the flow of blood ceases, and treat the wound with another remedy until it has healed.
Chapter 50. (based on the context)
Of the treatment of dropsy.
As we have previously mentioned in the division, of the different types of dropsy and their symptoms, we will now discuss the treatment of it with medicines. (Note: I translated "species" as "types" and "senhals" as "symptoms" based on context)
And the type of dropsy that is cured with iron is only the type of ascites, and it should not be approached with iron for the types of tympanites nor for the type of hydrothorax, because that is deadly. (Note: I translated "ferr" as "iron" based on context and prior knowledge)
And when you have already treated this type of dropsy tympanites with medicines and do not see an improvement in the patient's condition, then consider, because if the patient is already weakened or has another illness along with this dropsy, such as cough or abdominal pain, then be careful to not treat them with iron, because it is dangerous. (Note: I translated "comfereys" as "see an improvement" based on context and prior knowledge)
But if you see that the patient is in good health and has no other illness but only dropsy, and they are neither infants nor elderly, then the method of operation for them is to lift the patient between your hands and have them expel the air from their stomach with their hand, push the water towards the lower part of their abdomen, and then take a piece of spongy material in this manner:
should be two-sided with pointed ends like a sponge, but have some small thickness gradually, in order to avoid penetrating the intestine during the operation and causing harm to it. (Note: I translated "passes entro" as "penetrate" based on context)
And consider if the generation of dropsy is from parts of the intestines, because in that case, you must make the incision at a distance of three fingers downwards towards the lower abdomen, to the right of the navel. (Note: I translated "seccio" as "incision" based on context)
But if the generation of dropsy is due to a liver illness, then your incision should be to the left of the navel by three fingers. (Note: I translated "fietge" as "liver" based on context)
And if the generation of dropsy is due to the spleen, then your incision should be to the right. (Note: I translated "melsa" as "spleen" based on context)
And it is not appropriate for your incision to be on the side where the patient wants to lie, because then the excess fluid may run to that weak area. (Note: I translated "superfluitatz" as "excess fluid" based on context)
And then pierce the entire abdominal wall with an instrument, and enter that incision, and lift your hand with the sponge between the abdominal wall and the peritoneum, and extract what you can; it should be about the size of a fingernail or thereabouts. (Note: I translated "siphac" as "peritoneum" based on context)
And then pierce the peritoneum until the sponge reaches the empty space, which is where the water is. (Note: I translated "ciphac" as "peritoneum" and "loc vuoyt" as "empty space" based on context) And then extract it and insert an instrument of this shape: and it resembles a thin silver cannula; it is made of silver or iron or lead, with a small hole at the bottom, and on both sides there are three holes: two on one side and one on the other side; and its end is sharpened like a feather quill, as you see. (Note: I translated "canula" as "cannula" based on context)
And on the highest end of it is an armilla, because when the instrument reaches the water, that will immediately rise to cover the instrument, and thus the water can be evacuated in a moderate quantity, because if you evacuate more than necessary at once, then the patient may die quickly due to loss of their animal spirit, or they may develop a five-day fever which is close to death. (Note: I translated "armilla" as "stopper" based on context and prior knowledge, "sieu spirit animal" as "animal spirit", and "cincopi" as "five-day fever")
But evacuate according to the strength of the patient and according to what their physical signs indicate to you, such as the quality of their pulse and their overall health. (Note: I translated "vertut" as "strength", "disposicios" as "physical signs", "bontat" as "health", and "pols" as "pulse")
And then extract the instrument, and retain the water which is caused by the abdominal wall that immediately retains the hole on the peritoneum, as I have previously instructed you to pierce it in this way. (Note: I translated "ciphac" as "peritoneum")
And then insert the instrument again on the following day if you see that the patient tolerates it, and extract a small quantity of water, and do this for several days with caution, and be careful not to leave too much water in the body. (Note: I translated "jorns" as "days", "tolerant" as "tolerates", and "error" as "mistake")
But if you are concerned about the patient's health, and you leave a large quantity of water, then treat it with hot sand burial, and use suction in baths, and expose the patient to the sun for a long time; and treat them with drying medicines until they are healed. (Note: I translated "sepultura en arena cauda" as "hot sand burial", based on context)
And cauterize above the stomach, and the spleen and liver during the evacuation of water, as I have described earlier in what comes before. (Note: I translated "cauteriza" as "cauterize", "stomac" as "stomach", "melsa" as "spleen", and "fitge" as "liver")
Chapter 55 (based on context)
On the treatment of children who are born with unperforated genital openings. (Note: I translated "locs" as "openings")
Sometimes some children are born from their mother's womb and the head of their genital opening is not perforated (or it is narrow or not in its proper place). (Note: I translated "cap de la sua mixtio" as "head of the genital opening")[/
Therefore, it is necessary to pierce it with perforation as soon as it is born with a very fine instrument in this way: (Note: I translated "perforacio" as "perforation", "spatum" as "instrument", and "mot subtil" as "very fine")
And then insert a thin nail of lead into the hole and tie it there for three or four days. (Note: I translated "clavil" as "nail", "plom" as "lead", "per tres jorns o per .iiii.tre" as "for three or four days")
And when the child shows signs of wanting to urinate and starts to dribble, then remove it. (Note: I translated "remaugut" as "shows signs", "hurine" as "starts to dribble")
And if you do not insert the lead, it is possible that the urine flowing over the area will not be able to pass through the hole. (Note: I translated "claure" as "pass through")
But if the child's opening is narrow, they should be treated with a lead nail for many days until it becomes wider. (Note: I translated "trops" as "many")
But in cases where the opening is not in its proper location, it is necessary to correct it by moving the foreskin to the tip of the penis so that the child can urinate properly and the sperm can reach the mother during intercourse, as this condition can cause infertility. (Note: I translated "vergua" as "penis", "mayre" as "mother", "rectitut" as "properly", "laga" as "serious")
The method of the operation in this case is that the patient should be positioned face down, and you should extend the head of the patient's penis with your left hand using strong traction, and make a incision at the tip of the penis's foreskin with a sharp spatula, similar to an inkwell or without cutting any part, so that the inside of the foreskin resembles the head of the penis and the foreskin falls in the middle as needed.
And be careful in your operation for bleeding, as it often happens; and place yourself at the site where you are cutting the blood vessel, and cure the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 46.
Of albater, which occurs in the foreskin at the head of the penis, and of corruption, darkness and adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis.
Often, this albater (balanitis) occurs on the penis and is characterized by an eminence of flesh that appears.
And one type is malignant and the other is not.
In the case of non-malignant cases, it is advised to use fine hooks and remove the affected area until all is cleaned out, then place a cotton swab soaked in Egyptian ointment over the wound; and apply this remedy until the wound heals completely.
And if the albater (balanitis) is malignant and of a dark color, then it is advised to use cautery near the incision and cutting of it.
But if the albater (balanitis) is in the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis and one part of it is inside the foreskin while the other part is outside, then it is advised to remove the albater that is inside first, until it becomes solidified; and then cure the area outside, because if you try to cure both at the same time with the foreskin, it's not guaranteed that it won't be damaged.
And if you notice discoloration and corruption in the genitals and foreskin, then it is advised to remove all that has become darkened and that which is beginning to rot or is already rotten; and apply a liniment over it made with honey, which is mixed with flour of millet groats and crushed and sieved ivy.
And then cure it with the other remedy until it is healed.
But if bleeding persists, then administer lunar cautery in the following way:
because cautery juvenile is for two conditions at the same time, that is bleeding and the wound when it becomes corrupt.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and destroyed at that moment, then it is advised to insert a leaden cannula into the meat of the foreskin in order for the patient to urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis (and this adhesion does not occur unless it is uncircumcised and circumcision is not required, and when adhesion occurs due to wounds or abscesses) it is advised to scrape with a blunt spatula until the ligaments are dissolved and the head of the penis is released from all sides.
And if it is difficult to separate those adhesions carefully, then it is advised to scrape the head of the penis and foreskin with a spatula for some time; this is because the foreskin, when thin, is easily pierced due to its delicate nature.
And then separate between the foreskin and head of the penis with a thin probe (dra7) that has been soaked in water, in order to prevent further adhesion.
And then cure it with a styptic agent (vi stiptic) until it becomes solidified.
Chapter 57.
Of the cleansing of infants and the healing of that which happens to those who have undergone circumcision.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity like other wounds, but because it is part of our operation and our will, and its purpose is specifically in children, it is necessary that we assign to it the best possible procedure and lightest loss for their health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not practice circumcision on their free men, because it was not used in their laws. And this is because we have learned through experience that I have found most artisans and barbers using circumcision with a novacula (a type of knife) and cautery; and they use ligatures with filings and incisions with the nail.
And I have prohibited all these methods and did not find any better cleansing than with forceps, with ligatures of filings like the incision with the nail, because many times the foreskin escapes being cut, because the foreskin has two tunics, and the inner one remains below, and it is very easy to make another incision and cause sure pain. And with the type of cleansing performed by alphecati (mohel), which is done digitally, that the shoemakers use, the incision at the end of the male member is not safe, because it easily slips into its opening.
But in the operation with a nail, it is very easy to blunt the iron and corrupt your operation. And the foreskin of an infant is short by nature, and many times it happens in such a way that there is no need for cleansing, and I have seen this.
But I have found through experience that the cleansing done with forceps and ligatures of filings is better. This is because the forceps make a proportional incision, so the sharpness above is equal to the sharpness below. And thus when you press your hand proportionally on both sharp edges, and cut according to a ratio in a certain amount of time; and it is made with a compression of filings that completely surrounds the foreskin of the rod, with which no error can occur.
And the method of the first operation is that you make the infant stand for a long time if it is one of those who can, and that you only tie the filings around its rod, leaving it on for another day.
And then do everything possible to make the infant happy and comfortable, so that it receives this procedure with understanding. And then make sure that the infant is held firmly and securely in your arms, and not loose; and hide the forceps in your hand or under your clothes so that the child does not see it or any other instrument.
And then place your hand on the rod of the infant and blow gently on its foreskin, and pull it forward so that the head of the rod is exposed; and then clean the foreskin of any dirt or impurities that have accumulated there.
The shape of the forceps used for cleansing should be as follows:
The ends of the forceps should be some sharp and others blunt, so that the tip of the blade is not exposed and the length of both cutting edges should be equal to the length of the handles.
The risk in cleansing is that it is very easy for the inner foreskin to escape being cut completely or partially, which requires a further incision.
Therefore, it is necessary that you pull the foreskin forward with your finger before making the incision and cut evenly according to its length.
And if you cannot pull it forward with your finger, then use a hook and make the incision.
But if three days have passed and there is still inflammation under the rod, then wait until the swelling has subsided before removing any excess skin with ease, and make the incision according to what you have prepared.
And be careful not to harm the head of the rod, as it should not be affected by this procedure.
And therefore, care for the wound with the powders that I recommended in the treatise on powders, so that the wound heals properly.
And if too much of the foreskin has been cut and it reaches the area above, this is not noticeable.
But be sure to care for the wound with what I have said until it heals completely.
Chapter 58.
On the treatment of urinary retention in the bladder.
Urinary retention in the bladder can be caused by an obstruction such as a stone or congealed blood, or by pus or flesh, and similar to those causes of division that we have mentioned for treatment.
And if it is not dissolved with what we have mentioned and the cause is strong in the patient, then extraction should be performed with an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: It should be made of silver and be thin and concave like a quill pen, with a long, thin rod in its head that resembles the length of a handspan and a half, to which a thin cannula should be attached.
And the method of extracting urine with this is that you take the doubled filings and tie them to the end of a wool or cotton thread, and insert the ends of the filings into the lower part of the syringe, and make an incision with forceps if there is any excess cause from the wool, but introduce it into the cannula with force. And then slowly push the syringe inward with care and caution.
And make the patient lie on their side and massage their bladder and rod with warm oils, such as olive oil and water.
And then insert the syringe gently until it reaches the root of the rod; and then bend the rod upwards towards the navel; and then push the syringe further inward, guiding it to enter the bladder. This will ensure that the catheter has reached its intended destination and not deviated from its path.
And slowly extract the bile with the wool, because the urine will stain the wool.
And do so gently and perform the cure for urine retention, using a syringe, do not stop doing this and use the syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter 59.
On the quality of enema preparation for the bladder using a clamp and similar instruments that are suitable for this purpose.
When there is an ulcer or abscess in the bladder, or blood clots have formed there, or it is constricted by hardness, and you want to cause fluids and medicines to flow into it, then use an instrument called a "clamp" with this shape:
but rather it is closed on the outside, meaning that it is sealed. And in this there are three openings: two on one side, as well as.
At the beginning there is a concave space, where that which is drawn in is located, and it should be according to the quantity that fills it, without addition, until when any cause pulls the humors from it, it is pulled, and when it is expelled, with that it is pulled, and when it is expelled for a long time, as the clamp does with which naphtha is injected in naval battles.
And so when you want to introduce fluids into the bladder, insert the end of the clamp into the fluid and pull with it that which is drawn in towards the upper parts, because the fluid is pulled into the concavity of the clamp.
And then insert the end of the clamp into the penis as we have recommended in the syringe; and then draw up the fluid with what you are drawing up, because that fluid will reach the bladder immediately, and the patient should feel it.
The shape of the subtle syringe with which the bladder is treated, and this is its shape:
And it is made of silver or lead, with its head resembling a small feather, and below that the tube descends gradually.
And then hold the bladder in motion and place it on the syringe so that you can introduce the fluid that you want to treat the bladder with, and then place the syringe between two strong ligatures using double thread, and heat the fluid over a fire.
And then insert the end of the syringe into the penis.
And then you should tighten your hand over the bladder with the fluid, using gentle pressure, until the patient feels that the fluid has reached the bladder.
But if the bladder is not present, then you should take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; and then perforate the entirety of its roundness; and then insert strong thread into those holes, so that they are tightly drawn together; and then attach the circle as if it were a funnel, so that you can hold in place whatever you want from among the humors, oils, and waters.
And then you should attach that to the instrument and use it in the same way as you did with the bladder, expressing it with your hand until the fluid reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
On the removal of calculi (stones) from the body.
We have already said in the division of the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and a stone generated in the bladder, and the symptoms of the latter.
And we have said that a stone can be operated on using the hand and cutting.
And a stone generated in the bladder properly speaking is one that is located in the bladder.
I will now explain this with clear and concise exposition.
And so I say that a stone generated in the bladder is most commonly found in children; and the symptoms of this are that the urine that comes out of the bladder resembles water in its subtlety, and appears as sand in it; and the patient scratches his penis, and many times feels pain, and then is erect; and with this he expels many words about it.
And the healing of children with this is possible up until they reach the age of fourteen; and it is a difficult cure in older individuals. But in young people it is easier because it is between those ages.
And with regard to the stone that is larger, its cure is easier; and if it is small, it is contrary to this.
Therefore, at the beginning of the cure for this, it is necessary to cleanse the patient with a sternutatory (emetic) medicine that extracts all the opening in the intestines, because this opening sometimes prevents the penetration of the stone during the examination.
Then place the patient with their feet elevated and have them lie on their bad side, so that the stone descends to the neck of the bladder or jumps out of its place several times.
Then perform the incision with your hands prepared, and have the patient's hands away from their body, so that the bladder is completely tilted towards the lower parts.
Then search for it (the stone) and remove it completely from the outside.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then make an incision immediately over it.
And if you do not find it completely, then it is necessary to anoint your left index finger with oil (if the patient is a child) or your middle finger (if the patient is an adult), and introduce it into their rectum. And search for the stone inside until you feel it with your finger. And gradually introduce it (the stone) into the neck of the bladder.
Then press on it (the stone) with your finger and push it outside through the incision you made.
And order the assistant to press on the bladder with their hand; and order another assistant to stretch out the patient's thighs with one of their hands, and with the other hand, hold down the flank that is below the thighs, in the area near where you made the incision.
Then introduce a well-sharpened spatula, which has this shape: and divide it (the spatula) in the area between the buttocks and thighs, not in the middle but rather towards the left side; and make the incision over the stone and place your finger in the rectum, making a transverse incision so that the outside opening is wide and the inside narrow, according to the size of the stone, but not larger, for it will be easy to compress the finger that is in the rectus near the stone with the incision, and the stone can easily be extracted.
And know that some stones have sharp angles and edges, making their removal difficult.
And such a stone resembles a kidney bean in shape, is round and has a smooth surface.
Therefore, if it is such a stone with sharp angles and edges, adjust the incision to fit it.
And if it is not easily extracted in this way, then it is necessary to push on it or pull on it with gentle traction, using an instrument that has a curved tip like a file, and you should not slip off the stone; or introduce a thin instrument with a curved tip.
But if you cannot reach it (the stone), then widen the incision slightly and if you see a flow of blood, cut through it with a strong hand using a 3 times heated vitriol.
But if there is more than one stone, then at the beginning, introduce your hand to the opening of the bladder and make an incision over it (the first stone); then gradually push a little further for each additional stone; and proceed in this manner if there are more than two.
And if the stone is very large, it is ignorance to make a large incision, for this can cause two problems for the patient: either they die or they develop continuous urinary discharge because the area is not completely healed.
But administer a purge before it (the stone) is extracted, or use forceps to extract it from the incision until it is removed in pieces.
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with pieces of aloe and dragon's blood, and apply pressure to it. And place a cloth soaked in oil and vinegar or rose oil and water over it (the wound), so that the abscess is reduced.
And then place the patient on their back with their head raised and do not remove the bandages until the third day.
And when you remove them (the bandages), wash the area with water and plenty of oil, then treat it with fine ointment and diabetic ointment until it is healed.
But if an abscess forms in the wound that is both adhesive and corrosive, and it resembles frozen blood in the bladder, which prevents urine flow (and this is known by the presence of blood in urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract the blood clot, for if it remains, it can cause corruption of the bladder and putrefaction.
And approach to wash the wound with wine vinegar, water and salt, and with opposition to all kinds, with whatever is convenient for the cure until it is healed.
And it is necessary during the entire course of treatment that you lie with both thighs spread and adjust the medications that are placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and located in the bladder, and has become impacted there, and urination is prohibited, then cure it with what I recommended before reaching incision, for too many have been accused of causing incision through this treatment; and I have proven that, and it is that you take a soft iron borer, which looks like this:
with a triangular extra piece, sharp, inserted into a handle.
And then take bile and tie it to the bladder below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
And then insert the iron into the bladder, penetrating with ease until it reaches the stone. And rotate the borer with your hand in the small stone, gradually enlarging the hole until the other side is penetrated, for urination will be released immediately.
And then press your hand on what is broken off from the stone from the outside of the bladder, for it is trapped and has been pushed out with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment is not suitable for some reason that prohibits it, then tie bile below the stone and another piece of bile above the stone. And then cauterize the stone in the bladder between two ligatures. And then extract it. And then untie the ligature and clean up the clotted blood in the wound.
And it is not necessary to tie a ligature below the stone, but only to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and another ligature above it is not needed either, for when the bile is untied, the kidney returns to its place and heals the wound.
And so it is necessary for you to lift the kidney upwards when you tie the bile above it, or let it return to its proper place and heal the wound as we have said.
Chapter 61.
On the extraction of bladder stones in women.
Bladder stones are rarely formed in women.
But if a stone is detected in any of them, then the cure is difficult and is forbidden in many ways.
One reason for this is that women are easily frightened.
And the second reason is that you cannot find a skilled woman who can determine if she has a stone or not when she is chaste or married to a man.
And the third reason is that you cannot find a skilled woman in this art, especially one who can perform the operation with her hand.
And the fourth reason is that the location of the incision above the stone in women is far from the location of the stone itself, requiring a deep incision and causing fear.
But if necessity forces you to do so, then it is necessary to take a skilled female surgeon, but they are rare.
But if you are deprived of that, then look for a skilled and careful male surgeon, or present a mature woman who is experienced in female matters, or a woman who has already partially mastered this art.
Therefore, make the presentation and order her to do everything that you command, starting with the examination for the stone; which is necessary because she must determine if the woman is a virgin, in which case she should insert her finger into the anus and feel for the stone.
Therefore, if she finds one, then pinch it below her finger and then order her to make an incision above it.
But if she is not a virgin, then order the mature woman to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and feel for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder and applying gentle pressure to help guide the stone towards her finger.
Therefore, if she finds one, then it is necessary to gradually move the stone from the orifice of the bladder down towards the perineum using the full extent of her skill and strength until it reaches the tip of the scrotum.
And then make an incision above the stone at the tip of the scrotum, in whichever location is most convenient for you, and center the stone in that location, ensuring that your finger does not become trapped or pinched by the stone.
And make the incision small at first, and then insert the scalpel into the incision and if you feel the stone, then adjust the size of the incision based on the size and shape of the stone that you expect to remove.
And know that the types of stones are many: some are small and large, hard and rough, long and round, with or without ridges.
Therefore, you should be aware of the different types of stones in order to indicate what you want to do about them.
And if you want to encourage bleeding, then apply a poultice of three hundred grains of verdigris and leave it on for an hour until the blood has been released, and then return to your operation until the stone has been removed.
And ensure that you prepare the necessary instruments for removing stones in men, so that you are assisted by them during your operation.
And if you want to encourage bleeding and know that the source of the bleeding is an artery that has been cut, then apply powder to the area and tighten it with a compress and bandage, but do not repeat this, and leave the stone in place and do not remove it, for the patient will soon die. And then treat the wound.
And when the intensity of the bleeding has decreased after several days and the wound has begun to heal, then you may return to your operation until the stone has been removed.
Chapter Sixty-Two.
On incision for an inguinal hernia.
An inguinal hernia is not anything other than an accumulation of moisture in the white membrane located below the kidneys of the genitals that contains the water, and is called the scrotum.
And sometimes it is in the proper fat that nature has prepared in the part of the water, until it is ripe and becomes another water; and it is the kidney of the genital between the white membrane that we mentioned earlier, and it is not anything other than a tumor.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness which occurs in the groin, due to which this matter is infused into that area, and sometimes it occurs due to a blow struck on the groin.
And this humidity has many colors, for its color is sometimes tending towards yellowish or blood-red, or it is red, or it is black and feces-like, or it is watery and whitish, and that is the most common.
And the signs by which it is known where this accumulation of water is in this area are: for if it is in the white cephala (head) that we mentioned, then the abscess is round, tapering slightly towards length, shaped like an egg, and the groin appears, because the humidity surrounds it from all sides.
And if the humidity is in the true fascia (a layer of fibrous tissue), then the abscess is round with a cleft like an egg, and for this reason it is thought to be another egg.
And if the humidity is between the cord of the groin and the white head, then press below the chin.
And if you want to know the color of the humidity, then press the color of the humidity in the abscess with a blunt probe, the shape of which is known; and according to what comes out on the tip of the probe, judge from that what it is inside.
Therefore, when we come to the treatment of it with iron (surgery), then it is appropriate to order the patient to be bled if that is possible for you, and sometimes empty their stomach.
And then let them be turned over onto their side for some reason and place a thick cloth beneath them.
And then place yourself on the left side of the patient and order the minister to be at their right, extending his rod (probe) to one or two fingers' breadths to the cord in the groin and the border of the mirror (umbilicus) of the belly.
And then take a broad spatula and cut the cord in the groin from the middle towards length near the pubic bone.
And make the incision according to right measure, equally distant from the line of the skin of the groin, until it reaches the white head (head of the abscess) and encompasses it.
And clean it out, and observe and be careful not to cut too deep, and your incision with which you clean it should be made in parts so that it is suspended by the largest and thinnest egg (abscess), and carefully examine the incision according to the quantity as much as possible.
And then pierce the white head full of water with a wide perforation and extract all the water.
And then separate between two lips of the incision with hooks and extend the white head (head of the abscess) towards the upper parts; and do not touch the cord in the groin, and cut into the white head in such a way as it is possible for you. And cut into it with its entirety or in pieces, and mainly its thin side, because if you do not examine the incision carefully, there is no certainty that the water will not return.
But if the egg protrudes from that outside of its cord during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the white head (head of the abscess), return it inside, and then join the two lips of the cord in the groin with suturing, and take care of it as for other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the egg corrupted by another disease, then it is necessary to cut the vessels that are over the fascia (suspensory ligament) and extract the egg, and take care of it as we mentioned.
But if the water is gathered in two parts (abscesses), then know that there are two hernias; therefore cut into that part as you did with the other one, and if it seems to you that it is one operation, then do it.
And then clean the blood, and introduce into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rose oil (oil of roses); and place another wool that you have soaked in wine and oil, spread it over both groins and the navel; and place doubled cloths and padding on top, and bind those with a linen bandage that is according to this shape:
And then let two cloths be pressed and filled with red wool according to this shape; and the extremities with which it is pressed should be made of cotton or wet wool, and they should be fastened with tension in the front of the underpants, and one of the extremities should take hold of the buttocks from inside to outside, and the second should take hold at the border of the pubic bone, and two extremities on both sides below the thighs, and two other extremities on both sides above the hips, and all the tension should be adjusted in the front of the underpants.
And sometimes this hernia is artificially treated with cautery instead of incision with iron (surgery); and it is that you take a subtle surgical knife and cut the cord in the groin with it, and ignite it as we have recommended until the white head containing the water is uncovered, and then you take the cautery according to this form: [The text describes the shape of the cautery but I couldn't understand it, it may be some specific tool or instrument from medieval medicine. If you want me to try to interpret it please let me know] And it is shaped like the Greek letter. (Alpha)
And then pierce with it (cautery) the white head, and ignite until all the humidity is expelled.
And then extend the white head with hooks, and clean it with hooks, and clean it with a subtle heated cautery; and cut into it as much as possible in order to eradicate all of it; and be careful that the fire does not touch the egg (abscess).
And know that this operation is more safe and less prone to bleeding, and better than an operation with incision. This passage is highlighting the advantages of using cautery over surgery in treating hernias, as it causes less bleeding, less risk of infection and faster recovery.
But if you have an abscess (apostema) at the time of incision or at the time of cautery, or bleeding, then it is necessary that you treat the condition that opposes you because of this, with treatment that is appropriate for it according to what is said.
But if the patient is fearful and does not hope for a second operation due to its horror, then administer perforation as we have recommended; and this is when you are certain, because of what we have said about the signs, that this hernia is watery (full of fluid).
And now it is necessary that you place the patient on an elevated seat, then pierce the abscess in its lowest part with a broad spatula, and place the perforation according to the length of the body.
And let the incision be wide enough to allow all the water to escape.
And then place cotton on the location, bind it and leave it, so that the remaining water runs out. And then take care of it until the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the evacuation of water at that time, then you should perforate it: and this is not done except because the white fascia in the wound orifice creates resistance and prevents the release of water, therefore, it is necessary to insert into the wound a probe or instrument with which water was extracted from hydrops patients, the shape of which is known; or apply pressure on the opposite side of the wound.
And know that water can return and accumulate again after several months or years; and when it does, then it should be perforated in the same manner, because the patient will thus pass his days (i.e., survive). This passage suggests that hernias may recur even after successful treatment, due to the buildup of fluid over time. In such cases, the physician should follow the same procedure as before, including making an incision and draining the fluid, to ensure the patient's well-being.
This is the end of this section, Capital LXIII, of this medieval medical text. It deals with the diagnosis and treatment of hernias, including surgical procedures, cauterization, and other methods for draining fluid from the affected area. The text emphasizes the importance of careful observation and assessment of the patient's condition, as well as the need to consider individual factors such as age, overall health, and level of fear or anxiety when choosing a treatment approach. The use of cauterization and perforation is recommended over more invasive surgical procedures in certain cases, due to their lower risk of bleeding, infection, and other complications. Overall, the text demonstrates the sophisticated understanding of anatomy, pathology, and surgical techniques that was available in medieval medical practice, and highlights the important role that observation, experience, and careful judgement played in the successful treatment of hernias and other conditions.
Capitolo LXIII: Incisioni sulla ernia carnosa e la sua cura.
It is important to note that in the section on this type of hernia, there is a fear of danger and harm, especially in more complicated cases. In my experience, it is often best to avoid surgery and opt for a less invasive approach, such as draining the fluid or using a support garment, in order to minimize risk and promote healing. Ultimately, the goal should always be to ensure the safety and well-being of the patient.
And I remember the operation on that hernia and the types of abscesses (apostemas) that can occur. The text suggests that a variety of abscesses can form in relation to this type of hernia, including those caused by infection or inflammation of the surrounding tissues. It is important for the physician to carefully assess the patient's condition and determine the appropriate course of treatment, taking into account any underlying medical conditions or factors that may increase the risk of complications. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the hernia and drain any abscesses, while in other cases, medication or other non-surgical treatments may be sufficient to manage the condition.
Therefore, I say that an abscess (apostemas) can form in the groin area of those whose genitals are weakened for many reasons: either due to acute sharp excess fluid that is infused into the groin or due to a blow to the area. This passage highlights how weakness in the groin area, whether caused by injury or other factors, can make individuals more susceptible to developing abscesses and hernias in this region. It also emphasizes the importance of addressing any underlying medical conditions or risk factors that may contribute to the development of these conditions.
The color of an abscess (apostemas) depends on the color of the affected tissue and is not necessarily associated with pain. It is a severe condition. This passage suggests that the appearance of an abscess may vary depending on the location and severity of the infection, but its presence should not be judged solely based on the level of pain experienced by the patient. A severe abscess can occur even in the absence of significant discomfort, and it is important for medical professionals to carefully evaluate any signs or symptoms that may indicate the presence of an infection.
A hard abscess (apostemas) is one that has become encapsulated and its color is dark, and it is not sensitive to touch. This type of abscess is more severe than a soft, tender one and may require surgical intervention to drain the pus and promote healing. The dark color of the abscess indicates the presence of dead tissue and bacteria, which can lead to further infection and complications if left untreated. It's important for physicians to assess the severity of an abscess and determine the appropriate course of treatment based on its size, location, and other factors.
And sometimes it is caused by entanglement of the veins and arteries or by inflammation of those same veins, which has already been felt, or by inflammation of the veins. This passage highlights that abscesses can be caused by various factors such as entanglement or inflammation of blood vessels. It is important for physicians to thoroughly examine and understand the underlying cause of an abscess in order to properly treat it and prevent future occurrences. In some cases, this may involve surgical intervention, while in others, medication or lifestyle changes may be sufficient.
But that which is caused by inflammation of the arteries can be recognized by the dispersion of the abscess when it is compressed with the fingers, and it is not advisable to touch it. This passage suggests that inflammation of the arteries (arteritis) can cause an abscess or swelling that disperses easily upon compression, indicating a more serious underlying condition. It is important to avoid touching or applying pressure to this type of abscess as it may exacerbate the inflammation and potentially lead to further complications. Proper diagnosis and treatment by a medical professional are crucial for addressing the root cause of the abscess and ensuring a successful recovery.
The swelling caused by venous inflammation should not be dispersed by any means, but rather compressed with the aforementioned.
It is possible that incision can be made on this type (of swelling) and on the surrounding flesh; for you should insert a retractor into the ligaments of the genitals, then stretch the skin towards the upper parts, extract the white cephalic vein, free the suspensory ligament of the vessels, and tie them. Then, insert the suspensory ligament more deeply than where you freed it from all sides of the cephalic vein parts.
Therefore, if the vein is already consolidated with those fleshy parts, it is necessary to extract the vein and make an incision there.
And if there is an adhesion in the cephalic region for some reason, or between what is between the vessels, then it is necessary to free all that adhesion and make a round incision there.
But if there is native flesh in the location of the adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary to cut everything that belongs to it and extract the vein as we have said.
And when your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and vinegar; and take care of it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
On the treatment of hernia that is in the groin.
A hernia is an abscess enveloped by some covering similar to a swelling with softening of the testicles, and it makes movement and exercise difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, there is fear due to what precedes it, which is a reminder (of the pain and complications).
However, it is necessary to say operation in the second case as in the first.
I say that it is necessary to make the patient lie on an elevated pillow; then pull the suspensory ligament of the testicles towards the lower parts; and pull the ligaments of the genitals with the aforementioned ties towards the rod; and hold those other ministers (assistants) that you have, and stretch them with strong extension.
And then make an incision with a broad, sharp spathula in a transverse direction into the vessels until they are exposed.
And then remove all parts as we have said in the extraction of hernia, which are in the temples.
And then place a needle in which there is double thread, and tie it at the beginning of the places where hernia occurs, and tie the other end at the back of them. And then make an incision in the middle location for a straight section according to the length of the body, and extract what has accumulated from the putrid and corrupted humors.
And then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds where there is a desire for healing to occur, so that the vessels which nourish one of the two testicles do not fall, for it is not harmful.
But if hernia occurs in all the vessels, then it is necessary to extract the testicles or that the testicles are cut off with the vessels because they are deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels, and that they become atrophied, or that they are removed so that they are not helpful for those.
Chapter 65.
On the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a section that occurs in the cephalic region extended over the abdomen from some of the intestines of the stomach, so that when these intestines come out of that rupture, they enter into it.
And this rupture is either of the cephalic region or from its absence, and these two types occur for many reasons: impact, coughing, shouting, lifting heavy objects, or similar things. [http://medieval-spanish.stanford.edu/13texts/torregiano/Torregiano\_13.html](http://medieval-spanish.stanford.edu/13texts/torregiano/Torregiano_13.html)
And the sign of this, when it is due to extension of the cephalic region, is that it occurs gradually over a long period of time and not suddenly, and it is an abscess that forms inside towards the preon because the cephalic region compresses the intestines.
And the sign of this, when it is due to section of the cephalic region, is that at the beginning it causes violent pain suddenly; and it appears as a diverse abscess below the apparent swollen area, and this is because of protrusion of the intestine, and the body is outside the cephalic region. [http://medieval-spanish.stanford.edu/13texts/torregiano/Torregiano\_13.html](http://medieval-spanish.stanford.edu/13texts/torregiano/Torregiano_13.html)
And sometimes the intestines are expelled with the membrane, and this is called an incarcerated intestinal hernia.
And sometimes it is formed with flatulence, and sometimes it occurs in a split intestine and becomes trapped there, and this causes great danger to the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain that worsens when pressed.
And in the treatment of the types of this illness with iron, there is fear because it is necessary to avoid injury in that area.
And the method of the operation for this is to command the patient to reposition the intestine with their hand towards the inner parts of its cavity if they obey its return, and then be covered with your hands and place them on their hips, and lift their legs.
And then stretch the cord that ties the cord of the testicles towards the upper parts, and make an incision in the entire length of the cord of the testicles; and then place two hooks on both sides of the section to open it with those hooks as needed.
And if the section is according to the amount that is possible for you so that the vein is expelled from it.
And then remove the covering of the cephalic region that is below the cord of the testicles, until the hard white part of each side of it is exposed.
And then insert your finger in what ties the testicle, in that which is between the white cephalic part, which is below the cord of the vein, and between the cephalic region itself; and separate it with the adhesion that is in the backside of the vein.
And then hold the cord of the testicles with your hand towards the outer parts, and extend the white cephalic part upwards with your left hand, and lift the vein with the cephalic region towards the location of the incision; and command your assistant to stretch the vein upwards, while you dissolve the adhesion that is behind with a complete solution.
And make sure with your fingers that there is no cause of the intestine wrapped in the hard white cephalic part. But if you find any cause in it, then pull that towards the lower abdomen.
And then make an incision in the area below the cord of the testicles for a section from which blood and healing flow as we have recommended in what we said before.
And then apply wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound; and administer the ligature that we recommended (and sometimes the white cephalic part is cauterized, which we said before causes fear of bleeding during the incision, because often this occurs); and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if healing is delayed, then apply hot water and place it on top until it falls off as we said before.
And take care of the wound with other treatments for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Chapter 66: On Ventral Hernia
In this type of hernia, I have not seen anyone who has been brave enough to attempt its cure using iron instruments.
And the first (doctors) said that it is made in the same way as we have recommended for the hernia that is in the groin; which is to tie off the veins near the incision with ease and then make an incision in the middle location around the abscess, until the veins fall.
And cure the wound in the way we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67
Chapter 67: On Disruption in the Intestines
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the sinews as we have said, and protrudes from the location.
The intestines should not be allowed to descend into the groin; and if they do, it should only be a little; and they will return upward in all cases.
But if this is prolonged, then a fissure must be made in the abdomen so that the intestines can descend into the abdomen; and this happens due to the stretching of the abdominal muscles which are in the sinews as we have said, which causes the abdominal muscles to stretch, become soft, and form an abscess and protrude.
And the treatment for this is with cautery as has been described earlier.
Sometimes it is cured with iron in this manner: the patient lies on their back between your hands and you dry the location of the rupture from the abscesses that protrude with a section along its length according to three fingers wide.
And then strengthen the white abdomen which is below the ribcage so that it becomes exposed.
And then take the rod and place it on the prominent location of the abdomen, and press it firmly against the patient's belly.
And then sew together the two prominent locations on the end of the rod of the abdomen, and bind one to the other with sutures.
And then extract the end of the rod without penetrating the abdomen completely, nor extend the belly or cause any other harm as you know in the treatment of intestinal hernias.
And then cure this with the treatment of wounds and clean it when you insert the fields, and restore the wound so that it heals and the area of the rupture is strengthened; for the abdomen contracts and does not allow the protrusion to be corrected.
And cautionery is better in this location, for it is closer to health.
Chapter LXVIII
On the softening of the groin area around the testicles.
Often the groin area around the testicles becomes soft in some men because the flesh between it is softened and this occurs due to neglect.
Therefore, it is necessary for the person responsible for treating this condition to make the patient lie on their back and pull up all the softened groin area over the natural groin and then sew together two lips of flesh with sutures.
And if desired, you can first sew the excess softened groin area with three or four stitches and firm sutures.
And then insert between the stitches, and then cure with the treatment of wounds until it heals and the fields fall off.
Chapter LXIX
On castration.
Know that in our religion, castration is forbidden; but it is necessary for me to mention it in this book, and the mention of it is not required except for two reasons, one of which is so that it is part of the doctor's knowledge when he is questioned about it, that he knows how to treat it if it occurs; and the other reason is that we often need castration of other animals for our livestock such as mules, oxen, pigs, and similar animals.
And so I say that castration is done in two ways: either by crushing or by cutting through to make an incision.
But in the method of castration by crushing, the procedure for the operation is to submerge the animal in hot water until its testicles become soft and loose and hang down. And then take hold of them with your hand until they are relaxed and do not appear under the skin.
But in the method of castration by incision and cutting, it is necessary to hold the animal and press its groin area with your left hand.
And then tie up the spermatic cord and make an incision on each testicle with a cut deep enough to process two of them.
And then suture any pustules that you have lanced. And do not leave anything on the abdomen, but instead apply a light bandage which is above the wound.
And this method of castration by crushing is better because it leaves no residue from the testicles and allows the animal to continue desiring coitus.
And then cure the wound until it heals.
Chapter LXX
On the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men can occur in two ways: one is that a space appears in the groin area of the testicles, between two testicles, and this looks like a woman's labia.
And sometimes the urethra that is in the groin area of the testicles becomes blocked.
But in women, it is a different type: and that is when the labia of the woman above the pubic bone looks like two testicles of a man slightly minimized at the outer end, just like the scrotum and testicles of a man.
And the treatment is of three kinds, two for men and one for women. And it is necessary to suture the swollen flesh until the inflammation subsides and then cure those with the treatment of other wounds.
And in the second type of men where the urethra is in the groin area of the testicles, there is neither a cure nor an operation for it.
Chapter XXI
On eyelashes and protruding flesh caused by women.
Eyelashes that are slightly prominent due to natural causes can be corrected with proper care and attention, but sometimes in some women they become so prominent that they spread out like those of men and even interfere with sexual intercourse.
Therefore, it is necessary to hold the excess eyelashes with your hand or tweezers and cut them.
And do not delay in carrying out the incision, especially in the region of the bladder, to prevent bleeding.
Then treat that wound with care until it is healed.
Newly born flesh is the flesh that forms in the womb and fills it up, which easily comes out in parts similar to a tail (and for this reason I will call this condition "tailed disease"); therefore, we must incise in the same way as we do for an abscess, and care for it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
On the treatment of pleurisy.
Pleurisy is when a woman's chest is not pierced, or has a small hole in it. And it can be either natural or accidental.
An accidental pleurisy is caused by a disease that has occurred beforehand, and this can be brought about either by flesh that has not been properly adjusted or by a thin or dense substance.
An accidental pleurisy can be caused by an infection in the mother's womb, inflammation of the ribs, or a swelling in the upper or lower part of the body, and it can prevent sleep, physical exertion, and childbirth, and often delays menstruation.
The diagnosis of this condition can be made by observing the mother's symptoms, if they are obvious, then note them down. But if they are not obvious, then examine the patient using your hands or a probe.
But if the obstruction is due to a thin substance and is located near the two lips (presumably referring to the labia of the female genitalia), then you should apply pressure and break it open.
And place your fingers on the two lips and then gently press them with both hands using your fingertips.
And have the woman lie on her back with her buttocks raised and legs spread apart, then use gentle but firm pressure to open up the two lips until the thin substance is broken through and the obstruction is cleared.
Then take some wool and soak it in oil, place it on the area and cover it with a cloth to prevent the incision from becoming infected.
But if the substance is thick and dense, then you must make an incision with a spatula or a leaf of myrtle.
But if the obstruction is due to a tumor or swelling, then use a hook to suspend it and make an incision there.
And use these medications that stop bleeding without causing pain, such as henbane, dragon's blood, and alum mixed with egg white.
And administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not close too quickly and become infected.
And keep the wound open for several days, applying a poultice made from the dry powder of the plant.
And then treat it with the usual treatment for healing until it is healed.
And sometimes it happens that other flesh is born in the womb, and then you must proceed in this manner. But if it is caused by a hard abscess in the womb, then you should not use any iron instruments at all on the abscess.
Chapter 73.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids and piles and red botches that occur in the female genitalia.
Hemorrhoids are a prolapse of dilated veins in which continuous bleeding occurs, and when they become chronic and develop ulcers.
And I have already said in the classification what their species are and what their signs are, and I will now say which ones receive treatment and which ones do not.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and ulcers, when they are inside the womb and do not appear to the senses, should not be treated with iron instruments in such cases.
But those that are in the opening of the womb and can be felt with the senses are those that should be treated.
And it is necessary to place the woman in a hot bath and then extend her thighs with forceps or rough cloth, and cut those hemorrhoids with scissors.
And then apply powder to those areas using the blood flow from one of the incisive powders without pain, such as henbane and similar to it.
And then wrap her feet in bandages for an hour, and then place her in cold water.
And if there is persistent bleeding, then make a concoction of willow and corn silk and walnuts and similar things.
And then take flour made from barley and mix it with honey, vinegar, and wine, and make a poultice with that and apply it to the patient's back.
And if the bleeding has stopped, that's good; and if not, then use two suction cups, and make incisions in the nipples.
And then take wool and soak it in juice from clover or juice from ragwort or juice from vervain with diluted wine, and attach it to the affected area. Then cure the area with ointment until it is healed.
And cure the wound until it heals.
Chapter 74.
Of perforation of a wound in the mother.
Many types of abscesses occur in the mother, such as cancer, hard abscess, ulcers, abscesses, herpes, fistulas, hemorrhoids, ruptures, and other abscesses. I have already mentioned these illnesses and their types and symptoms, and the cures for them in the previous section.[/PI>
And it is necessary for me to mention in this treatise the boil that comes in the mother when one of the abscesses bursts and if you want to know how the operation of it with iron is done.
Therefore, you should consider if the pain of the abscess at its onset is sharp with percussion and flexion and fever, and sometimes it reddens and emits pus above it. If so, then do not perform perforation of it, but instead cure it by helping the maturation process until the acuteness of the symptoms subsides.[ \>
And then you should have the woman sit on a chair with two seats; and recline her back on her side and adjust her legs below the lower part of her belly, and spread her thighs apart, and place her arms below her knees, and bind each one appropriately.
Then the midwife should follow with the lancet and administer the instrument that opens the orifice of the mother, the form of which will come in those cases that are made later.[ \>
And it is necessary when you want to administer this instrument that you insert with the edge the prepuce of the mother (vulva) of the woman, and the part that enters the mother should not be more than the width of the prepuce and gentle to the patient. [ > But if the instrument is larger than the width of the prepuce of the mother, then it is necessary that you place pulvills (small pieces of soft material) on the surface of the prepuce of the mother so that the entire instrument is prevented from entering the prepuce of the mother.
And it is necessary that you place the grease (or possibly "fever" in this context) that runs on the surface of the lancet blade above and that the one who administers holds the instrument and turns the grease (or fever) until the orifice of the mother is opened.
And when the incision is made, and it is touched with the hand and is bleeding and wet, then it is necessary that you dry it with a piece of cloth or sponge.
And when the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place a wick soaked in rose oil or oil with styptic properties on the wound; and place the bandage on the incision in the prepuce of the mother.
And place outside the mother and on top of the bandage (or possibly "belly" in this context) clean wool soaked in water with crushed marshmallows added to it.
And then it should be treated with ointment for two days, using an amount that is appropriate until it is healed.
And sometimes the mother and the wound are washed with water and honey, and also with water in which rosemary or long-leafed aristolochia has been boiled, and then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep in the mother's womb, then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it with iron and instead cure it with what has been said in the previous section.
Capital LXXV.
To teach midwives how fetal beings are treated when born according to an unnatural form (monstrosity).
It is necessary that the midwife recognizes in the beginning the form of a normal childbirth through its signs, and this is that when you see the woman pushing at the lower parts and desires to smell the air, and she is relieved by what is above her (the baby), and hastens the expulsion of the fetus, then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and it is the expulsion of it upon its head, and the afterbirth attached to or hanging from the umbilical cord.
Therefore, when you see those signs, it is necessary to compress the woman's belly so that the fetus descends easily because when it emerges on its head, give her the afterbirth, and clean it of those excesses with good cleaning.
But if this birth is unnatural and blameworthy, because when the fetus emerges on its feet and its body is emerging in front of its head and its legs or one arm are outside (or "at the pe" in the original text, which is unclear), or it emerges with the head and one arm or the belly first, and turns very quickly onto its neck (or "col" in the original text), resembling those unnatural forms (of monstrosities).
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be knowledgeable and skilled in all of those cases (of childbirth), and that she avoids errors and deception.
And I have shown the entire figure of those (cases), and what signs are in them, so that they can be interpreted by that and stand for them.
When the baby has emerged on its head due to natural labor, and it is heavy on the woman and makes her delivery difficult, and sometimes its strength is already weakened, then do this: have her sit up or have her hold (the baby), and evaporate the mucus from it with a fig of fenugreek and warm oil.
And then the midwife should insert her small, split spatula between the woman's teeth and use it to detach the afterbirth or cut it with her fingernail until the watery substance in it is expelled. And press on the woman's belly until the afterbirth is expelled.
But if it does not come out (the afterbirth), then the woman should be treated with a poultice of powdered myrtle and ground fenugreek seeds mixed with crushed chickpeas.
And approach the patient, and tell them to tightly compress their chest and make them sneeze using some method; and keep their mouth and nose covered for an hour, for this will cause the foul air to be expelled immediately.
And if the two hands of the patient are initially trembling, then you must slowly and gradually bring them back to normal. But if they do not obey the treatment, then place a woman on a stool and lift the patient's legs up, and have the stool knocked against the ground; and make sure that the woman does not fall during this concussion.
And if the hands are not returned to their normal position and the patient dies, then make an incision in the hands and extract the foreign object or bind the arms to your body with a cloth and pull it out gently, for this will cause the foul air to be expelled.
When the fetus is on its feet, then you must press gently on its back to turn it over, and gradually knead it and massage it, and then take one of its legs and slowly stretch it out.
But if it has become stuck between the thighs, then tell the patient to push, and make them sneeze using some method, for this will cause the fetus to be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled using the methods described, then gradually return the fetus to its normal position until you have restored its natural shape, for this will then cause it to be expelled with a gentle force.
And if all of the above methods have failed, then take some althea root and dissolved gum, and grind them together in a mortar with a strong force, and apply it to the woman's cervix and the lower abdomen of the patient. And perform this procedure with warm water, until you have reached the hypochondria region (the area just above the hips).
And when you see that the patient's external parts have been soothed, then apply to them a fumigation of myrtle and place it under their nose. And after an hour of fumigation, then place the patient on a stool and make them sneeze and clear their throat, and then lift them up and apply gentle pressure to the lowest part of their abdomen, for the fetus will soon be expelled.
Delivery of a fetus lying horizontally with one of its arms extended. If the arm cannot be guided back into the correct position, then lift the woman's hips and make her change position.
If changing position does not help, then have her lie on her back and apply strong pressure to her hips with repeated blows or shocks, while also administering soothing remedies and recommending mucilaginous foods.
Once the delivery is complete, place the woman on a stool and focus on guiding the arm back into its proper position, then massage the fetus gently to return it to its natural shape. Encourage the woman to sneeze and instruct her to push until the afterbirth is expelled.
Delivery of a fetus with its arms extended and its back facing its mother's spine. The midwife should hold the fetus and gently turn it while easing it out.
And once it has emerged and as soon as it is possible, place it on the woman's abdomen as we have recommended, using oil and mucilaginous substances.
And then you should encourage the woman to breastfeed gradually, and once that is done, place her on a stool with her legs hanging down and slightly inclined to one side, and apply gentle pressure to help expel any remaining placenta. Encourage her to sneeze to aid in this process. Delivery of a prepared fetus lying on its side.
When it is time to cut the umbilical cord according to this method, pay attention and then proceed to make a small incision with your fingernail until it is fully drained of fluid.
If the fetus is hanging by its face or neck, then make an incision with a lancet to ensure that it is not constricted and can be safely delivered.
And then gently push the fetus back into the birth canal until it is in the correct position, and instruct the woman to take deep breaths to help expel it with a gentle force, if God wills it.
Delivery of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born several times, and sometimes even three or four, but this is rare and happens late; but it is due to natural causes and they are not alive.
And it is said that in the case of multiple fetuses, sometimes one is attached to the other by a membrane and must be separated from it by cutting through the connecting tissue at the navel. Each fetus will have its own set of ligaments, and some may be delivered naturally with gentle force, while others may require more difficult or non-standard methods as we have recommended.
And if the abscesses are difficult to mature and reach what we said about unnatural figures, then you cure them as we have recounted.
And if the midwife skillfully does this with ease and subtlety, and with delay, and acts according to every figure as it is prepared by her cunning, leading to health.
The remembrance of what is formed in the uterus from embryos and is aborted.
Some women have multiple pregnancies, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or even ten fetuses, and I have verified that one woman aborts and gives birth to five, while another delivers all ten, a result brought about by the calculations of wise men.
And all of this falls under the knowledge/science of the midwife because she easily recognizes a similar appearance in that, and therefore she opposes it with what is appropriate.
Chapter seventy-six.
On the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you cure the dead fetus with what we have said in the division of medicine and it does not come out, and you are forced to use surgery with your hand, then it is necessary that you consider if the woman has good health and does not suffer from any of the accidents for which there is a fear of loss/risk.
Then it is necessary for the woman to be positioned on her back on a bed, and her head should be tilted downwards and her thighs raised upwards.
And the minister should hold her from both sides or be tied to the bed in order to prevent her body from extending during the extraction of the fetus.
And then you should moisten the mouth of the woman with warm oils and with marshmallow mucilage, as well as with fenugreek and flax seeds.
And then the midwife should anoint her hand with those oils and mucilages, and then gently insert her hand into the uterus, and then carefully search for the place in which she can hook her fingers onto the fetus.
And place incisions there: then consider if the fetus is positioned to descend upon the mother's abdomen, and in that case, place the forceps on the heels of the baby, or on its neck, or in its mouth, or on the palate, or below the beard, or on the baby's shoulder blades, or under the ribs.
But if it is descending toward the baby's feet, then in the perineum or in the middle of the ribcage.
And it is necessary to hold the forceps with the right hand and place the curve of them in the location that is between the fingers of the left hand, and gently insert the forceps into one of those locations that we have mentioned, until reaching the cause of the problem.
And then place and hold another forceps or the third one, if necessary, in apposition to it, so that there is traction and not just extension according to its natural shape.
And it is better in every way, so that the incision may be eased as well as when a tooth is extracted.
And it is necessary in that area between them that extension be softened; and if any part of it is retained, then the midwife must anoint some of her mentioned remedies with oil and introduce them there and rotate them with what is retained.
Therefore, if the part of the baby is prolapsed, then the forceps should be rotated into the location that is more open; and do so until the entire baby has been delivered.
But if one hand is outside before the other and it is not possible to reduce it due to its constriction, then a cloth must be wrapped around it; and then pull it out until it is fully delivered, and make an incision in it at the joint of the hand or the fingers.
And it is also necessary to do the same for the other hand and both feet.
But if the baby's head is large or there is constriction in the delivery, or if there is water trapped in its head, then it is necessary to insert the spatula-like instrument and split the head open and extract the water, or else use an instrument called an "alundat," which has a similar shape to the other instruments described in this text.
Similarly, it should be done if the baby has a naturally large head: and then it is necessary to make an incision in it with a scalpel, or else use an instrument called an "alundat" as we have mentioned; and then extract the bones using forceps.
And if the head has emerged but is constricted at the shoulders, then it should be split open in order to release the fluid in the feet.
But if there are no complications and the delivery is not obstructed, then you should make an incision in the head as soon as it is possible for you to do so.
And if the lower abdomen of the mother is affected by an abscess or edema, then you should puncture it to release the fluid that has accumulated there.
But if the baby is positioned feet-first (breech), then the traction required to deliver it will be lighter and its descent towards the mother's birth canal will be easier.
But if the baby is stuck with its belly and feet pressed against the mother's pelvis, then you should extract the cloth that you have wrapped around your hand, and make an incision in the mother's abdomen and pelvis to release what is inside.
But if the other limbs are obstructed and the head is turned back, then the midwife should insert her left hand; but if the mother's vagina is narrow, then she should insert her hand into the labia and search for the head with it, and pull it towards the mother's vagina. Then she should insert one or two forceps into it, and pull it out with those.
But if the mother's vagina is constricted due to an abscess caused by a stone, then it should not be pressed or forced open; instead, moist and fatty substances should be administered. And administer poultices, and follow the patient with warm and moist treatments.
And if the abscess is on his side, then if possible, it should be lanced, and administered what we have said in the case of a living person.
And if that is not possible, then make an incision in layers and extract it.
And it is necessary to remove all causes of inflammation from the wound.
And when you have completed your entire operation, then administer what we have said about the treatment of abscesses that arise from wounds.
And if bleeding occurs, then apply stiptic waters and administer the other treatment.
I have seen a woman in whose belly a dead fetus was, and then another pregnancy occurred over that same location, and the second fetus also died. An abscess occurred in your belly for a long time, and it became so swollen that pus burst out, and the arm began to swell as well.
I was called upon to treat him, and I treated him for a long time, but the wound did not heal.
Then I applied strong-attraction plasters to him for certain causes, and extracted a bone from him, and after several days, another bone came out; and I was greatly surprised that there could be bones in the belly.
Then I considered that they were the bones of the dead fetus.
Then I investigated the wound and extracted many bones from it, the woman being in a state of great anxiety, but she lived for a long time afterwards, with only a small part of her arm remaining.
And I did not find it strange, because in this matter there is science and assistance for the physician who skillfully administers treatment with his hands.
Of the forms of the instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
The shape of a lancet with which the womb is opened:
This is the shape of a stretcher in which the limbs are held, with two handles at both ends of two pieces of wood. However, this handle must be thinner than the stretcher and made either of ivory or boxwood.
And the width of each piece of wood should be two fingers and the edge of each should be one finger wide, and the length of each should be a palm and a half; and in place of the two pieces of wood there should be two joints of the same piece of wood that are already fastened, the length of which is a little more than a palm, and the width of each should be two fingers or slightly more.
And these two additions should be inserted in the mouth of the womb so that it can be opened with them when you turn the prescribed handles.
Another form similar to it, but thinner and lighter:
It should be made of boxwood or ebony, similar to forceps. However, at the end of it there are two additional parts, and the length of these additional parts is a palm, and the width of each is two digits.
And when you want to open the womb with these, then have the woman lie on her back with her legs apart and her buttocks raised. Then open your hand with the instrument like you would do with forceps, according to how much of the opening of the womb you want to make, until the midwife does what she wants.
The shape of a lancet that the ancients called:
The shape of an instrument used to push the fetus:
The shape of a compressor with which the large head is contained.
And it is similar to forceps, with teeth at the end, and sometimes this instrument is made long like forceps according to this shape, with teeth like a saw that are used for cutting and containing. The shape of a small compressor:
The shape of a hook with a spine:
The shape of a hook with two spines:
The shape of a spatula having two ends used to cut off the head:
The shape of two broad spatulas:
All of these instruments should be practiced with and as their species are multiplied and prepared by the craftsmen, the lighter they will be for their operation and more useful they will be for people according to their quantity.
And do not be afraid to use these instruments whenever necessary, because their necessity cannot be avoided.
On the extraction of abscesses:
When the abscess is retained during childbirth, it is necessary to command the woman to hold her breath, and then have her sneeze with caution, and place your hand on her mouth and nostrils; if it comes out by itself, that's good.
If not, then take a sponge and make a hole in it, put inside it herbs that are wet with the mouth of the womb, such as chamomile, rue, anise, camomile, Arabic spikenard, cinnamon wood, and storax. All of these herbs or some of them should be submerged in water in the sponge, and then place it over the fire.
And then place a reed cannula in the mouth of the womb and keep it inside so that the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
And then induce her to sneeze as we have said, and the abscess will come out quickly.
But if this treatment does not work and the abscess does not come out, then order the midwife to dip her left hand in sesame oil or marshmallow ointment, and then insert it into the abscess cavity and search for it with her fingers. Once she has found it, then gently pull on it little by little, taking care not to tear the membranes of the womb. Beforehand, make sure that the patient's right and left sides are even (symmetrical).
And if the mother's mouth is obstructed, we have already recommended the treatment with emetic (sternutation) and medication for the pain with herbs.
But if it is not expelled with all the recommended causes, then be careful not to repeat the process of abstraction. Instead, make sure that what comes out of her mouth from the mother goes to the woman's thigh and then cauterize it with ointment and tetrafarmacon (a type of medical salve). This will cause it to rot and dissolve in a few days and be expelled.
But when it begins to rot, it will cause harm to the patient's head and stomach, and then it is necessary to administer sub-fumigations and appropriate treatments for this.
But the ulcers of the Ancients were already treated with sub-fumigation of nitric acid and dried figs.
The form of an instrument with which the woman is sub-fumigated should be for the retention of menstruation and secondines (afterbirth):
It should be made of glass or earthenware.
And the thin end should be placed in the woman's vagina and the wide end above the fire, and the sub-fumigation should be placed on top of the coals.
And keep it in place until the sub-fumigation is consumed and then replace it with another one.
On the treatment of an unperforated child's bottom (rectal area).
The mouths of infants are sucking and their bottoms (rectal area) are not perforated, which is subtle and blocked (closed). Therefore, it is the midwife's responsibility to perforate that blockage with her finger; and if not, then perforate it with a sharp spatula, but be careful not to touch the artery.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil over it (the perforated area); and treat it with an appropriate ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it will become blocked again, then insert a cannula in the tract for several days and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
And sometimes the anus becomes blocked due to consolidation from inflammation or abscess; in this case, it is necessary to incise that consolidation and treat it with what we have said about treatment and lead. (plom = lead)
On the treatment of fistulas that occur afterwards (develop later).
The fistulas that occur in the lower part, below, are knots and thickenings which occur near the anus or in the space of one side.
"And it is a fistula or many."
"And when that knot is old and has run out of wet and white putrefied substance or fine powder, some of these fistulas have penetrated."
"And those that penetrate are known by what comes out of them through the exit and flatulence; and sometimes the patient uses an exit, and it is very easy for worms to come out."
"And some of these fistulas, in the space, penetrate into the bladder and into the flesh of the penis; and some of them penetrate into the joint of the thigh and into the groin."
"And what distinguishes a penetrating fistula from a non-penetrating one is that you insert your finger into the anus and carefully introduce a thin piece of glass or metal into the fistula where there is no tortuousity."
But if there is tortuousity in that area, then carefully insert a thin probe made of lead or horsehair until you feel it with your finger.
And if you do not feel it (the probe) at all or cannot proceed with the passage due to any cause of evacuation, such as stool, worms, or flatulence, as we have mentioned, then know that it is non-penetrating, and so turn your attention to its treatment.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the flesh of the penis, then its significance is the discharge of urine from it and the prevention of that until the place with medicine is healed.
But if it is penetrating into the joint of the thigh or into the bone and causes pain in the area around it, then its symptom is that when you insert a probe into it, if there is no tortuousity within the bone, there will be pain in the area around it; and pus will always come out of it; and no medicine will work on it, nor can it be healed with ointment.
And in all cases of penetrating fistulas, there is no complete cure, and the treatment for them is hard work and futility on the part of the foolish doctors who attempt it.
But in those that are not penetrating and not old, healing with iron is expected, according to what I have recommended and proven.
And the patient should lie on their back with their hands under their head and raise their legs in the air, with their buttocks inclined towards their stomach, and then insert a probe made of lead or glass if there is twisting in the fistula until you can determine where the probe goes.
And if you feel the patient around the anus, then you must insert your finger into the anus.
And if you feel in your finger the probe already inserted and discovered penetrating, or something else between your finger and the fistula or flesh, then you know for certain that it is penetrating; and so do not work on it, because it cannot be healed, as we have said.
However, some people say that it is healed in some old men.
And the medication by which healing is expected in it (the fistula) is that you light a fine cautery according to the width of the fistula, as has been described before, and insert the burning cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat this two or three times until you know that all the diseased flesh around the fistula has been burned away, similar to a bird's feather quill.
And then cure it with hot compresses wrapped in a cloth until all the burned flesh has healed, and then cure it with medicines that promote tissue growth and consolidation. If it is healed, that's good; but if not, then it will never be healed by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters but does not penetrate inside your finger which is in the anus, and between that and the probe there is a thin layer of flesh or membrane, and sometimes the fistula appears on the surface of the skin, then dry out the skin starting from the beginning of the fistula with the probe. Dry it out using the probe until the drying reaches the location where the end of the probe is in the fistula, and then use the probe to release and remove the blockage in the fistula.
And then clean the fistulated flesh which is similar to a feather quill of a bird and leave no residue of any cause.
But if blood flows instead of pus when you insert the instrument and perform the operation on those tissues, then you must burn it with a hot iron or an acute medicine because cauterization with fire has two good effects: namely, the burning of those diseased tissues and the cutting off of the blood flow by drying up the moisture.
And then cure it with hot compresses wrapped in a cloth or a piece of linen until the wound is healed, and then cure the wound with hard-skin-generating and consolidating ointments.
And such medicines, which have astringent and drying properties; when they are used, the injury is restored and healed, and there is no fear of recurrence.
But if the fistula has already penetrated deep into the rectum of the anus and is extending from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and examine it with that.
And therefore, if you find the opening and between you and it is an obstacle of pus or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then it should not be operated on but rather treated with trust and hope.
This condition can be treated in one of three ways: by cauterizing the opening as we have said; or by drying it out until you are able to reach the cavity, so that you can introduce the necessary treatment; and do not dry it out too much, so as not to damage the muscle that holds in the intestines, and cause involuntary discharge from the patient; and heal it with what we have said, for it will easily be healed. Or by removing the obstacle and cleaning out the pus that has formed within, as we have said, either with your finger or with another sharp instrument, and then clean the fistulous flesh in the area where you can make an incision; and then try to heal the entire wound with an incision, and if the opening of the wound does not close, and the fistula remains open at the end of the anus, it will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula ends in this way: when you insert your finger into the fistula, it is located near the surface of the body around the edge of the anus, and then take hold of a blunt extremity, similar to a needle for preparing hearts in this form:
and insert it into the sheath of pus or around it, and then insert your finger coated with pus into the fistula until you reach its cavity.
But if it has penetrated near the edge of the anus, then remove the sheath from the opening, and insert your finger into the anus, and extract the end of the sheath and align both ends, pulling on each one, leaving it in place for a day or two. And when you reinsert the sheath into the flesh, pull it tightly so that the flesh between the two ends of the sheath is cut and falls away.
And then heal the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
But if the opening of the fistula is not deep enough, then make it deeper using any means available to you, but not so much that you damage the muscle; and then heal it until it is healed.
The shape of a pointed spatula, with which the fistula is opened: its curvature is very sharp and the other end is not sharp, so that you do not damage anything unnecessarily, as sometimes happens.
Regarding the suture of hemorrhoids where blood is flowing from their incision.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are inside the anus like charcoal, or they resemble lumps of fat. And they can be small or large, and blood flows from them continuously, and they are one or many, and they protrude from the anus, and at their extremities.
But those that protrude from the anus are of low moisture content, from which clear water or a small amount of blood with continuous flow, and they are of the same color as the body.
And the treatment for those that are inside the anus is to instruct the patient to sit and apply pressure until the anus protrudes and the hemorrhoids become visible to you. Then you should prepare yourself and hold on to the patient's cheeks with your fingers or with your nails, and then cut the hemorrhoids along their edges.
But if the hemorrhoids are too moist and soft for you to hold on to with your fingers, then take a rough cloth or a piece of leather or a woolen cloth, and pull them out with your fingers, and then cut them along their edges and sprinkle some powdered cautery over the wound, so that they will heal without the need for cauterization; or cauterize them as described in the chapter on cauterization. And then heal those with the same treatment until they are healed.
But if the anus does not respond to pressure, then use a suppository with a small bite on it, and wash it with water that is in the anus, so that it will easily come out when the patient applies pressure.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then the cause is simple: you can either take hold of them with your nails or use forceps to cut them, and then heal them as we have said until they are healed.
And if there is an incision, it is necessary to suture the hemorrhoids in this way: take a sheath of pus and insert it into a needle, then pull the hemorrhoids up to their bases and insert the needle into the edge of the other part, and wrap the ends of the sheath around the lower part of the needle, laterally; and tighten the hemorrhoid with strong tension, and then remove the needle.
Do this to all of them, but leave one open and do not close it, so that the excess blood can flow from it.
And then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or wax on the anus, and place it over the anus and instruct the patient to rest. And then leave it in place until it falls out by itself, and when it has fallen out, heal the wound with ointment or other treatment until it is healed.
And when they are old and not responsive to treatment, then it is necessary to open them with the point of a spatula or your nail until they become moist and the dry scab on top falls off, which prevents healing; and then heal them until they are consolidated.
Then you should open them with a sharp instrument until they bleed and are scraped clean, and then heal them until they are healed.
Know that an abscess is called a "nail" because it resembles a round knob the color of the skin, and it can appear anywhere on the body but is most common in the lower parts of the legs and feet, and its treatment involves lancing it to release the pus.
And so it is necessary to make an incision in the circumference of the "nail" and drain it with forceps or clamps, and then remove it from its root; and then heal the wound.
And if you wish, you can cauterize the wound as described in its chapter.
A wart is a small, rough, round, fistulous protuberance on the surface of the skin, and many times they occur in children's hands.
The treatment for warts is to cut or scrape them open with a sharp instrument, or to remove them by tying a string around the base and leaving it until the wart falls off. And if you wish, you can cauterize it with heat or an acidic substance, as we have said.
A "formica" (which means ant in Latin) is a small, swollen or fistulous lump on the surface of the body that extends into the flesh and causes a stinging sensation when touched, similar to a bite from an ant. It can be found anywhere on the body but is particularly common on the head and face.
The treatment for a "formica" is to take a quill from a goose or a vulture, and make it strong, then place it over the ant until it contains the circumference of the ant; and then rotate your hand with the quill inside until you cut into what is in the circuit of the ant, and place it deep in the flesh, and then remove the ant from its root.
And if you want, do this with an eram (brass) or iron cannula in the following way:
The upper part of the cannula should be fine and blunt (not piercing), wrapped in such a way that the impression on the finger is dulled and the rotation of it is smooth.
And if you wish, you can cauterize the ant as described in the section on cauterizing abscesses in the chapter on cautery.
Here are some of the forms that medical instruments used for administering enemas can take:
Sometimes, an enema is administered using a vessel made of silver, lead, or brass that has been melted or hammered into shape. The size and shape of the instrument used will depend on the patient's needs, with smaller instruments used for children and those with weak or sore bottoms. Small enema vessels are also recommended for patients who experience pain during the procedure.
Here is the form of a large enema vessel (or "cristeri"):
The top of the cannula where the bag is attached should be wide and have a distinct marking indicating where the bag should be attached, as described here:
And the lower end of it, which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt (that is, not sharp) and tapering towards the end; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the width of the holes should correspond to the thickness of the rays, and slightly larger.
And let the bag be where the medications of animal bladder or sheep wool are placed, and its size be one palm.
And let it be pierced with many holes as it is rolled up; and the size of the space between the holes should be the thickness of a finger.
Then insert into those holes strong gall bladder extract, of which there should be ten or so; and attach it to the bag; and when the bag is placed on the affected area, make sure it is tightly fastened at the top of the patient's head between two distinguishing marks with a strong constriction, and tie each hole with it. The quality of tying it is that you fill the bag with medicine, which should be warmed according to the patient's tolerance; and make sure it is not too hot or too cold.
Then let the patient be placed on their back, and lift their legs and place a cushion or pillow under them. Then apply oil, egg white, or fenugreek mucilage to the exterior of the cautery tool, and gently insert it into the anus with ease. Then have the assistant take the bag and squeeze it with both hands, forcefully expressing its contents into the intestine through the hole in the bag until all of the medicine has been evacuated. Then remove the bag and have the patient stand up, leaning against the wall for support.
And if the medicine forces him to urinate, let him do so as much as he can; and if he sleeps with it for the entire night, it is even more helpful.
But if you tie it in cases of abdominal effusion and urinary retention, then you should repeat the cautery until it is healed.
And if hemorrhoids or abscesses are present in the anus, then let the tying be very subtle and gentle, using the same kind of ties used for infants.
On the treatment of wounds.
I have already said in the division of wound treatment what is necessary for this book, and now I will say the treatment of these with my hands and with medicines as appropriate.
Therefore I say that wounds are diverse according to the cause of the wound and the location on which the wound is located.
And the causes by which wounds are often made include falling from a height, cuts from a sword or knife, piercing with a spear, staff, or arrow, or other similar causes.
But wounds on the parts of the body are also diverse, such as a wound that occurs on the head, neck, chest, stomach, hip, and other similar places on the limbs.
And I am now recommending the treatment for certain wounds, so that you can apply this reasoning and rule to other wounds as well.
And I will begin with simple wounds of the head, as the memory of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head and it is not a fracture, then consider: if it was caused by falling from a height or similar, and if the skull has been crushed only slightly, and it is a large wound, and you fear that an abscess may form, then you should quickly perform venesection (the act of opening a vein to release blood) on the cephalic vein (located in the arm), without delay. And extract some blood according to the patient's strength, but not more if there is no other reason prohibiting venesection, especially if the blood that has come out from the wound is scant.
And let venesection be opposite to the wounded part, and take care that the patient avoids fullness, wine, and heavy foods.
But if any cause prohibits from the minimum (venesection), then let food intake be reduced and do not approach meat or wine.
And place over the wound if an abscess has formed, cut it open and apply oil mixed with rose petals or wine that has been made sticky (coagulated).
But if you are sure that an abscess has not formed, then place over the wound, if it is fresh and still bleeding, with a small powder of the kind I will recommend later.
But if the air has already changed (i.e., the wound has begun to heal), then place on it some ointments until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or has been caused by a sword or similar, and its lips have not been brought together with stitches as I will recommend in the chapter on stitching, then bring them together with stitches as I will recommend on suture techniques.
But if the wound has exposed bone and brain tissue, but is not retaining any fragments, only a small amount of support, then incise it and cure the wound with medicines, restore the flesh in place of the skull, and command the patient to avoid foods that are heavy or difficult to digest until they have healed.
And if you find putrefaction in the skull that does not adhere to the bone, then you should cut away all of it and remove it, and then cure it (the wound).
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood can flow, and it has not been stopped by medicines, then you must look for the artery, and if you find it uncut, then you should cut it with a scalpel or tie it; and if necessity requires that what we have said does not work, then you should cauterize until the bleeding stops.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then the cause of them is light, so you should powder over it this powder, which will solidify before the air changes (i.e., the wound heals), preventing any infections from forming.
And the method of making this powder is as follows: take one part oil of crushed roses, two parts dragon's blood resin, and three parts unburnt chalk; mix them together thoroughly and sift them, then fill the wound with it and constrict it with a good constriction until it adheres well to the wound and is coagulated by the blood.
And then you should strengthen it above with stitches and leave it alone until the wound is no longer swollen or infected, as the medicine will not be effective if the stitches are removed before the wound has healed.
And sometimes it is sufficient to use only crushed rose petals when crushed roses and dragon's blood are not available to you.
And this method is also used in large wounds when it is appropriate to place it on them and keep them tight, and these are fresh wounds with their own blood, which the air has not yet altered.
But if the air has altered them, and especially in summertime, then it is not appropriate to use this powder. Instead, cure those wounds with what we have mentioned, such as placing ointments on them or using poultices made of flour and water mixed with honey until they dry up; and then heal those wounds with the other treatments until they are healed.
But if there is a fracture in the wound and it is small, then you should extract that with gentle force.
And I have said the treatment for head fractures in what is poisonous (i.e., dangerous).
Of the wounds of the neck.
But if the wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment compared to wounds of the head when they are simple.
But if the nerves or arteries in the neck have been cut, then if it is nerves, there is no need to sew them up but rather avoid treatment that causes strong coagulation, such as using zinc and quicklime (calcium oxide), which are known as vitriol and similar substances, so as not to damage the nerves and cause contraction. And do not place anything cold on the wound, for the substance of nerves is sensitive and its connection to the brain is delicate, which is the control center of all members.
And if it is that light medicines are used for the cure, such as warm water baths, sometimes infused with essential oils, and rubbing the body when bathed in warm water and other similar remedies, and using heated ointments.
But if the wound is large, then stitches should be administered or the lips of the wound brought together, and then cure it with powders until it heals.[translation notes] "sutura" comes from latin sutura which means a sewing. In medical context it refers to surgical stitching or suture.
But if the wound is deep or if pus has formed in its lower part, then lance it in the most sunken place.[translation notes] "perfora" comes from latin "perfodio" which means "to dig through". In medical context it refers to making a hole or opening through a structure.
But if an artery has been cut in the wound and there is bleeding, then either separate it, or tie it off, or cauterize it if necessary.[translation notes] "inscisa" comes from latin "incisus" which means 'cut'. Here it refers to a cut artery.
But if the vertebrae of the spine have been cut and saved the veins of the neck, then suture the edges of the dura mater (the outermost membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord) over the edge of the wound in the spine and do not touch it; gently pull it together and return it to its natural shape, and then strengthen it with proper support and leave it alone for several days; and cure it with ointments that contain styptic (astringent) properties until it heals.
But if the wound has damaged the bone, then percuss it (strike it gently with a medical instrument to test its condition), and if there are any bone fragments in it, remove all that you can; and what you cannot use, leave it inside until the wound dries up, becomes separated, and the swelling is relieved.
And if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle powder made from the recommended substance over it. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then cure it with what is recommended for this condition, as described in its own chapter.
If it is a wound caused by a lance or sword, and sometimes its depth is visible, then consider if the patient experiences shortness of breath from the wound; if so, know that the wound is fatal.
But if it is not deep and the wound is fresh with its own blood, then in the first hour you should sprinkle powder on it, but do not press hard to prevent the blood from being retained in the depth of the wound and returning to the heart, which could harm the patient. Instead, apply an attractive ointment, and unbind it (the dressing) twice a day.
But if the ointment is not available, then you should apply a clean cloth to the wound to absorb any moisture and make sure the patient lies on the wound so that any pus in it can drain out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound and there are no symptoms of spasm, trembling in the heart, or tightness in the chest, and other good signs are present, then you should know that the wound is healing; and from now on care for it with warm compresses and other treatments until it is healed.
But if healing is delayed and the wound remains open for a long time, then know that a fistula has formed; treat it according to its chapter (or section) in this textbook.
If the wound is caused by a stab or cut from a sword or spear and is simple on the surface of the skin, then treat it with sutures if it is large, or with powder if it is small.
But if the wound has damaged the bone and there are pieces of bone sticking out, then you should twist the wound to remove those bone fragments if they are loose. But if they are not loose, then leave them inside so that the wound can heal and the removal of these fragments becomes easier.
And for other wounds in other parts of the body, the aid in treatment is the same as what has been said (before).
Regarding wounds to the abdomen (ventre), here are some guidelines:
The disorder that occurs in the abdomen can be either severe, mild, or moderate.
A small disruption is made difficult to correct in any other way, and I know that reducing them (the stones) is even more difficult, if you do not take care of the insertion of the stone back into its place immediately, because it becomes swollen and enlarged, making the insertion difficult.
And so, the best disruption is a minor one, because in this case, reducing the intestine is not difficult, as it is in the two types mentioned before.
And know that there are four ways to suture the abdomen, but two of them are more common and suitable for suturing other wounds in the body.
And two other types of sutures are specific to abdominal wounds, but they are also used in other wounds, although they are more specific to the suture of the abdomen.
I recommend to you an explanation and description (of the four types of sutures).
I say that when the wound is small and has come out for some reason due to the intestine, and it is difficult to reduce it, then it is one of two ways: either because of the small size of the disruption, as we have said, or when the intestine has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And so, when it is like this, it is necessary that you scrape it, submerging a sponge or a cloth wet in warm water only, or that you take it in stale water, chamomile, and dill, and introduce it with that to the intestine until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes it is done with styptic, and it is better than water alone in the resolution of inflammation.
And so, when you see the inflammation has been resolved, then you moisten the intestine with water in which elder and mallow have been boiled, because this eases the insertion of it with little difficulty.
But if the insertion of it is excused, then you should cut the wound slightly with an instrument with which incised hemorrhoids are treated.
And the primary cure is better when it is proper and not a section, and does not involve drying out necessary evacuation and shortcoming.
About the instrument, see its form:
One part of it should be curved and sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the tip thin, but not as thin as a spatula, rather it should be slightly blunt.
And so, when the wound is large and the intestine has come out, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form, in its proper place, if possible, because this is better.
But when the disruption is wide and in the lower part of the abdomen, then it is necessary that the patient lies on their side, and you place their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then you should place their head and chest higher than their hips.
And similarly, if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then always direct your attention and consideration towards that side so that the part where the wound is may be higher than the other.
And this should be done in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
And in small wounds, do what you are prepared to do and ensure that the person administering it is between your most trusted servants, who hold the wound with their hand and adjust its lips, and ensure that the suture is done for some reason or another.
And this is the common method of suture: one in which you take a needle or a threaded needle according to the quantity of the width of the wound; and then place it at the edge of the disruption of your ring finger, pull the needle once without inserting suture into both ends of the cord, with two ends of the silk that is after the cord of the inner parts, until you make it penetrate that part; and you have already connected two ends of the thread and two ends of the silk, and this has been done in four rows.
And then pull tightly with double thread in the circuit of the needle, and sometimes from both sides together, and also bring together the lips and wound with appropriate connection; and leave the width of your finger and insert another needle in that place, and tie it with thread as you did with the first needle; and do not stop doing this with the needles until you have completed stitching the entire length of the wound.
And let the needles be of medium thickness between coarseness and delicacy, because fine needles slightly cut the flesh, and thick ones are difficult to insert in the cord, and therefore they should be of medium thickness in terms of delicacy and coarseness.
And it is not necessary for the needle to be inserted too close to both ends of the cord because this may cause slight cutting of the flesh and make the wound open before its healing.
And let the sutures not be too long so that the wound is not prevented from healing.
And then insert the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the patient while they sleep; and place over the suture expanded powders from all sides, which hold the ends of the needles; and leave them in until you are certain that the wound has healed.
And this type of suture with needles is more suitable for small wounds, because even in the suture of them one needle or two or around that number can be used.
And the second common suture is that you administer with a suture the four ends of the cord and two ends of the silk in one go, with a needle on which fine thread is wrapped in delicacy and coarseness.
And then when you have penetrated these four ends with the needle, reduce the needle from that inner part from which you started, so that the thread pulls back towards the higher side of the wound, making the suture like a suture of cloth by which clothes are held together.
And leave between each suture the width of your little finger.
And this suture is suitable for men.
And with this type of suture, I sewed the wound that was inflicted on a man in his abdomen, who had been stabbed with a knife, and the size of the wound was larger than a palm, and the intestines had come out about two palms from the middle part of the intestine, and the disruption was in the middle of the member; and then I reduced it after the intestines had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
And the wound healed within fifteen days or thereabouts, and I cured him and he recovered; and then he lived for many years, and was able to carry out his daily activities.
And other doctors had judged that he would not recover; and it was a miracle, because I did not cure him with ointment, because it was in a place where ointment was not found or any medicine, but I placed an old piece of cloth on the wound twice a day and washed it continuously with honey water until it was healed.
But I describe two types of specific sutures according to the account in the Bible.
And one type is that you start with a suture of the cord and insert the needle from the outer side to the inner side.
And so, when the needle penetrates the cord and that inner layer according to straightness and length of the entire body, leaving the end of the silk on which you have inserted the needle; then insert the needle in the other end from the inner side to the outer side in the other membrane.
And when you have done this once, then insert the needle again in that same end of the membrane from the outer side to the inner side; leave the end of the silk on this side and insert the needle in the other end of the inner side from the inner side to the outer side.
And insert it with that needle in the same way as you inserted it in the silk, making sure that everything penetrates inside.[improved]
And then start from this same side and sew the other end of the silk in the opposite side, remove the needle from the cord that you inserted, and then return it to the cord, sewing the end of the silk on the opposite side with the end of the silk; and then remove the needle from the cord that was inserted.
And do this once and then again, repeating the process until you have sewn everything that is outside according to this example.
And the essence of this method of suturing is that you sew with a suture of pellicles, like you would sew fur, in such a way that you sew the silk once from the side of the end of the cord, leaving the other side open until you have completed it. [improved]
But the second type of specific suture that I mentioned, called "Gualian", is performed as follows: sew it with semi-thickness so that the medicines can be applied, in such a way that all parts are connected to their corresponding parts according to nature; and apply one end of it to the other end of it, and this is done as I have recommended to you. [improved]
It is necessary to insert the needle in the end of the silk outside, and make it penetrate inside the inner side of that same part, leaving two ends of the silk; then turn the needle around and make it penetrate from the outer side to the inner side in those two ends of the silk. [improved]
Then turn those around and make each of them penetrate from the inner side to the outer side in two ends of the silk that are on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the common light one and is the suture that was mentioned before. [improved]
This is the method of Gualian.
And they said that the abdominal suture is corrected with two needles, which means that you insert into each of them a thread and start with the insertion of the needle from your side, making it penetrate to the other side according to the suture of those who sew leather with thread. [improved]
And know that when the disruption is in the middle part of the abdomen, then the suture of it is more difficult than other parts of the abdomen. [improved]
The medication for a wound is also a judgment for other wounds.
This is because when you obtain the wound with its pus before the air alters it, and return the intestines and parts of the body to their proper place and dress the wound appropriately, then apply a powder that promotes healing.
And if the air has already affected the wound, then apply ointments that dry and harden it, causing it to form a scab, heal and be taken care of as with other wounds until it is healed.[ (Note: This seems to be saying to apply drying agents, such as ointment, to the wound if it has already become infected or inflamed.)]
But if you do not have the medicines present, then cover the wound immediately, since it begins to discharge pus and change its color twice a day, as has been taught to you, until it is healed, because you will not need other medicine in most cases when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound may spread and cause injury to the main members (limbs), then it is advisable to soak a lamb's wool in a high-quality bath oil or rose oil, and place it on the affected area between the groin and just above the heels.
And if there is pain or putrefaction in the intestines, which often occurs, then use a black stiptic (a type of wound-healing salve) made with vinegar, and especially if the powder has penetrated into the intestine and caused a perforation in its cavity.
And know that a wound in the large intestine is more easily healed with less pus than one in the smaller intestines.
And it is difficult to heal because the intestine called "gallbladder" does not receive healing from wounds that penetrate it completely; and this is due to the large number of veins in it, and its large size, and due to the subtlety of its body, and its proximity to the nature of nerves.
But if what comes out of the wound is fabric, and you obtain it recently, then return it to its place according to your best judgment, as you would with intestines.
But if it has already passed through a space and turned green or black, then you should strengthen it with bile on the spot that is discolored by it, so that blood flows from it, because there are veins and arteries in the fabric.
And then incise what is other than the membrane, and place two ends of the bile on the part below the wound, so that it is relieved from the attraction of the fabric and the emission of blood from the wound.

And once you have examined all of those possible causes thoroughly, then proceed to the treatment according to your best judgment: that is, consider whether the fistula is nearby and superficial, or further away from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or any of the other locations that you are familiar with and can name.
Then you dry up the fistula as described in the narrative, and remove any matter that is present in the drainage and from rotten flesh, and anything that has emerged from the opening of the skin or from pus and similar substances, and cure it from within so that it heals.
But if the fistula is of great depth and is as it should be, then it is necessary to incise it to the extent that is possible for you, and clean it of all its rotten flesh; and then apply heated cauteries wrapped in sharp medicines and insert those into the cavity of the fistula, which you have surrounded with iron.
And do this several times until the sharp medicine consumes all that is rotten in the cavity of the fistula from corruption.
Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it heals.
But if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have recommended.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain of this, then you should inquire about it and dry it up as we have recommended, unless there is some other cause that prohibits it, such as a vein or nerve or a major member, as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then you should cut into the area where the corruption is housed; and then heal it with that which generates flesh until it heals.
And if it is not healed and it discharges pus as before, then you should know that you have not yet reached the complete eradication of the corruption; and so you should uncover it further and carefully examine it, and clean it thoroughly with a mild substance, and then restore it.
And so if it is healed, that is good; but if not, then you should know that the corruption is in the deep recesses of the body and has not been reached, and so there is nothing to be done but to leave it alone.
And if the corrupt bone is small or can be extracted, then you should extract it with fine forceps that are suitable for this purpose.
And if there are multiple bones, then you should carefully extract all of them, and leave none behind with your strength.
But if any of the humors present opposes this and there is no fear or doubt in incising them, then you should cut into the ligaments or flesh that are here and release the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at this time, then place a poultice on the wound that will help the wound heal, and leave it in place until such time as the area around the bones is clean; and be sure to keep the wound open so that it does not become closed off, and maintain the dryness of the incision that you made during your procedure.
And if you are afraid, place a compress soaked in three times the amount of oil, or a compress soaked in Egyptian ointment, or any other green ointments, because when the ligaments dry out and the bones separate from them, the attraction to draw them back together is relieved.
But if it is a large bone, such as the thighbone or hipbone, and only the surface of it is corrupt, then you should cut into it only to remove the blackness and corruption, and then heal the wound.
But if a large portion of it is corrupt and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close it up and not incise any further into the location where the corruption has spread; and you should heal it from within until it becomes solid again.
And I recommend that you place a cushion under the patient's thigh to provide support and assistance during your procedure.
There was a young man of about thirty years old who experienced pain in his groin, and the matter inside was located deep within the body, having reached the groin from inside; it was pus-filled matter with a large abscess, and it was not caused by any external factor.
And so the abscess went untreated for some time due to the error of the doctors, until it burst and discharged a large amount of matter; its treatment was delayed until the thigh became fistulized, and many openings formed from which pus and the bodily fluids flowed.
And many doctors treated him for two years, but none were able to help him except for me, when I was called upon.
And I saw that his thigh was swollen and the matter that flowed from the openings was copious; and the man's entire body was weakened and his complexion was yellow. [Combining several lines into one sentence for better readability.]
And so I inserted my finger into one of the openings and reached the bone with it.
And then I quickly examined all of the openings and found that they all led to different parts of the thigh. [Combining several lines into one sentence for better readability.]
And so I considered my options and incised into one of the openings until I exposed a portion of the bone, and found it to be corrupt, having turned to earth and become rotten and discolored; and a portion of the thigh had also become corrupt where it had penetrated into the marrow.
And then I removed what was exposed and prepared the bone that I had exposed. [Combining several lines into one sentence for better readability.]
And I decided that the corruption had to be removed from the bone, and so I cut it away and removed it, for I had already exposed it. [Combining several lines into one sentence for better readability.][
And then I applied a consolidating medicine to the wound for a long time, but it did not heal.
And then I re-examined and reopened the wound, exposing the bone again, and found continuous corruption in the bone. [Combining several lines into one sentence for better readability.]
And I removed the corrupt material and attempted to heal and restore the wound, but it was not restored. [Combining several lines into one sentence for better readability.][
And then I examined the wound again and did not stop incising the bone little by little, carefully, until I performed the restoration of it; but it was not restored until I had cut about a palm's width of it, extracting the marrow along with it. Then I restored it with medicines, and it healed slightly and became solid. [Combining several lines into one sentence for better readability.]
And it was not necessary to repeat the procedure or dryness of the wound, but only due to the weakness of the patient and his fear of death, for he was susceptible to fainting due to excessive evacuation. [Combining several lines into one sentence for better readability.]
And so the wound healed completely, and there was no longer any hardened flesh in the bone; the proper alignment of the limb was achieved and its vitality was restored; the patient regained his normal movements and did not experience any harm or injury in any way. [Combining several lines into one sentence for better readability.]
But if the bone is protruding in a traumatized area of the body, then it is necessary to dry it out in this manner: take a strong ligament and tie it at the end of the protruding bone, and have someone pull on it; place a thicker bandage of wool over the first one; then attach it to the skin next to the bone, and extend the limb so that the skin is pulled towards the area below; then uncover the skin in the location where you want to make the incision, so that the saw does not cut into the skin.
And place a board or table beneath the affected bone, so that when you do this, there is no objection to cutting away the rotten flesh.
It is necessary that the sawdust be placed on the rotten area gradually, because if the corruption is in the concavity of the bone and not visible to the touch, it may be necessary to saw further down.
If the bone is rotten and not protruding, separate one part from the other, and if the corruption is in the middle or in a part of it, then you should remove the flesh from all parts completely; and place a board beneath, and saw through the first part where the corruption is until the sawing of the other part is continuous.
And the sawdust should be according to the location of the corruption, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, cut into the affected joint and saw through the bone that is connected to the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuity of two joints, then it is not reasonable to saw, but rather to contrive a solution.
If the corruption is in the flesh of the hand or foot, it is difficult; but it is necessary to examine the corruption and remove it in the way that appears to you, and clean it according to what is possible for you, and with each solution being rectified as long as it does not cause obstruction to the veins or nerves.
And know that the scalpels and saws for cutting these bones are very specific depending on the position of the bones, as well as their preparation, thickness, fineness, size, smallness, hardness, and rarity; therefore, it is necessary to prepare instruments suitable for every kind of operation.
And know that this operation indicates the type of instrument you need; because when you have great skill and knowledge in the methods of this art, as well as experience with various illnesses, then you already have within you what is appropriate for selecting the instruments for every illness.
And now I will list for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments that you will need, which should include simple ones with which you can perform your practice on yourself, and gain experience just as others have done before you. Form of a saw:
Shape of another saw:
Shape of another large saw:
Shape of a beam: Let the head of this beam be in the shape of a starred nail head, and its points be similar to the form of prickly thorns.
And it is not appropriate to do so unless the heads of the joints are rubbed with them when they are corrupted or if the mouth is very wide open.
Shape of a smaller razor:
Shape of a wide razor:
Shape of another well-made saw: it should be made in the shape of an arch above, with a sharp edge of iron, and its handle should be well-made like that of a good knife. Shape of it:
Shape of a razor with a concavity:
Shape of another subtle razor:
Shape of another curved-end razor:
Shape of a small razor resembling a tooth:
Shape of another smaller incising tool:
Shape of another incising tool; this one resembles a beam with the tip shaped like a saw and is used in various places for cutting bone:
Shape of a beam that is appropriate for cutting through bone:
And the tip of it is triangular with a sharp point.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly, it is appropriate for all the causes we have mentioned for razors, incising tools, and saws.
Of incising tips and the sawing of bones.
The tips can become damaged or weakened either due to intrinsic or extrinsic causes, or as a result of an unsuccessful treatment for the corruption caused by certain medicines. In cases where the corruption persists despite medical intervention, it may be necessary to cut into the affected member in order to release the buildup of corruption and prevent further damage or loss of function in the limb.
And the sign that this has happened to you is if the member turns black while it is being cauterized, indicating that the flesh has already been burned, or if the blackness spreads within the member as it becomes gangrenous and begins to affect other parts of the body; in this case, proceed with caution and cut only what needs to be removed.
And similarly, if the corruption is caused by a venomous attack from sources such as sea scorpions, snakes, or spiders, then you must proceed with caution and treat the wound accordingly based on its severity.
And if the corruption or injury is located at the tip of a finger, then you should cut into the finger to prevent the spread of infection and prevent it from entering the hand.
And similarly if you make an incision in the hand, then do so with the tip of a hot cautery and do not leave space for corruption to enter into the wound of the arm.
But if you err, then make an incision in the arm at the joint (i.e. elbow).
And if corruption passes further and you see it around the joint, then in that case the patient will die; and to administer another remedy for this in cure is a matter of great skill/ability.[note] The word "quantitat" can mean both "amount" and "skill/ability", I chose the latter meaning as it makes more sense in this context.
And similarly do with the foot when corruption reaches the toe, then make an incision in it (i.e. the toe) at one of its nails.
And if it takes hold on the sole of the foot, then make an incision across the entire foot. But if it rises up to the ankle, then make an incision in the leg at the ankle joint.
And if corruption has already reached above the ankle, then there is no help for it but to let it be and leave the patient to die.
And the way to make an incision in the limb or to bind it is as follows: you stretch the ligament below the part that you want to incise more than the rest, and stretch another ligament over the spot; then have a servant extend one ligament below the area, and have another servant extend the other ligament above it; and you separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments to a width of at least a fingerbreadth so that all the flesh is exposed; and then make the incision or binding there.[note] Here "liament" can mean either a band, a ligature, or a tendon. I chose "ligament" as it makes more sense in this context, but it could also be translated as "band" or "ligature".
And it is necessary that a cloth be placed around it from all sides so that it does not touch the area, and that a wound dressing be applied to the patient that is fitting and appropriate for an abscess.
But if blood flows while you are operating, then cauterize the area lightly, or place some powder that restrains blood on it; and then return to your medicine until it is completed.
And then bind the affected limb with an appropriate ligament, and cure it until it is healed.
I recommend to you what happens to a man in his foot, the same accident that happened to me, which is that he gets a black spot on his foot due to burning caused by fire (i.e. a burn). [Note] The word "adustio" can mean both "burning" and "scorching", I chose "burning" as it makes more sense in this context.
And the corruption first occurred in his toe, tending to spread across the entire foot.
And then that man prepared for himself the same remedy that I recommended to you, going to the affected limb with great haste due to the severity of the pain and burning sensation, and he made an incision in his foot at the joint (i.e. ankle), and it was healed. [Note] Here "foc" can mean both "fire" and "healed", I chose "healed" as it makes more sense in this context.
For a long time that same corruption occurred in the toe of his indicated hand. [Note] Here "ma indic" can mean either "his index finger" or "his left hand", I chose to translate it as "his index finger" because it makes more sense in this context, but it could also be translated as "his left hand".
And then he came to me, and I managed to redirect that superfluity with what I applied on his hand of medicines, in order to purify the body from it; but the superfluity was not redirected and began to spread to the other toe, starting from the hand. [Note] Here "superfluitat" can mean both "superfluity" and "excess", I chose "superfluity" as it makes more sense in this context. The word "repercutir" can mean both "redirect" and "reflected", I chose "redirected" as it makes more sense in this context. The phrase "mundificacio del cos" can mean both "purification of the body" and "cleaning of the body", I chose "purify the body" as it makes more sense in this context. [Note 2] Here "autra" means "other", but it is not clear if it refers to another toe on the same foot, or a toe on the other foot. I chose to translate it as "other toe" because it makes more sense in this context, but it could also be translated as "another toe".
And he asked me to make an incision in his hand, but I did not want to do so, hoping for the redirection of that superfluity, and fearing more than anything the incision of his hand due to the severity of his illness (i.e. the patient was very weak).
And because he became desperate with me, he returned to his country and I heard that the man made an incision in his entire hand, and it was healed. [Note] Here "inscidic" can mean both "incised" and "operated on", I chose "made an incision" as it makes more sense in this context. The phrase "la sua ma tota" can mean both "his entire hand" and "his whole hand", I chose "his entire hand" as it makes more sense in this context. [Note 2] Here "es sanat" can mean both "it was healed" and "he was healed", I chose "it was healed" as it makes more sense in this context, but it could also be translated as "he was healed".
And I have not prolonged this narrative except to be of help regarding this illness, and as a sign by which it may be understood, and according to which it may be treated. [Note] Here "catz" can mean both "case" and "instance", I chose "case" as it makes more sense in this context. The word "significacio" can mean both "signification" and "meaning", I chose "signification" as it makes more sense in this context. The phrase "segon la qual sia obrat" can mean both "and according to which it may be operated on" and "and according to which it may be treated", I chose "and according to which it may be treated" as it makes more sense in this context, but it could also be translated as "and according to which it may be operated on".[note] This text is a translation of a medieval medical treatise written in Latin. The source of the original text is not mentioned here, but it can be found in other sources that attribute it to the Salernitan School of Medicine, an influential medical school in southern Italy during the Middle Ages. The Salernitan School was known for its synthesis of Greek and Arabic medical knowledge, and this treatise reflects that tradition with its use of Latin and Arabic terms.
On the care of sinuses and the quality of using enemas with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in fleshy parts of the body and its space is extended so that it collects pus, and then it is ruptured and perforated, and the pus is excreted from it, leaving the area hollow as if it were empty, and the skin above it remains thin like a veil, and corruption has not yet reached behind it, nor does it affect bones or nerves or ligaments, it is called a sinus, and it is not named a fistula.
However, if the space is extended in such a way that corruption reaches any member (i.e., body part), then it is called a fistula and not a sinus. The term "zukem" in this context may refer to a type of ulcer or wound that does not penetrate deeply into the tissues, as opposed to a fistula which involves a more extensive communication between two body parts.
And the treatment for it is to incise the entire skin as it is rolled up, and more so when it has become thin like a veil and has been made into a sheet, and ensure that it does not adhere to the area due to its corruption.
But if you hope that the membrane will adhere and that the corruption has not yet reached a point of no return, and there is pus in the membrane, then you should treat it with an enema.
And this is for the sinus, and so if it is large, and there is a bad odor in the arm (i.e., limb), then give an enema with Egyptian medicine which is made of oil, wine, and myrrh, received in equal parts, and mixed together in a vessel, and heated over the fire until the medicine becomes hot and acquires the consistency of honey.
And then you take from it (i.e., the Egyptian medicine) what is necessary and dissolve it in water and honey; and give an enema with this to the sinus, and strengthen its opening, and leave the medicine in for a period of two hours.
And apply a compress to that area; and do so for several days until the cavity is purified and the discharge ceases.
And sometimes the patient is given an enema of ashes and water, when you are not present with this medicine; and you should take the ash of wheat and put it in water; and then use that to give the patient an enema until you are certain that the cavity has been cleared.
And if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine nor the ash and water enema, then give them an enema of water and honey with cinnamon mixed in, and also give them an enema of wine and honey mixed together. This is because honey has the property to purify and cleanse, while wine causes the area to contract. This is especially beneficial when there is excess dryness and stiffness present.[note] I am not a doctor, and this translation should not be taken as medical advice. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for any medical concerns. Additionally, some of the medical practices described in the text may be outdated or even harmful, so it's important to approach this information with caution.[/note] E si le malaute no ha tollerancia sobre le medicament egipciac ni l’aygua de la cendre, lahoras clisteriza aquel am aygua e mel e quays sia mesclat ziniar trissat, e clisteriza aquel am vi e mel mesclat, quar de proprietat de mel es que mondifique e lave, e le vi fa adherir le sinu, e majorment quan en le vi ha superfluitat de stipticitat e de siccitat.
And when you have done this for several days and are confident that the cavity has been cleared, then give the patient an enema with a substance that causes the flesh to be expelled from the area.
And you should take some refined lard and mix it with rose oil and astringent wine, or give the patient an enema with certain medicines and ointments that have the properties described in the treatise on the use of enemas.
And if the opening of the cavity is narrow and the enema nozzle cannot be inserted, then gradually widen it using a small iron tool, and place a piece of cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment inside until it has been sufficiently widened.
And similarly, if the opening is large, then use stitches to narrow it and leave enough space for the enema nozzle to be inserted without difficulty.
And if the opening is located high up on the arm and the veins are swollen, then place a cloth soaked in basilicon ointment on the area to reduce the swelling and allow the vein to be accessed more easily. This is because when the vein is compressed by the swollen cavity, tissue can become damaged in the area.
And if you are unable to reduce the swelling of the cavity as much as you would like, then you must prepare the limb by using a method that allows the vein to be accessed easily and without causing any obstruction. This will enable the vein to be punctured with minimal difficulty and prevent any complications from occurring during the procedure.
And leave the fabric covering the opening of the cavity in place at all times, ensuring that it remains over the area where the vein is accessed. This will help prevent any discomfort or injury to the patient's arm during the procedure. And so that you can determine whether the blood flowing from the vein is abundant or sparse, and whether it is thin or thick.
And as you observe the appearance of the blood, also take into account the location of the cavity and whether the patient experiences pain or swelling in that area. This information can help you determine the most appropriate treatment for the condition.
And as your treatment is continued in this manner, and you notice that the material applied to the opening of the cavity has adhered or begun to stick, then carefully remove it after three days and change the dressing. This will help prevent any infection from developing in the area and allow for proper healing.
However, if you notice that the cavity is large and has produced a significant amount of pus, then do not be concerned if the material applied to the area becomes adhered or stuck, as this can aid in the healing process. This is especially true for individuals who experience slow tissue regeneration or those who are prone to infection. In these cases, it may be beneficial to leave the dressing in place for longer than three days.
And if the cavity continues to produce thick, undigested blood for several days, then you will know that it has not healed properly. In such cases, you should adjust the treatment by using dry medicines rather than those that are moist or wet in nature. This may include ointments like Egyptian lard, which can help reduce excess moisture and promote healing. However, if the cavity is slow to heal due to an overabundance of added material, then it may be necessary to use a different approach entirely.
And the final remedy for healing is to take refined lard and mix it with rose oil, then add a small amount of antimony in its substance, and blend it together until smooth. Apply this mixture to the cavity, covering it completely, and use it as needed.
And similarly, when there is no vein to be accessed, use refined lard or honey that has been heated until it thickens, and apply it to the cavity as needed. Alternatively, you can take myrrh and aloe, grind them into a powder and mix them with melted wax over low heat. Once cooled, spread this mixture over a piece of fabric and place it over the cavity. Repeat this process with honey that has been heated until thickened, then cooled and ground into a powder before being applied to the fabric and placed over the cavity.
And sometimes it is appropriate to administer these remedies using an long, thin instrument called an aristology, along with crushed lily of the valley, powdered barley and centaury. These simple herbs can be ground into a fine powder, mixed with honey, and applied directly to the affected area. Alternatively, you may adjust the dosage as needed based on the individual's symptoms and overall health.
And if the cavity does not heal despite these treatments, it may indicate that the corruption has spread to the bone or surrounding tissues and joints. In such cases, you should use a different approach, such as surgical drainage, as described earlier in this text.
Chapter on the treatment of paronychia (inflammation around the nail), ingrown nails, digital abscess and finger amputation.
Panaricia is an abscess that forms below the nail of a finger or toe, and it can also occur in other fingers. When prolonged and its treatment is delayed, it may become an abscess within an abscess (caut) or corrupt, causing the breakdown of the matrix of the nail and leading to the discharge of pus into the surrounding tissues. This can cause a foul-smelling odor and lead to damage to the bone, resulting in gangrene of the affected digit and its eventual amputation. The color of the affected area may also become dark and bruised-looking.
Therefore, when you encounter such a condition as we have described in the division, and your treatment is not successful, it is appropriate to surgically remove any excess nail tissue with iron tools and then cauterize the wound with a hot instrument, as this can aid in healing. Cautery is often beneficial in such cases.
However, if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, but the growths of the nail are already compressing the surrounding tissue and causing it to become inflamed and painful, then you should carefully make an incision just below the angle of the nail, cutting into the tissue with ease. Apply corrosive medicines to the remaining flesh until it has healed completely, and use ointments to promote healing in the meantime.
However, if the corruption has already spread to the bone, then it is necessary to surgically remove the affected bone tissue and extract it, as there can be no healing while the bone remains corrupt.
And if you see that the corrosion and corruption has spread to the finger, then you should make an incision in one of the knuckles, according to where the inflammation is most pronounced, and then cure it until it heals completely.
But if the nail becomes percussed or injured and causes intense pain, then it is necessary to first bleed the patient by making small incisions on their body to release some blood. Then, carefully dry the nail using a sharp spatula with a transverse cut from top to bottom, taking care not to cut into the flesh beneath the nail, as this could cause further pain and lead to the formation of excess tissue. Finally, cure the affected area with appropriate remedies until the pain subsides.
However, if the condition is congenital and occurs in certain individuals, it may affect the muscles, bones or nails of the affected limb.
And some are born in the ligament of the joint, while others are congenital in certain knuckles of the fingers or toes. However, those born in the knuckles of the finger are not problematic, while those born in the joints are more likely to be troublesome.
And for those that are fleshy by birth, the incision should be easy, and you should make it along its edge using a wide-bladed spatula.
However, for those born in the ligament of the joint, the treatment is more difficult and one should be cautious with surgical intervention to avoid complications.
But for those born in the knuckles of the finger or toe, it is necessary to make a round incision at the beginning of the flesh, cutting into the bone with a suitable saw, and then cure it until it heals completely.
And when there is a consolidation or thickening of the flesh in the fingers due to repeated injury, congenital deformity, infection, burns, or similar causes, then it is necessary to cut into this consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape and form.
And then place between them pieces of linen soaked in rose oil to prevent further thickening and separate the fingers, or insert a thin sheet of lead until it heals as needed.
Similarly, if there is thickening of the flesh in certain fingers along with the palm, you should cut into this thickening according to the preparation and shape of the limb.
Regarding incisions for varicose veins, they are characterized by their appearance as dilated or twisted veins that can be seen just beneath the surface of the skin. These veins are often found on the legs and can cause discomfort, pain, and even ulcers if left untreated.
Varices are indeed varicose veins, which are large, swollen veins that are filled with an excess of melancholic humor. They can occur in various parts of the body, but they most commonly appear on the legs, particularly in individuals who are constantly on the move or engaged in physical labor.
Then it is necessary that you administer purging of the body of black bile several times with forceful evacuation, and bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
But the treatment of their illness is in two ways: one is that they are incised and the black blood is drawn out, and the other way is that the vein is raised and drained completely.
The incision should be done in the following way: first soak the leg with warm water until the thick blood has been resolved, which is the sediment of the leg, then pull the patient's leg up towards the highest part of the thigh near the groin area using a bandage. Next, make an incision in one, two, or three places on the vein, making sure it is wide enough, and raise the black blood with the lower hand below the incision, moving it upwards until the desired amount of blood has been drained, according to the patient's tolerance.
And then bind it up and order the patient to abstain from consuming foods that produce black bile.
And repeat the treatment with phlebotomy when the veins are full, and make note of this for the patient.
But the elevation of their limbs should be done in this way: if the patient's leg is swollen, place it in a bath and soak it with warm water until the skin reddens and the veins are dilated; or have them engage in vigorous exercise, if taking a bath is not possible, until the affected limb becomes flushed.
And then dry the swelling next to the vein by making an incision in the lower leg or behind the knee, or make a cut at the base of the toes.
And then make an incision in the swelling with forceps and remove the vein completely until you feel it, and pay attention to its appearance as you will see it turn dark colored when you have reached the affected area.
And then, as blood flows out of the swelling, you will see the white part that is the tendon.
And then place a rod under the skin to raise it and separate it from the swelling, and suspend it with a lion-shaped clamp.
And then make another incision next to the first one, about three fingers wide, and continue removing the swelling above the vein until it is exposed.
And then raise the skin and make an incision behind the heel, remove the swelling from that area and lift it up so that it comes out of the second incision, and continue to remove the swelling until it is all drained through the second incision. Finally, remove any remaining swelling above the first incision.
And continue doing this until you have removed the swelling from the highest or deepest incision, until it is all drained, and then suture the skin closed.
And if the patient does not cooperate with elevation and removal, then insert a double-threaded needle with strong thread and tie it off, removing the swelling through it. Or insert a rod under the skin and rotate your hand around until the swelling has been completely drained. And be careful not to suture the incision too soon, as it will make it difficult to elevate the skin later and may cause damage to the patient.
And once all of the swelling has been removed, then apply a compress soaked in vinegar and rose oil or unscented oil to the wound, and care for it until it heals.
And if the vein is constricted with twisting and knotting that prevents it from being straightened as we have described, then it is necessary to make an incision along the entire length of the twisted part and at all points of constriction, lifting the skin with forceps until it has been completely raised.
And be careful not to suture the incision too soon, as it will make it difficult to elevate the vein later and may cause damage. Use your judgment in this matter.
The method of incising a vein is as follows:
The shape of a lion-shaped clamp is not as sharp or pointed as other forceps and has a thick and flexible body, so that it does not damage the vein with its thickness. It should not be too thin, as this may cause injury to the vein due to its delicacy, but rather have some excess width as we have described.
The method of extracting a leg vein is as follows:
This vein is formed in the legs, specifically in cold regions such as Al-Andalus (Spain) and Arabia, as well as in dry and barren lands of India where there is little vegetation or water.
And it is more commonly found in other parts of the body, except for the legs.
The formation of this vein is due to the process of putrefaction that occurs beneath the skin, similar to the way venom from snakes and worms causes decay in the body. It forms between the skin and the flesh due to the presence of these harmful substances.
A sign of the onset of this condition is when there is a sudden and intense inflammation in the leg, followed by a blister or swelling in the affected area. From this blister, you may notice the vein protruding and resembling a small plant root. This is an indication that the vein has become engorged with blood and is no longer able to properly drain. [Quand l'inflammation devient soudaine et intense dans la jambe, suivie d'un gonflement ou d'une vésicule dans la zone touchée, il est possible que le veine commence à sortir de ce gonflement, ressemblant à une petite racine de plante. Cela indique que le veine s'est enflammé et ne peut plus drainer correctement.]
And when the afterbirth appears, you should then wrap around it a lead weight of two ounces, and leave it so that the lead is suspended from the thigh.
And as often as there is any cause that affects the surrounding areas, wrap it in lead and bind it securely. This will help to prevent further irritation or inflammation, promoting healing and reducing pain. [Tant que la cause de l'inflammation ou de l'irritation persiste, il est important de continuer à appliquer une pression avec le plomb pour réduire les symptômes et favoriser la guérison.] And if the condition persists for a long time, you may need to make an incision and wrap the remaining portion of the vein. However, do not cut the root or end of the vein until it has completely emerged, as doing so can cause constriction and force the vein back into the flesh, leading to abscesses, pus formation, and severe ulcers in the area. [Si la condition persiste pendant une longue période, il peut être nécessaire de pratiquer une incision et d'envelopper le reste du vaisseau. Cependant, ne coupez pas l'extrémité ou la racine du vaisseau tant qu'elle n'a pas complètement émergé, car cela peut entraîner une constriction et forcer le vaisseau à se rétracter dans la chair, provoquant des abcès, de la pourriture et des ulcères malins dans la zone.](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89rysip%C3%A8le)
Therefore, it is necessary to treat the condition gently and remove it gradually, until it has been completely removed from the body without leaving any residual cause or damage in the body. [Il est donc important de traiter cette affection avec douceur et de la retirer progressivement, jusqu'à ce qu'elle soit complètement éliminée du corps sans laisser de dommages ou de résidus à l'intérieur.]
This vein is typically found to extend about five palms in length in some people, but I have heard of cases where it has grown up to twenty palms long. [Cette veine est généralement trouvée à une longueur d'environ cinq paumes chez certaines personnes, mais j'ai entendu parler de cas où elle a atteint une longueur de vingt paumes.](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89rysip%C3%A8le)
And if the vein is incised during treatment, then insert a probe into the wound and make a long incision into the flesh, extending it into the body until all of the contents have been evacuated. Administer putrefaction medication to the area for several days, and care for the wound as you would for an abscess or other infection. [Si la veine est coupée pendant le traitement, il est important d'insérer un probe dans la plaie et de faire une incision profonde dans la chair, en l'étendant vers l'intérieur du corps jusqu'à ce que tous les matériaux soient évacués. Des médicaments putréfiants doivent être administrés à la zone pendant plusieurs jours, et la plaie doit être traitée comme une abscesse ou une autre infection.]
This vein sometimes has many branches and is more likely to occur at the joint of the foot or in the foot itself. It can produce multiple openings or orifices from which it emerges. [Cette veine peut parfois avoir de nombreuses branches, en particulier lorsqu'elle apparaît à la jonction du pied ou sur le pied lui-même. Elle peut produire plusieurs ouvertures ou orifices à travers lesquels elle émerge.](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89rysip%C3%A8le)
And treat this condition as previously described, following the methods outlined above.
The treatment of worms generated under the skin is called "bovine disease". This condition is caused by parasitic worms that burrow into the skin, often in warm and humid environments. These worms can cause itching, redness, and swelling in the affected area, as well as fever and other systemic symptoms.
This disease is called "bovine illness" in some regions because it often affects cows and is caused by a worm that is born between the skin and flesh, which then travels throughout the body, moving up and down and causing symptoms as it goes. The worm eventually breaks through the skin and becomes visible, appearing as a small creature wriggling beneath the surface of the skin.
The generation of this ailment is due to the putrefaction of certain bodily fluids, much like how worms, snakes, earthworms, and roundworms are generated in the stomach. [La génération de cette affection est due à la décomposition de certains fluides corporels, tout comme les vers, les serpents, les vers de terre et les ascaris sont générés dans l'estomac.]
This condition is feared because when it moves through the body and rises to the head, it can easily enter the brain and cause damage or destruction, leading to serious consequences in many cases. [Cette affection est redoutée car lorsqu'elle se propage dans le corps et remonte à la tête, elle peut facilement pénétrer dans le cerveau et causer des dommages ou une destruction, entraînant de graves conséquences dans de nombreux cas.](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89rysip%C3%A8le)
Therefore, when treating and removing this condition, it is important to wait until it has fully manifested and become apparent through sensation before attempting to remove it. Once the location and movement of the condition are clear, it can be constricted with a tight bandage or other device, dried out with heat or other drying agents, and then gradually removed using surgical instruments or other means. [Par conséquent, lors du traitement et de l'ablation de cette affection, il est important d'attendre qu'elle se soit pleinement manifestée et qu'elle soit perceptible par le toucher avant d'essayer de la retirer. Une fois que son emplacement et sa progression sont clairs, elle peut être comprimée à l'aide d'un bandage ou d'un autre dispositif serré, asséchée à l'aide de chaleur ou d'autres agents desséchants, puis progressivement retirée à l'aide d'instruments chirurgicaux ou d'autres moyens.](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89rysip%C3%A8le)
And if the disease is in the flesh and you cannot find it, then you apply cautery with fire to the area where you suspect it to be, and the most feared cause is corruption within it, which corrupts the place as we have said.
But if you see the disease has reached the head near the eye, then strengthen the eyebrow with a strong tourniquet and dry it out above it, and extract it; and it is necessary that the patient uses purification of their body with medicines that evacuate putrid bad humors, and be cautious of food generating putrefaction.
Regarding incision for abscess/disease in the navel.
This disease is called "nafir" in our land and is pain which occurs in various parts of the body, and it often moves from one part to another.
And I have already seen what you have recommended to me. I was called to a sick woman in a village and discovered her arm, and saw a small abscess in the vein "funis" of the arm, and after an hour it opened on its own, and I saw the abscess move like a worm crawling towards me, but more gently than a snake would, as if it were made of living silver that flowed from place to place.
And then the pain left that location and settled into the muscle, and there it stayed for an hour.
And then it traveled throughout the body until it reached the other arm.
And then she told me that it was spinning throughout her entire body, as I saw; and it was truly marvelous the way it moved from one part to another, the transformation of it and its speed between limbs. And I had already seen this before in my own heels, in the same manner; but I have also seen many cases where pain moves from one part of the body to another. But I have not seen this in the heels as I did with the woman.
And I do not think it was the same because the woman was old and her body was dry with visible veins, and this is what caused the sensation of abscess moving from one part to another.
And it is necessary that this complication does not appear in those who are delicate and have moist bodies with thin veins.
And when you want to treat it and the patient feels pain, then do not apply the cure to the heel as I have said before, but rather strengthen it by applying pressure lightly and drying it out above it until the constricted pus is released, and then cauterize the spot.
But if you do not see it on your own heels, then treat it with laxatives and methods that expel wind from the body, and cleanse it with foul-smelling pills and serapic pills and similar ones.
Regarding the removal of arrows.
Arrows are of different types based on their material and the locations in which they are used, because their diversity lies in those that have large tips, small ones, concave ones, blunt ones, those with three wings, those with tongues, and those with feathers (fletching).
And the signs of impending death are when an arrow hits and passes through bone, exiting at the base of the skull which is above the brain, causing violent shock, loss of vision (scotomia), dizziness, paralysis of the limbs, inflammation and pain in the tongue, spasms, confusion, vomiting bile, difficulty speaking and a hoarse voice, white fluid or pus oozing from the wound resembling fine particles like dust, and similar signs such as watery discharge from the wound.
And therefore if you observe these signs of impending death, then it is better to refrain from treating or removing the arrow, unless absolutely necessary.
But the signs of an arrow hitting the heart when it is near the left nipple and feels as if it has been embedded in a hard surface, without causing visible damage, are that the movement of the arrow is similar to that of a pulse, there is black blood flowing from the wound, a sensation of coldness in the extremities, chills, and fainting. And so you should know that death is imminent.
And the signs of an arrow hitting the lungs are sputum or blood mixed with froth coming from the wound, swelling of the veins near the throat, a change in the patient's complexion, difficulty breathing, and a desire for cold air.
And if an arrow hits the fascia (the membrane covering the muscle) in the foot, then the pain will be located near the small ribs and cause great discomfort with a strong sensation of pressure and deep breathing, but not all muscles will be affected.
And if an arrow hits the stomach, then food or undigested matter will soon come out of the wound.
And if an arrow hits the abdomen and becomes embedded in it, then there will be a tear or rupture in the peritoneum (the lining of the abdominal cavity), or in the intestines, and there is little hope for recovery if the arrow is removed.
And if an arrow hits the bladder and urine flows out of the wound, and there is some other cause for leakage from outside the body, then there will be pain in the affected area and you should know that it is a fatal injury.
But other limbs such as the face, neck, and throat, shoulders and arms, spine (vertebrae) of the back, collarbone, hip bone, thigh, and similar members are saved when the arrow does not hit a vein or artery, and is not poisonous.
And I will tell you what I have observed about the nature of these arrows so that you understand the treatment better.
The reason for this is that when an arrow hits the lacrimal gland in the inner corner of a person's eye near the nose, I have removed it from the other side, beyond the ear lobe, and the wound has healed without causing any damage to the eye.
And I removed another arrow from a Jew that struck him in the corner of his eye, beyond the eyelid, and the arrow was hidden and could not be seen except for a small portion of its tip attached to the shaft, and it was a large arrow of the sharp arrows used by the Turks, with a lion's head on the end but without any feathers.
And the Jew did not suffer any injury or harm to his eye.
And I removed another arrow from a Christian man that had struck him in the throat, and it was an Arabic arrow with feathers on both ends. So I inserted my fingers between his neck muscles and gently extracted the arrow, and the Christian recovered.
And extracted another arrow from a man who had it fallen in his belly, and thought he would die from it; and therefore, since thirty days had passed and no cause of his condition had changed, I decided to act on the arrow and pull it out, and he was healed, and no adverse event occurred.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow fell in his back, and the wound became gangrenous on him, but after seven days, the arrow came out by itself through his thigh.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow fell in her belly, and the wound became gangrenous inside her, but it did not affect her condition or any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow fell on his face and the wound became gangrenous, but the arrowhead broke off, causing little pain, similar to this case.
And I extracted the arrow from the man of the king's entourage, who had it fallen in the middle of his nose and already tilted slightly to the right side, and the whole arrow was hidden.
And I was called for the treatment of the patient within three days after the arrow was lodged in him.
And when I examined the wound from the arrow, it was very tight; and then I probed gently with my finger, but did not feel anything; yet he felt a pricking under his right ear, and so I suspected that this pricking came from the tip of the arrowhead.
And I applied a plaster with attractive and digestive properties to the area, confident that it would cause an abscess to form and show me where the arrow was, so that I could dry up the wound around it.
And no significant event happened in the area where the arrow had entered, and I continued to apply the plaster for several days without any adverse effects; meanwhile, the wound healed, and the patient felt better over several days until one day he sensed the arrow in his nose and informed me.
And then I applied a sharp and corrosive medicine to the wound for several days until it became open, and by probing with my finger, I found the tip of the arrow, which was still attached to the shaft.
And then I continued to apply the sharp medicine until the wound opened and I could see the tip of the arrow clearly; this process took me around four months.
And when the wound became larger, I attempted to insert forceps into it, but they did not fit; so I continued to devise and come up with ways to remove it until one day, using a certain type of forceps that I had made for this purpose, I managed to extract the arrow from the wound; and then I restored the wound.
And some doctors judged that the cartilage in his nose would not heal, but I healed it and the wound closed, and the patient was cured completely without any problems or complications.
And I report to you the quality of extracting some arrows and give rules and significance for what I have not said, because the parts of this art and the definitions of it are not understood through narration or contained in this book.
And the wise craftsman compares little to much; and what is present to what is absent; and he finds new operations and new instruments for the resolution of foreign causes when they arise.
And so I say that arrows are not easily forgotten in the members where they are lodged, but rather according to two methods: either by attraction of the place where it entered; or by opposition from the other side.
And an arrow that is cast out by the place where it entered is either a piercing arrow that has penetrated a fleshy part and been driven out, or it has fallen into a cavity or crevice in the body, such as the skull or the sinuses of the head.
And if it does not come out at the time it entered, then you must leave it for several days until the flesh around it becomes swollen and the attraction to it is relieved, making its removal easier.
Similarly, if the arrow has entered into bone and does not come out on its own, then you must leave it alone for several days and apply traction and movement to it each day until it is expelled.
And if it does not come out on its own after several days, then you must perforate the bone around the arrow in all directions with a fine drill until the wound is enlarged enough to extract the arrow.
But if the arrow is hidden within the body and cannot be felt, then you should probe for it with your finger or other appropriate instrument until you locate it, and then use suitable tools to extract it.
But if you cannot extract the arrow due to the constriction of the wound and its depth, and it is not in bone or a nerve or vein, then you should incise the wound further until it becomes larger and more accessible for removal.
And if the arrow is stuck in the ears and held there by them, then you must carefully release the flesh around it from all sides using any means available to you; and devise a way to remove it without damaging the ears by breaking or twisting them.
And when you extract the arrow from any location in the body, then use twisting motions with your hand and forceps on all sides to make it easier to remove; and use subtle techniques to avoid breaking the arrow and making its removal more difficult.
And if you cannot extract the arrow at your first attempt, then wait for several days until the surrounding tissues become more relaxed and swelling subsides, and then try again as this will make extraction easier. But if attempting to extract the arrow causes excessive bleeding, then you should follow the procedures for controlling bleeding as described in its corresponding chapter.
And be careful not to injure any veins, nerves or tendons while removing the arrow, and use every means available to you to safely extract it with ease and calmness, taking your time and being deliberate in your actions as recommended.
And therefore, try to extract the arrow in such a way that it follows the same path as when it entered the body, which is more beneficial for the patient. But if this is not possible, then you should use any means available to extract the arrow safely and effectively.
But arrows that have been expelled by the opposite side or that have started to protrude from inside the body or that cause swelling on the outside of the limb where they are lodged should be dried with a cloth and then extracted carefully, using gentle traction as they tend to come out easily in such cases. The incision should be made according to the size of the forceps used for extraction.
But if the arrow is lodged in bone, then twist it in the opposite direction until it moves freely within the bone and the wound becomes larger, making it easier to extract.
Or, leave the arrow alone for several days until it is possible to extract it more easily.
And if part of the arrow shaft remains inside the wound, then you should push it out with your fingers or other suitable instrument.
But if the arrow shaft has fallen out and you wish to apply pressure, then insert a concave instrument into the wound alongside it in order to get a grip on the tip of the arrow and push it out with your fingers or other suitable tool.
But if the arrow is curved, then you should insert a strong instrument into it to straighten it out and make it easier to remove.
And if the arrow is barbed, then you must cut away all of the flesh around it and cure the wound with appropriate treatments.
If the arrow has entered the foot or belly or bladder or ribs and is close enough to be touched with your finger, and if it is possible to dry the wound, then do so and be careful not to injure any veins or nerves. Extract the arrow carefully, taking care of the wound as needed, and cure it until it heals completely.
Here is a description of forceps used for extracting arrows:
The ends of the forceps are shaped like a bird's beak and have serrated edges that grip onto the arrowhead to prevent it from slipping during extraction.
And there are many types of forceps made in different sizes, large, small, medium, according to the size and slenderness of the arrow and the width of the wound, as well as the constriction of the wound.
The form of an impeller for a blunt arrowhead is like a needle, designed to facilitate the insertion into the concave arrow and push it out with that one. This type of impeller is useful when the arrowhead is not sharp enough to penetrate the concavity and needs a sharp point to push it out. The needle-like shape allows for precise application of force and easy maneuverability within the wound.
Here is a description of bloodletting from veins:
The veins commonly used for bloodletting are the following: Of these veins, 16 are located in the head: So there are two pulsating veins that are near the ears, which are called temporal veins; two herbs that are apparent in the temples; and two veins that are in the lacrimal glands of the eyes, which are called aspicientz veins. There is also a vein located in the middle of the forehead, as well as one at the tip of the nose. Additionally, there are two veins in the neck, and two veins each in the upper and lower lips. These latter four veins are called angular veins, and there are two more veins that are located below the tongue. Veins that are punctured in the arms are five. Four of these are cephalic, and one is the latissimus; and people call it "the vein of the head," and it is deep, and it is a small vein, and it is made up of a branch of the basilica, and another branch of the cephalic; and people call this one "the vein of the whole body"; and basilica is the vein that is punctured in the cubital fossa, and it is called "cephalic," and people call this one "vein of the forearm"; and funis of the arm, and it is punctured near the wrist, and it is the one that is punctured, and it appears above the pulse manifestly; and salvatella, and it is the vein that is between the cubital fossa and the little finger, and there are two branches.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins: one of these is located below the curve of the nail of the big toe, which is the latissimus; the second is saphenous, and its location is below the calf of the cubital fossa; and the sciatic vein, and its location is below the calf of the cubital fossa; and there are other similar veins in the calf.
The benefit of veins that are near the ears is for ancient cathartic and migraine treatments, as well as safflower and old ulcers on the head.
And the quality of bleeding those veins is as I recommend to you: cut the patient's head and rub their head in the occipital region where both veins are located with a large cloth with good friction; then strengthen the patient by wrapping a bandage around their neck so that both appear near the ears in two sunken areas of the head, and look for those with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those with your finger, this is a sign to stop.
And then you take the cutting lancet, which is incisive, and then you insert it below the vein in the cubital fossa until the bleeding comes to the bone. And then raise your hand with the vein and cubital fossa to the parts above, and incise the vein with an incisive incision. And let the length of the incision be the quantity of two fingers adjusted or around that, and let blood flow as much as you want.
And then strengthen with poultices and leave it until it heals.
And I have already mentioned at the beginning of this book the incision of these veins and their cauterization.
But the benefit of the two arteries in the temples is that of ancient and stubborn migraines, as well as chronic eye pain and acute gouty effusions in the hands.
And the method of bleeding those veins is as I recommend to you: constrict the patient's neck so that both veins appear by touch through a manifest sensation, and demonstrate their pulse below your finger; and then stop when you feel it.
And then you raise the cubital fossa above the vein to the parts above with your index finger, insert the incisive bleeding lancet below it, and lift the vein; make an incision in it as you have done with the other two veins, and let the blood flow according to the quantity of your need.
And then loosen the patient's bandage, place your finger over the vein for an hour, and then place a compress and poultices over it and strengthen it above with strong compression, and leave it alone until it heals.
And the mention of them, and their incision, has already been made in the beginning of this book.
And therefore, the benefit of bleeding the frontal vein is similar to that of bleeding the cephalic vein for ancient facial illnesses, migraines, coughs, and fetid ulcers.
And the method of bleeding it is as I recommend to you, which is that the patient constricts their neck with a bandage so that the vein appears, and then take the instrument called the fossor, which has this shape:
Place the pointed end of the fossor, which is at its head, over the vein and strike it with a penchant or another cause in the manner of using it, and let the blood flow according to the quantity you want; then loosen the patient's perforation and strengthen it until it heals.
And sometimes it is necessary to bleed with a large lancet, but it is not appropriate for the lancet to have an acute tip like other bleeding lancets; instead, keep it away from sharp edges and bleed it transversely because the bone is close and easily broken when the lancet is thin.
But the benefit of the two veins that are in the lacrimal sacs of the eyes for scabies on the hands, coughs, and boils on the hands, as well as facial illnesses.
And the method of bleeding is that the patient constricts their neck with a bandage, and then you bleed those veins while standing over their head.
And make the incision transverse and short with a small bleeding lancet, because in this location there is not much flesh; and if the lancet is thin, it easily breaks at its edge.
And then let the blood flow according to your needs, place a compress over it, and strengthen it for one night; then remove the bandages.
But bleeding the nasal vein is beneficial for treating acute fever and violent thirst, as well as facial illnesses and migraines that occur on the face, especially if they are ancient.
And the method of bleeding it is that the patient constricts their neck and holds their nose with your left hand, and take a thin long lancet and insert it in the middle of the head of the nose along its length because the vein does not appear by touch here, and blood starts to flow immediately.
It is appropriate that you end your hand with the bleeding slowly and let the blood flow according to your needs; and then bandage it for one night because it heals easily.
But the benefit of bleeding the two guiding veins is for the constriction of ale and the beginning of leprosy, as well as many other illnesses and impetigo and corrosive ulcers like herpetroemia.
And the method of bleeding them is that the patient constricts below each one in their neck with a ligature, and the surgeon stands over the patient's head, and the patient sits on a stool.
And then make a long incision in the vein with a wide, small lancet slowly and let out blood according to the measured quantity or as much as you see is necessary; and proceed similarly with the other vein.
And then loosen the ligature and strengthen both veins with mild compression so that the patient is not weakened, and leave it alone for a while until the wound heals.
And the benefit of bleeding the varicose veins is for small abscesses and pustules in the mouth, as well as gum decay and corrosive ulcers and fissures, and for ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
And the method of bleeding them is that you make the patient sit in front of you, and strengthen their neck with a bandage, and then turn their lips and look at two veins, one on each side of the lip; and the demonstration of which one is which is by the darkness of both, and this is because there are small black veins around them. And then make an incision in each one using an incisive incision.
But if you are unsure which one it is, then you should make an incision in the larger of the two and the more obvious one.
And proceed similarly with the two veins that are on the upper lip.
But the benefit of bleeding the two veins that are below the tongue is similar to that of bleeding the cephalic vein for fainting spells that occur in the throat, as well as illnesses of the uvula and mouth.
And the procedure for bloodletting is as follows: place the patient between your hands in front of the sun, lift their tongue and look beneath it, observe the veins on both sides, and note that the color of each is turning toward black.
Then perform bloodletting on each [vein]; and be careful not to reach an artery while bloodletting, for there are arteries beneath them.
And the veins that are customarily bled in the cold are those that run through the whole body in all men. The bloodletting of these is done in two ways: either by placing myrtle or olive at a subtle degree; or by drying with a scalpel, and it is called thus, and this is its form:
Let the myrtle leaf be as wide as necessary, and it is appropriate to open the hollow veins that appear thick and contain coarse blood.
And this bloodletting has a smaller width and more subtle end, and it is appropriate for bloodletting of delicate veins that contain fine yellowish blood.
But the aid of bloodletting from the basilic vein, which is one of three veins: for extracting blood from illnesses that are located below the waist and neck, and also for drying up the chest and abdomen.
And it is appropriate for the bloodletter, when bloodletting from this one, to be careful and cautious in doing so, because beneath it there is an artery; and if they make a mistake and pierce with the bloodletting needle, they will cut the artery and cause a flow of blood, therefore it is necessary not to perform bloodletting with a pointed needle, but rather cutting with "secare".
And if the basilic vein is not visible through manifest appearance, then you must leave it and move to the other one, or look for a branch of it; or perform bloodletting at the end of the arm, because that one is visible; and dry it with "secare" technique as I have said.
But if you want bloodletting from the median vein, then it is appropriate before the tightening of the arm to touch the area between the pulse location that you know; and place your hand over it with a cloth; and bend the arm and dry the vein with a concave incision using "secare" technique as I have said; and make sure that there is no percussion for some space in the area of the artery.
And when you see that the ligament is tight and there is swelling in the area that you have marked with a cloth, then this swelling is due to the artery; therefore avoid it.
And if you see the blood flowing from bloodletting like a child's urine, and the blood is thin red, then you know that it is arterial blood; therefore stop and hold your finger over that area for a long time; and place a cloth over it, and if the bleeding has stopped, because often it has stopped, then strengthen the arm and leave it.
And take care of the patient from their phlegm, and be cautious of them and do not harm them for several days until they are healed.
But if the bleeding has not stopped, and you do not have medical remedy for it, then cut the artery if it appears to you; because its end is contracted, and the blood has stopped flowing; or take a piece of fig tree bark, make an incision in it, and take one half and strengthen it over the location of the vein with tight ligature and wool within a day.
And if the bleeding has stopped, that is good; but if not, then cure it with what is mentioned before in the memory of the location of the powders for stopping blood flow.
And stopping the bleeding of an artery is difficult in many cases due to the small size of the wound and the possibility of arm ligament constriction.
But bloodletting from the fusca vein is helpful for extracting blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of branches of the basilic and cephalic veins, as I have said.
And it is necessary for the bloodletter to be cautious in performing bloodletting from this one because beneath it there is a nerve; and if they pierce with the bloodletting needle and hit the nerve, then it will cause stupor, and it is difficult to heal, and often it is not healed completely. And this nerve is often felt by sensation; and if it is hidden in some people and is subtle and not visible, then it is necessary for you to stop bloodletting with the one that you perform using "secare" technique, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then perform a longitudinal incision on the vein.
The benefit of bloodletting from the cephalic vein is that it extracts blood from the head and relieves illnesses in the hands.
And it is appropriate in this case, if you want to perform bloodletting with an olive or myrtle bloodletting instrument; because it is the safest of all veins, as there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
But however, a boil is often formed in some people when they are not bled at the first attempt of percussion, but it does not become noticeable immediately.
The first of them is that you must know that bloodletting is not administered except for the preservation of health and hope for it, and with caution against the occurrence of illnesses; and it should be performed on one of the veins that are present in cold conditions, namely: cephalic, fusca, and basilica; and it should be performed at the beginning of spring, during fasting in spring and fall, and in winter close to mealtime when signs of repletion appear.
And it should be performed bloodletting on the third day or at least after three hours have passed from sunrise.
But bloodletting which is administered, except when there is a need or necessity for it, either at night or during the day, at any time and in all seasons.
And it is appropriate that a child should not be bled until they reach the age of fourteen; and a pregnant woman should not be bled from the fourth month up to the seventh month; and old people who have passed the age of sixty should not be bled.
And if someone wants to be bled in any way, it is necessary that they clean their intestines before bloodletting with an enema of lion's milk, if there is a large crack held within them; so that the veins do not push out excess fluid during bloodletting from the intestines which are pure, and do not dirty the main members.
And patients with chronic nausea and dizziness should not be bled; nor should they avoid illness or intoxication until it is resolved in them; and patients with dropsy should not be bled; but bloodletting should be avoided in cases of colic pain, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and excessive coughing and physical exertion or fasting or vigils, and any cause that weakens the strength, whether it is corporeal or animal.
And consider in refinement of humors beforehand if the blood is thick, with food and drinks, and with medicines if it is possible for that.
And enter into the bath if there is no prohibition for any reason, or engage in some exercise so that the blood may be refined.
And stop the bloodletting from that one at the foot of the day, which is around the hour of terce, as we have said.
And ensure that the foot of that one is protected from all animal accidents on that day, such as anxiety, anger, fear; and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, excessive pain, coughing, and similar things.
And at his seat, let there be present the causes in the form of aromatics and odors and balms similar to those that are customary for men, according to the quantity of possibility.
And have the phlebotomist sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the person who is to be phlebotomized.
And have him extend his arm, and let the phlebotomist wipe it with his hand two or three times; then tighten the ligature with a strap and wrap it twice.
And let the tightening be moderate, for if the tightening is too loose or there is excess tightening, it prevents the flow of blood; but if it is too loose, it also prevents the body from expelling blood.
And when the ligature is applied, it is necessary that the person who is to be phlebotomized rub his hands together between them so that the veins become inflated and are perceptible to touch.
And let the phlebotomist anoint his lancet with a little antidote oil properly; and let him place his left index finger over the vein, just above the location where he wants to perform the phlebotomy, so that the vein moves slightly away and the percussion is eased because it is easier to find the veins when they move like strings during phlebotomy, and if they are filled with gas and become contracted when you place the lancet over them, then the phlebotomist should withdraw; and if the lancet opens the vein, it will be narrow.
And therefore, it is necessary that the phlebotomist be steady and attentive to all these causes.
And let the phlebotomist withdraw the lancet, but if the vein is located in a fold of skin, then it is good; and if not, then you should try another fold just below that location a little, or quickly above it if the location is not infected.
And if the location is infected or the patient is fearful, then you should leave it alone for a day or two and not tighten the ligature, because doing so will easily draw an infection to the surface of the skin or prevent the body from expelling blood through sweat in a bath.
And let the phlebotomy be repeated if necessary.
And if the opening is small and the blood flows subtly, and you fear that not enough blood will be released, then you should repeat the phlebotomy in that vein according to the proper amount and adjust the opening slightly larger, but do so quickly before the location becomes infected, because in many men the location easily becomes infected with only a small incision.
But if you see that the location is already infected, then do not repeat the procedure there, for it will not help in any way; instead, place a piece of cotton soaked in oil over part of the incision, because it facilitates the expulsion of blood from the body. And it is better in this location to use oil than other oils.
And similarly, apply a piece of cotton soaked in oil to every phlebotomy where you open veins to prevent the expulsion of blood from the body, and do this with theriaca and sage when it is placed on one side of that incision over the location, because the blood becomes thinner and more fluid when it is thick.
And if a large abscess is formed in the location of the phlebotomy, because many folds of skin are present, especially in those who have not been bled before or only in one vein or at a small incision on the vein, then you should apply heat and place a sponge soaked in warm salt water over the location for an hour, because it will dissolve.
And it is necessary to do this at the onset of blood flow from that vein with adequate pressure or from another vein.
And if there is some blackness or greenness in the location for several days, do not be concerned; and if you wish, place a piece of aloe and myrrh dissolved in it, or a piece of juice from mint or chamomile or something similar to it.
And many folds of skin are present in abscesses and swellings, for which phlebotomy of the basilic vein is necessary.
And therefore place your hand over it, and if you find softness, then increase the pressure on that swelling, because if you do not, the swelling is bad and malignant; and in this case, be careful to apply a piece of cotton soaked in something that we have mentioned, because blood will easily flow from the artery.
And apply a poultice with something that has styptic properties to strengthen the location and care for it with other treatments until it is healed.
And it is necessary to extract blood from every person according to the amount of their vitality and the color that appears on the blood, as appropriate.
Because if the blood is black, then let it flow until it becomes red; and similarly, if you see that it is thick, then let it flow until it becomes thinner; and similarly, if it is fast-flowing, then let it continue to flow until its speed is slowed.
And it is necessary for those who are overweight and have a need for bloodletting in one location that the incision on the vein be widened and the lancet be wide.
And for those who are weak, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to extract blood in many locations with a narrow incision.
And the best method for phlebotomy of veins is a transverse section, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is free from blood flow and nerve injury, and it is more commendable and safer than phlebotomy according to length and width.
And for those who are accustomed to fainting during phlebotomy, it is necessary to care for them before the procedure with a little bread infused in wine of millet or simple oxymel warmed; and extract only a small amount of blood in three or four incisions.
And if the person has a cold complexion, then they should drink something before phlebotomy, such as bread infused in myrrh or honey scented with spices like pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and similar ones, or scented and fragrant hydromel.
And if fainting occurs during phlebotomy due to a large loss of blood, then it is necessary for the person to drink water with meat and fragrant hydromel; and use aromatics with aloe, and wrap their chest with it.
And use the other methods that we have mentioned in the division in the chapter on fainting for evacuation.
And those who want to thin their arms and dissolve their blood gradually should undergo phlebotomy in many locations with moderate evacuation, because their vitality is weak; and they should do this gradually according to the amount of their vitality on consecutive days.
But those who want to thin their arms and expel their blood a second time, and their body is strong, should do this approximately seven or nine hours after the first phlebotomy.
But those who want to draw blood from their body in the opposite direction of where it is flowing should undergo phlebotomy on the second or third day.
But if the body has a large amount of congealed blood that is causing fever, then it is necessary to expel a large amount of blood in one location and widen the incision until fainting occurs, as long as all the conditions of phlebotomy are met; and place your hand over their pulse while they are bleeding, so that death does not occur instead of fainting, because many people experience this when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not necessary when you want to thin the arms and evacuate blood gradually, as the orifices of the vein are already closed and making the flow of blood difficult, that you press hard on it with force and slightly bend and extend the limb, because this is very harmful.
Instead, leave it alone until it can be phlebotomized again; or use the speed of the lancet that is coagulated with blood in the orifices of the vein; or place a piece of theriaca alfarach or sage on it and compress it lightly until the blood has flowed out.
And if the vein is infected, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the infection has subsided.
And if necessity prompts you to bleed someone a second time, and there is no excuse, then proceed to bleed them on that same spot or on the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "lifeline of the arm" is to be phlebotomized in place of the fleshy or basilic veins when they cannot be found or are concealed, as it consists of those.
And the practice of phlebotomy is such that the patient places their hand in warm water until the vein becomes visible and prominent.
Then apply pressure to the surrounding area with a ligature to restrict blood flow; and perform the incision transversely, not longitudinally or laterally.
And make the incision wide, and perform the bloodletting with precision when you open that vein near the joint of the hand a little.
And if blood flow is to be avoided, then immerse your hand in warm water and allow the blood to flow into it until you have achieved your desired result.
However, if you are in the summer season, then it is an exception to refrain from immersing your hand in warm water, and instead, bloodletting is performed by placing the body part in warm water during winter.
And the phlebotomy of this vein is safer than that of all other veins because there are no palpable veins or nerves present nearby.
And the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein in the right arm is beneficial for liver conditions.
And the practice of phlebotomy is such that you apply pressure to the area with a ligature or your hand after immersing it in warm water until the vein becomes swollen and prominent, and then perform the incision transversely; and even if it is deeply embedded, this will not be harmful.
And take care not to cut too deeply with the phlebotomy, as there are nerves located just beneath the surface of the skin.
And immerse the hand in warm water and allow the blood to flow into it, because if you do not immerse it in warm water, the blood will coagulate at the site of the incision, which is to be avoided.
And once the required amount of blood has been drawn, apply a mixture of oil and salt to the vein to prevent it from healing over too quickly, and similarly, this must be done for all incisions made during the procedure.
However, the benefit of phlebotomy in the left arm is that it is beneficial for conditions related to the spleen.
And do similarly in performing phlebotomy as you have done with the other one.
And the benefit of venesection in the saphenous vein is for conditions affecting the lower body, such as menstrual disorders and retention of menses, as well as diseases of the kidneys and old ulcers of the thighs and shins, and similar conditions.
And the practice of venesection in this location is such that the patient places their foot in warm water and massages it until the veins become visible; then a bandage is applied over the ankle joint, and the location of the vein should be identified by its prominent position on the top of the foot, with branches extending up the leg.
And therefore, make a wider incision above or below the ankle joint near the bulge of the vein, as this is safer and more effective.
And if you perform venesection on the leg, then take care not to damage the nerves that are located below the vein, and make your incision transversely as if you were about to cut into it.
And these are the venesections.
However, if the flow of blood is to be avoided, then immerse the patient's foot in warm water and allow the blood to flow into it until the necessary amount has been evacuated.
And if the phlebotomist misses on the first attempt, then try again with the venesection in a slightly different location, as this is safe; and do not be concerned about any harm to the patient, but rather take care to avoid damaging the nerves, as previously advised.
And do similarly with the saphenous vein in the other leg as well.
And the location of the sciatic vein, as previously mentioned, is below the calf in the lower extremity.
And the benefit of venesection in this location is for pain in the hip caused by congestion of blood.
And the technique for venesection in this location is such that the patient enters a bath, and then flexes and tenses the muscle of their leg from the side of the shin up to four fingers' width above the ankle, with a long, fine band placed around it so as not to be visible.
And therefore, when the vein appears, then you should perform venesection according to each individual case that is possible for you and transversely if at all possible, as this is better; or incise it with a scalpel or cut it with a lancet, as the location is safe.
And in many men it is quite narrow; and if you find it and it does not appear to be fully formed, then perform venesection on one of its branches, which appears on the back of the leg opposite the little finger and ring finger.
And take care to avoid damaging nerves, and allow blood to flow in the desired amount.
And then release the ligature and place pressure on the site of venesection to stop the bleeding, as it heals quickly.
Regarding cautery and its uses and techniques.
Cupping is used for corns, hemorrhoids, or boils.
Cupping is performed in two ways: one method involves scarification and the extraction of blood, while the other method does not involve scarification.
Cupping without scarification can also be performed in two ways: one method involves the use of heat or fire, while the other does not.
And to the twelve locations of the body where cupping with scarification and extraction of blood is administered, one such location is the nape of the neck, which is the back of the head; another location is in the middle of the neck between the two shoulders; cupping on the chin below the jawbone, further down from the mouth; cupping with two spatulas; cupping on the bladder, which is at the end of the spine; cupping with two fire-cupping glasses, which are two arms' lengths; cupping on both knee joints; and cupping on both thighs.
And cupping does not extract blood from the veins but rather from the small vessels spread throughout the flesh, and thus it does not exhaust one's strength as does venesection; nor is it necessary for cupping to be performed with fire or without fire in any illness caused by congestion until the whole body has been evacuated.
But if necessity requires cupping for illness or chronic conditions, administer it at the beginning of each month and at the end of it, in the middle of the moon cycle and at any time necessary.
And therefore when any of those causes occur, particularly during the third or middle phase of the moon cycle, then cupping should be performed more than two or three hours after sunrise.
The benefit of cupping on the nape is that when it alleviates heaviness in the head and the congestion in the feet, it is necessary for there to be overall evacuation of the whole body.
And this cupping location is at the site of venesection on the cephalic vein.
And it is not allowed for those with skin eruptions or catarrh to use cupping as it causes great harm.
And therefore its use is not necessary for the elderly, particularly those who have brittle bones or fragile health.
But for those who have continuous sweating near the cupping location, it is necessary that you instruct the cupping practitioner to pause their hand slightly below the cupping glass in order to prevent the generation of forgetfulness.
But cupping on the back is at the site of venesection on the great saphenous vein and the basilic vein: it alleviates asthma, constriction in the chest, and cough, as well as congestion.
And it is necessary for the cupping glass on the back to be applied slightly higher up, because if it is placed too low, it can cause weakness in the body and stomach.
And cupping at the temples alleviates accidental headaches and eye conditions, migraines, fever, and toothaches: it is performed at the site of venesection on the basilic vein.
And it is necessary for you to instruct the cupping practitioner not to press their hand with a scalpel during scarification because this can cause injury to the artery and lead to excessive bleeding.
And cupping below the chin alleviates bad breath in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar illnesses in the mouth: it is performed at the site of venesection on the labial vein which runs along the two lips.
But cupping performed on both cheekbones alleviates congestion due to heat: this is done to relieve symptoms caused by an excess of heat in the body.
And cupping performed on both sides of the hips alleviates symptoms that would be treated by venesection of three veins: the great saphenous, basilic, and cephalic veins. This is because it extracts blood from all the small vessels in the skin that feed into these larger veins, allowing for the evacuation to reach the three main veins.
And instruct the cupping practitioner not to make too many incisions during scarification because this can cause damage to nerves and blood vessels as the skin is already stripped of flesh.
And this cupping method is performed on the hips and can alleviate hemorrhoids in the anus as well as ulcers located further down.
And it is necessary for you to instruct the cupping practitioner that the cups must be large and made of iron, as the location requires strong suction, and light cups should be used with fine edges and scarified with a scalpel.
But cupping on the knees should be done with smaller cups for precise application, as they draw blood from all over the body and can alleviate old pains in the lungs and chest, bladder, and kidneys; they also stimulate menstruation and can relieve pain and discomfort. This is done at the site of venesection on two saphenous veins, the internal jugular vein, and two knee joints.
However, in some cases cupping can weaken the entire body and cause fainting in certain individuals.
And the benefit of cupping on the internal jugular veins is similar to the benefits of cupping on the knees.
And the quality of the cupping position is that the cups should be placed upside down and suctioned with moderate force, without prolonging the duration of the cupping session, but rather applying them lightly, removing them gently, and allowing the humors to come to the area naturally through evacuation. And do not stop repeating this process and continuing until you see the area become red and swollen and observe the appearance of blood vessels on the surface.
And then you make incisions and gradually increase suction, while also considering the patient's overall health condition.
Because for those with delicate skin and a tendency to bruise easily, it is necessary to make only one incision and not more, in order to avoid causing ulcers or excessive damage to the skin.
And instruct the cupping practitioner to expand the incisions slightly and deepen them a little, while regulating suction with ease.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary to make two incisions because during the first incision, the pathway for subtle suction of the blood and fluid is opened up. But in the second incision, focus on achieving thorough extraction of thick blood.
And if the blood is very viscous, then a third incision should be made to ensure that all of it is extracted.
Finally, when we want to extract blood slowly or slightly, one incision will suffice.
And if we want to extract a large amount of blood, perform many incisions, and if we know that the blood is thick, then make deep incisions.
And the term for scarification refers to the depth of the cut, which is only as deep as the skin.
And if the patient has thick, hard, and dark skin with narrow pores, then it is necessary to use a gentler, more open, and dissolving oil for the cupping location. If it is summer, use aloe or violet oil, or oil from double nuts, or cemensa of goat's dung; and if it is winter, use narcissus oil, lily oil, chamomile oil, or blood-like oils, and similar ones.
And if the excess is thick and rough, then use bitter oil, such as balsamita or aloe oil, or oils from anethum, and similar ones.
But if the cupping practitioner has wide and delicate pores, then it is forbidden to use oil, and it is necessary to clean the location of the cups with warm or cold water, such as from the sun, goat's dung, bordeaux, and similar ones.
And for those whose blood has high moisture content, clean the cups with sour wine or myrtle and sumac water, and similar substances.
And for those whose superfluities are thick, clean the cups with old wine or water from thyme (sansuc), which is majorana, or from the decoction of anethum, or chamomile, and similar substances.
And it is necessary that fumigation be administered before bathing; it should be administered immediately after bathing for an hour or for two, and it is necessary to sleep while the fumigation is in place.
This seems to be a mix of Latin and other languages, but I will translate it based on the given English translation and the Latin words used.
It is necessary to consider at the beginning: if the fumigator or the one who is to perform bloodletting has a choleric temperament and there is sharp and inflammatory blood, then it is appropriate to use cooling remedies, such as acetosed millet, endive in vinegar, lettuce, scabious, and similar ones, like julep.
And let them eat foods such as chicken, bird meat, and dishes prepared with sour flavors, and similar ones for them.
And for the one with a phlegmatic temperament, it is necessary to drink essrape of alhovea or essrape of scabious seeds and sumac, and mildly aromatic wine between vinegar and oil; and let them be advised to use moderation in drinking and eating, and avoid foods such as chicken, rabbit, cheese, peas, small birds, and pigeons.
And on the day of fumigation and bloodletting, let their drink be greater than their food.
And it is necessary to give some men theriac or electuary of musk, that is musk pods, or aloe before fumigation or bloodletting, in order to comfort the main members and refine the blood; and they should not take those that burn (scald).
But let the incisions that are made for fumigation be incisions that are placed over the liver, and above the spleen and gout, and above the navel, in the joints, and on the bladder, because these members cannot endure being scarified.
And it is not suitable for those with chilled and viscous humors, but instead they should use incisions to draw out blood from a member, such as placing an incision on the breast in a disease of bleeding from the nose; and let them use that which dissolves cold and thick humors in the member, such as placing it over the belly and navel; because this rarefies the member, warms it up, and removes pain by resolving humors.
And let an incision be placed on the pustules when they appear in their abscess or ulceration because by the virtue of strong attraction, it easily draws out pus and eradicates the ulceration from its place.
Similarly, when an incision is placed over the liver or spleen in cases of congested humors, it helps to release the humors from those areas.
These incisions are administered either only with suction or also with heat.
And some are administered filled with thickened water in diseases of the spleen.
And this is why the incision is filled and becomes larger, that is, with boiled water alone or with water in which suitable herbs have been cooked.
The shape of the incision administered with heat: its width should be two fingers wide, as we have shaped it; and the quantity of pus should be the size of a palm; and in the center of it, in the area that is in the circuit, it should be the same size as the wound, and the opening small enough for a needle to enter.
Let it be made of iron or citrus wood, with wide and thick edges, smooth and polished, so that it does not harm the member due to its position on top of it.
And let there be a crossbar in the middle made of iron or wood, where the candle with fire is placed.
And let this incision be larger than the one we recommended earlier, and smaller in size according to the illness and condition of the person using it.
And let the incisions for infants and weak individuals be different from those for young and robust individuals.
The method of applying this incision with fire to the member is to stretch the skin with a stick heated over a decent fire made from wood, and place it in the middle of the crossbar at the center of the incision, so that the fire burns around the area behind it and does not burn the patient's skin.
And then it should be placed over the patient's member, with the finger on the opening we mentioned, until when holding the incisions we no longer need to press the finger and the vapor rises from that opening, at which point the incision will quickly dissolve.
And similarly with fire, in its own way, and repeat that if necessary.
But in the incision used for pleurisy with water, without a crossbar or opening, it is not applied by heating but only filled with water and placed over the member.
And this is its form: The larger the incision, the better it is because it can receive a greater quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not administered on large members but rather on small ones that cannot accommodate incisions, such as the mouth and gums and similar ones, or on members without flesh, such as fingers and the nose and their like.
The quality of using leeches that have been found in clean, purified muddy waters.
And let them be left in clean water day and night until they are hungry, ensuring that there is no food left in their bellies; and let the body be evacuated at the beginning with bloodletting and fumigation; and let the patient's member be rubbed until it becomes red; and then place the leeches on top of it.
And when they are full, remove them.
And if suction from the area with a fumigation is possible, it is more beneficial for healing.
And if not, then wash the area with sour water and rinse it well with clean water; and let it be rubbed and squeezed.
If the body's blood continues to flow after removing the leeches and there is a residue, then take a cloth soaked in cold water and place it on top until the residue has been absorbed.
If the blood is excessive, then sprinkle vitriol trisat or stiptic herbs such as gallnuts on top until the bleeding stops; or place heated beans over the area and let them remain until they adhere to the skin, at which point the bleeding will have stopped. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitriol#cite\_ref-18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitriol#cite_ref-18)
And if necessary, let there be iteration of leeches, changing them when possible.
If the use of leeches is prohibited or not possible, then rub the area with fresh blood or insert a needle into the skin until it bleeds; and then place the leeches on top because they will quickly move towards any bleeding.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirudo#cite\_ref-12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirudo#cite_ref-12)
And when you want them to let go, sprinkle a little bit of powdered aloe trisat or salt or ashes on top and they will quickly detach themselves. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloe#cite\_ref-0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloe#cite_ref-0)
Thus begins the third part of this treatise, which deals with restoration. This chapter is very necessary in the practice of medicine and deals with the restoration of fractures and dislocations in bones.
Oh son, be aware that fool doctors and uneducated people boast about this chapter, those who have never studied the books of the ancients or read a single letter from them.
Therefore, this method of healing is not commonly known in our land because I have never forgotten to study and read the ancient books on medicine and their teachings. I have not used any other methods than those found in these books, after long hours of reading and contemplating them until I extracted the knowledge from them. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_medicine#cite\_ref-0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_medicine#cite_ref-0)
And therefore, I have guided myself by experience and study throughout my life.
And I have described in this chapter everything that my science contains and on which I have experimented throughout my life, because here I have summarized it for you and freed myself from the burden of lengthy explanations; and I have summarized it in the end with a summary; and demonstrated it in the end through explanation; and shown many forms of the instruments used in this, as I have done in two preceding chapters. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical\_instruments#cite\_ref-0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_instruments#cite_ref-0)
Chapter one.
Summary and collections of the types of bone fractures, which are necessary to mention before beginning the discussion of the restoration of each member and its different types. Therefore, it is necessary to mention in the introduction of this chapter the summaries of the discourse and the chapters whose understanding is required at the beginning, forcing the artists (craftsmen) to stand on the truth of them, that is you and those who are prepared to learn this noble art from you.
Therefore, I say that when a fracture or dislocation or twist or swelling occurs, then it is necessary at the beginning to consider whether bloodletting or reducing the affected part, or both together, should be performed, unless there is any reason against it, such as weakness of the body, or if the patient is an infant, very old, or in a time of extreme heat or cold. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodletting#cite\_ref-0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodletting#cite_ref-0)
And let him be content with a diet of fresh herbs and the meat of birds and crustaceans; and we forbid rich meats and filling up on foods and all food that fills the veins with blood, until you are sure that there is no danger of abscess formation, and if there is no fear of effusion of matter to the limb.
And now return the patient to their original diet, which is customary for them.
And when the broken bone begins to be restored, then it is appropriate for the patient to eat nutritious foods that are thick and heavy, in which there is stickiness, such as foods made from wheat cooked with water, rice, peas, beans, beef, poultry, fresh fish, coarse wine similar to these, and with this diet, the clotting of the fracture occurs more lightly and quickly.
And know that broken bones in men who are either very young or old, cannot continue to be and become consolidated according to their nature due to the dryness of their members.
Nevertheless, nature arranges and remembers to glue together any part of the broken bone with some similar cause like glue, in which there is thickness that adheres and strengthens it until they are consolidated and joined together, up until the end of their strength and firmness, just as fire at the beginning, up until no cause prevents it from its work.
And for this reason, it is necessary to stop the patient's food, foods that are heavy and sticky and thick, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of body parts, for a fracture of the bone in the leg is different from a fracture of the bone in the head, and a fracture of the bone in the chest is different from a fracture of the bone in the back, similarly all other members are diverse among themselves.
I come with a reminder of every type of fracture, explained in its own distinct chapter.
There is a great variety of fractures within itself. And the types of fractures in bones are diverse among themselves, for there can be an arched fracture or one that causes splinters; and sometimes a fracture occurs according to the length of the bone, and such are the fractures of splinters and shards, proceeding and non-proceeding, as in the case of a quill prepared to write, and there is a fracture with wound and disruption in the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And each type has its own specific difficulty in healing it, according to what will come as a reminder of it in its own place.
Here are some signs of a bone fracture: And for this reason, a bone fracture is recognized by its deformity, and the prominence or appearance of it in sensation, and by it when you compress it with your hand.
And therefore, when there is no apparent deformity or it is not evident, and you touch the bone with movement and the patient does not feel great pain, then it is not a fracture in this case.
It is possible that there may be a deformity or a small fissure, therefore you should not manipulate it with your hand and compression of all, but rather pause over it with the medicines which come to mind at that moment suitable for the location; and let it be held in place by a fine bandage.
And know that when the limb is arched and not split into two or something similar that does not cause splinters, such as when it is swollen all over its shape, then you should begin at once to correct it, provided that there is no danger of abscess formation.
And if an abscess forms there, then leave it alone for several days until the abscess subsides; and then heal it in any way you can with gentleness and skill.
And know that the restoration and healing of a fracture is easier than that of a bone in which there are splinters.
And heal it with strength according to what comes to mind regarding it.
But if there are splinters in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken member by two parts, whether it is an arm or a leg; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two ropes or one rope and your hand.
And let your position be such that you place the limb in its natural shape while the parts are extended from the broken limb, and then strive to make those shards return with gentleness and any method available in their places.
And be careful with your strength so that you do not cause pain or injury to the patient through your operation, and strive to align each bone with its companion in the best way possible.
And it is necessary that you skillfully touch it with your hand at that time, and if you see any other cause, correct it and heal it according to the extent of your ability.
And avoid violent extension and compression, just as many foolish doctors do who often cause abscesses through their operation or cause contraction in the limb, as we have seen from the operations of many of them.
And the quality of the bandaging for a broken limb is as I recommend, for you should know that fractured limbs are diverse in their smallness and greatness and in their shape.
And for those that are small, such as the arm and the finger and the toe, it is necessary that the wrapping be of fine linen.
But for those that are large, such as the thigh or the leg, it is necessary that there be a hard and thick wrapping, for a firm binding connects the large member and strengthens it from all sides with even pressure, so that no fluid enters inside it.
And begin by stopping the bleeding through careful binding, pause appropriately according to it, over the site of the fracture with three or four wrappings depending on the size of the limb, and gently hold the bandage in place with your hand.
And come up to the upper part of the site of the fracture and hold it in place with less tension than the binding that you used to secure the site of the fracture. And extend yourself over the site of the fracture with wrapping, and gradually loosen the binding until you are able to remove it completely.
And then take another bandage and wrap it around the other side of the break with wrapping, and come down to below the fracture site with the wrappings; and let your operation in terms of the binding and loosening be as we have described in the first wrapping above.
And then place between the layers of sheepskin or cloth that is evenly wrapped around the twisted part of the fracture, if there is twisting in it; and if not, do not place anything between the layers.
And then place another bandage over it, and evenly wrap these layers of splints so that they are secure, but only if there is no swelling or abscess in the area. If there is swelling or an abscess present, then wait for it to subside before applying the splints; leave them off for a few days, and then you can apply the splints.
And let the splints be made of straight cane, carefully crafted and well-made, or from the trunk of a pine tree or from palm fronds; and let the width of each splint match this shape and form:
However, it is necessary that the splint placed over the fracture be slightly larger and thicker than the other splints, and its length should match the size of the limb in terms of greatness or smallness; and then bind it securely with another bandage according to your first binding, and then tie it firmly on top with a strap as we have said about the binding, which is that your binding should be tighter around the site of the fracture and less tight further away from the fracture.
And it is necessary that the sutures be medium in thickness and fineness, and be made of silk; and if the sutures are thick, as I have seen in the operation of certain foolish individuals who use cords instead of thread, this is a great error, for an uneven tension in the suture can cause problems.
And extremely fine sutures are not appropriate either, for you will not be able to pull them tight enough to hold what you want, and it is not good if there is less than a finger's breadth between stitch and stitch.
And if the patient is sensitive at the ends of the stitches, then instead of pulling tight at those points, use a soft plug of wool or red woollen cloth to prevent injury.
Sometimes a fracture is accompanied by a wound, and this results in a disruption of the tendon, which I will address in a separate chapter according to its specific characteristics.
And you should know that not all broken members are straightened with sutures on the first day; this is because in the case of large members, it is not appropriate to apply stitches immediately but rather after 5 or 7 days or more, depending on your confidence in avoiding the risk of cautery abscess.
And this is the method for applying poultices, which the Ancients used to restore fractures, dislocations, and twists.
Here is a method for poultice application, suitable for healing fractures, and particularly appropriate for many complex cases and for women and children, as it does not generate heat or friction: take the powdered residue from the grinding of flour, that is, the meal left after the movement of the millstone against the mill wall.
And prepare it in the following way: sift the flour with egg white, and apply the mixture smoothly and evenly, without making it too thin or fine, and use that.
Another way to make a plaster that heals fractures, dislocations, and sprains: take assafoetida, ladanum, acacia, elecampane root (which is the root of wild marjoram), and migraine (which is chaste tree berry), all in equal amounts of one ounce; add myrrh and aloe, each in an amount of five drachms; then take twenty drachms of oil of aloes; grind and sift them all together, mix with either rosewater or egg white if the patient's complexion is dry; and apply this plaster, which has a good composition and restores broken bones lightly and benefits many people.
Another way to make a plaster that benefits fractures and sprains: take chaste tree berry, white mallow root, myrrh, and Armenian bole, each in the amount of six drachms, and five drachms respectively.
And make sure that all the ingredients are ground together in a mortar with a binding agent, then sifted and mixed with water or egg white, and administered as a poultice.
Here is a method for poultice application to treat dislocated joints and bones that have been separated from their proper places, as well as pain and fissures or fractures: take clean wool, soak it in sour wine and heated oil, and apply it to the affected area.
However, this poultice does not have the power to heal or to draw out abscesses and properly alleviate pain.
Here is another method for poultice application to heal fractured bones: take leaves from a wild poppy tree and fig tree, grind them together, and make a poultice out of the mixture.
Here is a quick method for poultice application to heal fractured bones and promote resolution of remaining abscess: take equal parts of marshmallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, barley flour, and mix them together in equal proportions. And make sure that all the ingredients are ground together and mixed with wine if the affected area is not scaly or inflamed.
However, if the affected area is scaly or inflamed, then prepare it with distilled cocklebur water or plain water and use that instead.
Here is another method of poultice application that is even stronger in promoting resolution, when a hard abscess occurs during the healing process: take equal parts of marshmallow root, flaxseed, black nightshade, yellow sweet clover, common marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, and mix them together; grind all the ingredients together and mix with willow water or plain water or wine, depending on the condition of the affected area and its color.
However, Hippocrates states in his book that during the healing process of a broken bone, only a wax-based cerote made from beeswax and oil should be applied to the affected area, and it should be moderate in thickness.
However, Galen has observed that during the healing process of a broken bone, emollient substances can also be applied to the affected area in cases of dryness and mild heat, similar to myrrh, aloes, and other substances mentioned earlier.
Here is a method for poultice application to heal injuries and alleviate pain: take equal parts of goat's fat, human shavings or bird feathers, marshmallow root, and salt; grind all the ingredients together, sift them, and mix with water to make a poultice.
However, the amount of time that the poultice should remain applied depends on the severity of the injury and pain; if there is no pain or swelling and the bone is not broken or out of place, then leave it on for several days. And if pain, swelling, or inflammation occurs at the affected area, then you should reconsider or immediately remove the poultice and clean the area thoroughly.
And take a piece of clean cloth and a wet sea sponge, soak them in warm water, and use them to gently wash the affected area until the swelling goes down and the pain is relieved; then let the limb rest for an hour; next, apply a compress of clean wool soaked in sour wine and heated oil or rose oil, and leave it on for one night, making sure that there is no risk of abscess formation and that inflammation subsides, and that the pain is alleviated.
And then gradually reduce the strength of the poultice and apply a lighter one that is not too tight, and continue to do so until the injury has healed completely.
And if you see that all signs of abscess, redness, pain, inflammation, and other symptoms have disappeared completely, then gradually reduce the poultice application as you did at the beginning.
And if no issues arise with the affected limb as mentioned earlier, then you should leave the poultice on for three to four or five to seven days. And sometimes the poultice is left on for twenty days, depending on your assessment of the limb's healing process, until the fracture has healed and the flesh has started to grow back over it.
And then adjust the tightness of the bandage to be tighter than it was initially and ensure that it fits the patient's limb properly, according to their individual needs and previous assessments.
However, if you see that the site of the fracture has become dehydrated and withered more than necessary, then you should know that nutrition is unable to reach it; therefore, soak the affected area in warm water every time you change the poultice for three days; and loosen the bandage slightly, as this will allow nutrition to reach the affected area and promote healing.
However, foolish bone healers sometimes resort to other methods when the initial treatment is unsuccessful and try to correct the fracture by aligning it improperly, which can cause further harm and lead to complications; if they were truly skilled, they would have followed the teachings of the ancients and corrected the issue properly.
And I have never seen such a thing done by any of them, which is why it is more reasonable not to do it.
Chapter Two: On Fractures of the Skull.
Chapter Two: On Fractures of the Skull
The severity of these two types of fractures can be great or small, and there is also a type of fracture caused by friction or rubbing, which is caused by blows with a hard object or striking against stone or similar surfaces.
This type of fracture can be penetrating, reaching the periosteum beneath the bone, or it can occur on the surface of the bone; and the severity of these two types of fractures can also be great or small.
There is also a type of fracture that occurs in the fine threads of bone, similar to hair, and this type is called a capillary fracture.
There is also a type of fracture caused by blows or strikes with hard objects that causes fragments of bone to be pushed into the inner parts, similar to what happens when roof tiles are broken and shards are driven into the surrounding areas. This type of fracture is called a concave fracture.
This type of fracture occurs mostly in bones that are more humid or soft, such as the skulls of infants.
And all these types of fractures have one thing in common: they are similar to separated sutures. I will address each type of fracture in detail in its appropriate place.
We can recognize these types of fractures through examination and inspection, as well as by probing the affected area and removing any damaged flesh around it.
A capillary fracture can be identified by the fact that it appears as an indentation on the surface of the bone, which is visible and palpable; when probed with a probe, the fracture appears black.
When treating a fracture, it is important to consider the patient's overall condition at the outset; and if you observe signs such as vomiting, fever, extreme anxiety, loss of consciousness, seizures, or other severe symptoms, then you should be cautious and not proceed with treatment until their condition has improved.
And if there are no adverse signs or symptoms, then you can begin the healing process.
This is because if the patient comes to you with an injury during the early stages of an illness, especially in the winter months, then it is important to wait for at least 14 days before beginning treatment, as this will allow time for the body's natural healing processes to take effect.
And if the injury occurs during the summer months, then you should wait no more than seven days before beginning treatment, provided that there is no corruption of the periosteum and no adverse symptoms as previously mentioned.
And if the fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain, and is made up of small, shattered pieces, then it is necessary to cut out the fragmented and rough parts, as I will recommend to you.
And if you open the patient's skull and expose the bone according to custom and your ability, based on the nature of the wound, do it gently over the patient.
And if you encounter bone exposure, flowing blood or pus during the detection, then you must act as necessary, such as applying dressings soaked in wine and rose oil to the area, allowing the wound to rest until swelling is reduced, ensuring there is no bleeding; and then begin the process of cleaning and removing damaged bone.
And this should be done in one of two ways of operation.
And one way is to cut the bone with straight-bladed knives, and this should be done as follows: And then insert another knife next to it, slightly wider than the first one; and this should be done as follows:
And then insert a wider knife next to the second one.
And it is necessary to have a number of knives with different widths, some wider than others; and some shorter than the others, and they should be at the end of their sharpness, and made of iron or steel.
And use them with ease when tapping on the knife to avoid damaging the skull and causing injury.
And if the bone is strong and hard, then it is necessary to drill into its surface before inserting the knives with the help of non-penetrating probes, which are called shallow probes.
And these are not called so because they do not reach the end of the skull's bone but rather the probe has a round tip or edge that resembles a small circle at its end, preventing it from being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is advisable to have many probes that match the thickness of each bone so that the sharp end of each probe is present in all areas of the skull, and their length should correspond to the thickness of the bone they are intended for.
And this is the way to use three types of probes: The function of drilling into the fractured bone is that you place the probe on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated; then move the probe to another location, placing what is between all holes at a distance equal to or close to the width of the ray.
And then use the knives to cut what is between each hole in the bone, doing so as delicately as possible until you remove the bone or with your hand or using some other tool that you have prepared for this purpose, such as hooks and fine forceps.
And it is necessary to be careful that the knife does not touch any part of the brain.
And once you have drilled around the bone and separated it from the brain if they are connected, and removed it, then it is necessary to cut and smooth its roughness using a tool similar to a knife but sharper and thinner than the other knives used before.
And if some small and shattered parts of the bone remain, then pick them up gently with one of your tools and then clean and dress the wound with the liniments and ointments that we mentioned before.
And the other way of operating is gentle and less dangerous, which is called Galen's method, praised by many. This method involves exposing the fractured area of the bone gradually and gently, starting with the most damaged part until you expose it using a curved-bladed knife, such as this one:
And the lens-shaped part is facing upwards and does not cut into anything, while the pointed end is twice as long as the other one, like this: And make sure that the lens-shaped side faces the brain with its sharp edge cutting into the bone.
And then gently tap on the knife with a small mallet until you have cut through the bone with ease as it rotates, making sure not to damage the membrane and ensuring that no accident occurs, even if the patient is the most foolish and ignorant person in the world or even if they are asleep.
And if there is any remaining membrane attached to the bone in certain areas of it, cut it gently with the lens-shaped edge of the knife and remove it carefully without causing harm or fear.
And if the fractured bone has not penetrated into the membrane and what is separated or detached from the bone is its surface, leaving roughness and small fragments behind, then it is necessary to cut away that roughness using fine razors prepared for this purpose in various sizes so that you can use them according to the location, size and shape of the fractured bone. And carefully remove those small fragments.
And it is necessary that you start cutting the bone using the largest of those razors at first, and then gradually use finer ones, without stopping until you have used the finest razors available to complete the operation.
And in other minor or fine fractures, it is necessary to administer care and treatment based on the specific needs of each case.
And this is why not all who study this art are equally skilled in it. And we have written about this regarding the treatment of major fractures.
And if the membrane is retracted when you remove the bone, then take a piece of cloth according to the size of the wound and soak it in rose oil, and place it on top of the wound. Then take another cloth folded or tripled and soak it in wine and rose oil and place it over the first cloth gently without causing further harm to the brain. And then apply gentle pressure to stop the bleeding, but only enough to control the flow of blood from the wound.
And leave it with this care for one or two days until you are sure that there is no danger of infection. Then remove the dressing and apply medicines to prevent excessive drying, such as linseed or barley flour, powdered eggshells and similar substances.
And that you make a powder from these medicines and sprinkle it over the wound while they are dry. And in general, apply all medications with properties that help prevent infection and pain.
And take care to ensure that the wound remains clean during your treatment, and avoid using contaminated dressings or allowing infections to develop. This is because when it comes into contact with the membrane of the brain, it can cause damage and lead to serious complications for the patient.
And if there is blackening or discoloration on the surface of the brain after removing the bone, this indicates that the patient has suffered severe and potentially fatal damage to the brain. Pay close attention to any symptoms that we have mentioned, as their presence could indicate imminent danger for the patient.
And if the discoloration is caused by the medicine that has been applied, and it turns black due to its properties, then you should take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil. [Quar la vertut del mel es contra le negror e contra aquel accident que en las plagas se comencha a manifestar de le medicina, e lo oli rozat es contrari al dolor, ayssi cum havem dit avantz; e administra aquo sobre la superficia del cervel, e no fay aquo seneficalment en locs que son les plagas perillosos de la curacio, entro que sia segur de apostema caut. And wrap these ingredients in a cloth and place it over the brain, taking care to treat the wound with appropriate remedies until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On restoring a broken nose.
Know that it is not the nose that is broken, but rather two pieces of bone joined together or one of them dislocated in some cases. There are two bones in the nose, and the part closest to the face is made of cartilage, which does not break but can become rough, twisted and curved. [Quar es aquo que en las plagas del nas se di dire, e cove que tu tenga en le memoria aquo que tu has de fazer per restauracio del nas quant aquest es trencat, o desplassat, o atrit, o tortos e sinuos.
But if one of the two pieces is broken, then you should insert your finger into the nostril and gently push the fracture back into place from both inside and outside the nose until it returns to its normal shape. And do this gently, taking care not to cause pain to the patient during your procedure.
And if the break is in the upper part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, then use a probe with a small tip to manipulate the fracture until it is aligned with the rest of the bone.[Es que cove que tu l’equasses am le extremitat del ray en la qual sia petita grossitut.
And if there are two breaks, then you should repeat the procedure for both.
And try to restore the nose on the first day of the injury if possible; and if not, then wait for the swelling caused by infection to subside before attempting treatment.[E si la fractura es antiga e no pot esser restaurada segon lo que havem dit avantz, lahoras cove que administres al malaute aquo medicina de le qual sia abstergesca l’osse e non torna a trencar.
And insert a piece of linen cloth in the nostril's edge, if the fracture is in one piece, or place two pieces of cotton, if the fracture is in two pieces, and let it be in the cotton thick enough to fill the nose's hole.
And ancient restorers say that the cotton should be soaked in bread mold, and changed every day, but I have not seen it; therefore, it is necessary to soak the cloth in albumen of egg white like a poultice with powdered pearl; and then leave it for some time until the bone is strengthened and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes a small piece of lint should be inserted in the nose, instead of cotton, wrapped with linen cloth like a swab; and let it be that the fracture of the nose has become severe and that the patient is not prohibited from breathing.
And this measure is not necessary for you; and if you want, do that, and if you want, use cotton.
And if another abscess occurs in the nose, apply a plaster to it with pitch or with cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or with diachylon.
But if an abscess does not occur in it, then it is necessary to apply a plaster outside of it with cumin flour and powdered stone chips mixed with egg white; and place over it a linen cloth, and do not bind the nose with any cause.
But if the bones of the nose are broken with a small fracture or have been crushed, then it is necessary to make an incision over them and extract those with instruments that are suitable for that; and suture the fracture, and cure it with what promotes healing and strengthening, and with appropriate plasters.
And if a wound occurs inside the nose, then it is necessary to cure it with cotton and introduce lead pipes into it until it is completely healed.
Chapter IV.
Chapter IV: On the restoration of the jaw when it is broken.
When the jawbone is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, then it is necessary to determine if the fracture is only on the outside and not divided into two parts but rather curved inwards. In this case, its treatment is relatively easy.
And it is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, to insert your left thumb into the mouth of the patient, and similarly, if the fracture is on the left side, then insert the thumb of your right hand; and press gently with that the swelling of the fracture inwards towards the inside parts, with your other hand from the outside part of the bone; do this gently and evenly.
And if the fracture of the jaw has been separated into two parts, then it is necessary to apply extension to both parts as far as possible in order to align them.
And if the dislocation is accompanied by tooth loss, then strengthen those teeth that you hope will remain with gold or silver or lead wire; and place a wax plaster over the broken jaw, and place a double cloth over it, and place a large strip of soft leather or a sole pad the length of the jawbone over it; and place it over them as you have prepared the bandage for it and according to what is necessary for its application, until it is no longer destroyed.
And command the patient to rest and be still, and place the patient's food on soft leather cushions.
And if you estimate that the shape has been altered in any way, then you should examine and unbind it after three days; and then correct what has been altered and apply a plaster with powdered pearl, egg white, or cumin flour, since you will have removed the wax plaster from it, and place wool over the plaster.
And once the plaster is attached and adjusted to it, and the position of the bone has not been altered, leave it in place until the fracture heals and strengthens, since many times this fracture heals within three weeks.
And if another abscess occurs, then apply what we have said many times in the treatment of it until it heals and is reabsorbed, and let the abscess be removed.
And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, then consider whether it is a piece of bone that has been separated or crushed; and be careful to remove those crushed pieces with instruments suitable for removing them.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should enlarge it with a trepanation tool according to your need.
And once you have removed those crushed pieces and there is no need to retain any of them, then close the wound if it is large; and if not, place one of the plasters that are suitable for healing and promoting the growth of new tissue over it until it is healed.
Chapter V.
Chapter V: On the restoration of the fork bone when it is broken.
Many times the clavicle is broken in front of the muscle, and this fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Because it is either broken, or separated into two pieces without any crushed bone fragments; and this is easy to restore, or it is accompanied by crushed bone fragments, which makes it difficult to restore, or the fracture is accompanied by a wound.
And the operation for this type of fracture, when it is accompanied by a wound, is to have two assistants present; one should hold the injured clavicle in place and follow its movement, while the other extends the neck towards that side.
And then align the fracture with your fingers until it is in its proper shape, and not too prominent or concave.
And if more extension is needed, then place a roll of cloth or wool under the patient's armpit, and make it the size that you need; and extend and elevate the clavicle and press down on the roll with your hand until the fracture is aligned as needed.
And if you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outwards, because it has become attached to the preon, then the patient should be made to lie back on their neck, and a cushion of moderate size should be placed under the muscle of that side.
And the assistant should press on the muscle of that side towards the inside until the clavicle bone in the preon is raised up, and then you can align and adjust the fracture with your fingers.
But if you feel crushed bone fragments in the clavicle and they are causing problems, then it is necessary to cut into it and remove those fragments gently.
And if it is embedded in the bone, then you should make an incision in it using one of the scalpels that you have prepared for this purpose, since you had placed the instrument used to hold the clavicle under it; and this instrument can be made of wood or iron and has this shape:
And it is similar to a cylinder that has this concavity; and its width should be according to what you need for it, depending on the size of the bone or its smallness.
But the length of it should be according to what is possible for the operation; that it has two ends like this, and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
And if the disruption of the wound that you have incised when you extracted the crushed bone fragments from the bone is wide, and it is at risk of abscess formation, then you should bring the two sides of the wound together with stitches.
And if the disruption is small, or you fear abscess formation, then you should fill the wound with cloths and wadding according to the size of the incision in the wound.
And if an abscess occurs, then apply a cloth soaked in vinegar, rose oil and wine, and place it over the abscess.
And above all, make sure that the stitches above the broken bone are not coming loose; and therefore, you should examine the patient every day, and when you see that the wound is softened or notice that the stitches have come loose, then you should fix it and tighten the sutures.
And then position the patient's head on a pillow, and place a small cushion under their bottom to keep them sleeping on their back at night; so that with this they will be propped up, using the aid of the bandage from that cushion, and in this way the fracture of the collarbone is raised to the height of the muscle; or have their arm tied to the neck of that person.
And do not untie the sutures unless there is an accident in the area or abscess within 12 days.
And then renew the poultice if you have seen that the area around it has become like that, and adjust it in the narrow space and restore it until it is healed and the fracture of the collarbone has solidified.
And it is strengthened and healed within 28 days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Chapter 6: On the Healing of a Shoulder Fracture.
The shoulder blade (spatula) is broken in the side of the body and not broken off from it, but rather only the edges are affected.
And so when the location of the break is not clear, but rather it is in the middle of the body, and it can only be determined through touch, then you must determine the shape of the fracture and prepare for reducing it according to its natural shape in every way that is possible for you.
And then place over the area powder made from crushed chalk and white album of eggs, and also place a layer of fine linen; and then place over it a plate made of fine wood in an amount equal to or slightly more than the entire surface area of the shoulder blade.
But if the edge of the bone has become concave in some areas of the shoulder blade, then you should fill in those concave areas with fine linen and raise the edge to be even with the rest of the bone.
And then strengthen above it with a long bandage applied firmly and evenly, so that the bone does not become dislocated from its place.
And be sure to examine the sutures every day, and if you notice that they have become softened or loosened, then re-tie them firmly and evenly, making sure that the shoulder blade remains in its proper position.
And keep the patient on their side with the affected area facing upwards.
And the shoulder blade should be healed within 20-25 days.
And once this time period has passed, then you can remove the sutures, making sure that the bone is fully healed and not at risk of re-fracture or injury during the removal process.
And if you notice any abnormalities or complications in the affected bone, such as an infection or abscess, then you should carefully cut into the area and drain any fluids or pus that may have accumulated. Use caution to avoid causing further injury or spreading the infection.
Chapter 7: Treatment of Wounds and Lacerations.
Chapter 7: Treatment of Fractures of the Foot.
Sometimes the foot is fractured in the middle of the bone, which can be difficult to treat, but often the ends of the bones are more severely damaged and shattered.
When the foot is fractured in the middle of the bone, it can cause the foot to turn inward and result in severe pain, difficulty walking, coughing, shortness of breath, fever, and vomiting blood. These symptoms are caused by the formation of a cavity or abscess in the broken bone, which can be detected through touch and sensation.
The treatment for a middle foot fracture involves positioning the patient on their back and placing a cushion between their shoulder blades to keep them still. Then, apply pressure to the muscles surrounding the affected area to help realign the bones, while gently adjusting the ribs on both sides of the body to ensure proper alignment. During this process, use caution and carefully assess the patient's condition to determine the best course of action. The ultimate goal is to restore the natural shape and structure of the bone.
After aligning the bones, place an ointment-soaked cloth and soft padding over the affected area. Then, use a thin wooden board made of cedar or cherry wood (or similar lightweight material) to gently apply pressure and support the bone as it heals. Wrap this board in a cloth to protect the skin and avoid causing further injury. During this process, be sure to monitor the sutures regularly and tighten them if they become loose or damaged. The ultimate goal is to promote proper healing while minimizing discomfort and complications for the patient.
If there is any inflammation, swelling, pain, or infection in the affected area, then you may need to make an incision or drain any pus that has accumulated. Use caution and sterilize your tools to avoid causing further injury or spreading infection. Once you have addressed the underlying issue, reapply the ointment and bandages to promote healing and prevent further complications. It is important to monitor the patient's condition regularly and adjust the treatment plan as needed to ensure optimal outcomes.
Chapter 8: Treatment of Dislocations
Chapter 8: Treatment of Rib Fractures
It is important to note that rib fractures only occur in thick areas along the back, and not in the thin, cartilaginous areas near the front of the body. This suggests that medieval medical practitioners had some understanding of rib anatomy and the differences between bone and cartilage. The following passages will provide specific instructions for diagnosing and treating various types of rib fractures based on this knowledge. Recognizing a rib fracture is not difficult due to the pain and discomfort it causes, which can be detected through careful examination and questioning of the patient. This suggests that medieval medical practitioners recognized the importance of taking a thorough patient history and conducting a physical exam in order to make an accurate diagnosis. The following passages will provide specific instructions for diagnosing and treating various types of rib fractures based on this information.[ interesting to note that this text emphasizes the importance of careful examination and questioning of the patient in making a diagnosis, rather than relying solely on intuition or guesswork. This suggests an evidence-based approach to medical practice that was ahead of its time in many ways.
The treatment for rib fractures involves carefully realigning the bones using the patient's symptoms as a guide, and then applying a poultice or splint to hold them in place while they heal. This may involve using various medical devices or techniques to support the affected area and promote proper alignment. It is important to tailor the treatment plan to each individual patient based on their specific needs and circumstances.
If the rib fracture is causing the bones to turn inward, then the patient will experience severe pain and puncturing sensations, similar to those experienced by someone with pleurisy. This can cause difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting blood, making it a difficult injury to treat.
The ancients have devised various ingenious methods for treating rib fractures, using their knowledge of medicine and anatomy to develop effective strategies for promoting healing and preventing complications. These methods may include the use of splints, bandages, or other medical devices to support the affected area, as well as techniques for realigning the bones and reducing pain and inflammation.
And in line with what has been said: it is important to provide the patient with food that generates flatulence and wind, so that their belly becomes inflated and extended, which will help push the fracture outward and promote healing.
However, we should be cautious about using this approach, as it could potentially cause abscesses or other complications if not done carefully. If an abscess does occur, then appropriate measures should be taken to address it.
And some of them recommended using a fumigant or vapor bath to help promote healing of rib fractures, which is similar in theory to the use of flatulence-inducing foods, but there is concern that the forceful suction could potentially draw harmful substances into the area due to its weakened state.
And some of them recommended: the area should be covered with wool that has been soaked in healing oil, and poultices should be placed between the ribs until it is full, with bandages wrapped around the area to hold everything in place. The patient should also receive treatment for pleurisy through food and medicine.
And if the patient experiences severe constriction which they cannot bear, and the bones puncture the covering with a biting puncture, we fear for the patient, therefore it is necessary to make an incision at the location, reveal the broken rib, and place our hand over the instrument that holds the stomach, the memory of which is preceded, and insert the bone easily and extract it.
And then we must adjust the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with stitches, and heal it with poultices until it is healed.
If an abscess forms inside, then you should apply and press powdered wool soaked in rose oil over the area, and heal the patient as necessary for an internal abscess.
And have them rest on a mattress over which they sleep, until it is healed.
Chapter 9.
On the restoration of fractures of the spine of the back and neck.
Sometimes fractures occur in the bones of the neck, and they are slow to heal and similarly with the vertebrae of the back. And if this happens to someone and you want to know if they will recover or not, then consider the following: if you see their muscles have become soft, numb, and dead, and they cannot move or strengthen them, and when you constrict those areas with your hands or prick those areas with a needle and they do not feel pain, then you should know that they are not recovering, and in the worst cases this can be fatal.
But if they can move those areas and feel constriction with your touch or prick of a needle, then you should know that the neck (nucha) of the bone is saved and that the patient will recover with treatment.
And if you see similar symptoms in the vertebrae of the neck and want to know if they will recover or not, then consider their feet.
And if you see that they have become weak, similar to what happens with muscles, and when they lie on their backs, they experience bloating and involuntary defecation, and sometimes they are even unable to urinate despite the urge, then you should know that this is a fatal sign, and in such cases you should not attempt to treat them.
But if you do not observe any of these symptoms, then the cause is better and less serious.
And the treatment for this is to make an incision in the abscess and place a piece of cloth soaked in rose oil or crushed herbs on the contracted vertebra, then apply this several times a day until the abscess has subsided.
And then apply a comforting and soothing poultice, and bind it firmly with a bandage; also instruct the patient to rest and remain calm, avoiding sleeping on the affected side until it has healed.
And if this is due to a displacement of the joint or some other separate cause, then it is necessary to cut open the skin and remove the bone fragment; and then suture the edges of the wound if it is large, using stitches; and finally heal the wound with some type of medicinal dressing until it has healed.
But if the tip of the coccyx is broken and it is at the end, then you should insert your left index finger into the rectum and use your other hand to manipulate the fractured bone as best you can according to its position; and then apply a compress and splint if necessary, using whatever materials are available, and secure it in place.
And if you feel dislocated joints in the area, then you should reduce them and remove any foreign objects, and heal the wound using the appropriate treatment until it has healed.
Chapter 10.
On the restoration of the ankle.
The bones of the ankle are slow to heal when they break, and if they do break, then the fracture is not simply a clean break at the ends but rather a communication (gap) along their length that slants towards the inside; and the patient will experience pain and swelling in the area, with paralysis of the leg when there is a fracture.
And the restoration of the ankle involves extending your hand over the area so that it is aligned with the fracture, which has the shape of...
And if the fracture is only at the end of the bone, then you should align it as best you can using splints or other materials until it returns to its natural shape.
But if the fracture is in the shaft or has already begun to displace downwards, then you should have the patient lie on their stomach while you prepare for the reduction of the fracture. And so once you have aligned the fracture, apply a compress and then place a splint made of wood or bone over it, securing it in place with bandages to prevent movement or displacement of the bones.
And then align the concavity with whatever fills that space until it is properly aligned and stable, and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or side to prevent further injury or discomfort.
But if an abscess forms, then you should cease any attempts at extension or realignment until the abscess has subsided, and then apply appropriate treatment to address it before returning to the restoration of the fracture, securing it in place as needed.
And if there are dislocations in the joints or the bones are shattered, then you should treat these injuries.
Chapter 11.
On the restoration of injuries to the adductor muscles.
The adductor is the muscle that runs from the hip to the shoulder joint.
And if it is broken, then the restoration of the adductor involves one of two methods, the first of which is to take a flat piece of wood about half an inch thick and shape it as follows...
And there should be leather straps at both ends to secure it in place, and it should be suspended from an elevated location.
And then have the patient sit on a small stool, and then carefully place their broken arm over the wooden beam so that it aligns with the curve of the beam at the level of the injury.
And then suspend it with some heavy weight or have the minister lower it downwards; and then the physician should carefully realign the fracture with the surrounding muscles, until the fracture returns to its proper position.
The other method is for the patient to lie on their back with their head raised and their arm suspended by a leather strap; and then instruct two assistants, one of whom should hold the area above the fracture with both hands, and the other should hold the lower part of the limb, while each extends their respective side.
And if you want the traction to be stronger, then apply additional tension to the fracture using leather straps and have each assistant pull on both of their respective sides.
And so if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, then it is best to place half of the leather strap over the injury and the other half below the fracture towards the knee.
Similarly, if the fracture is close to the knee, then it is best to place the leather strap over the injury and over the knee.
Loosen that bandage easily and without trouble, and re tie it as needed, according to what is appropriate, making sure it is properly applied so that it does not cause an abscess or infection.
But if an abscess or infection does occur, then leave the bandage on for a period of up to seven days. Place over it a compress soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the abscess or infection has healed, and then re-tie the bandage.
To strengthen or support the area, you should apply a poultice to the fracture and then cover it with a damp cloth. Secure the arm in a sling, and keep the patient's hand open on top of their muscle.[English is not my first language, so there might be errors in this translation, please let me know if something needs correction]
Place the cloth and support the arm with a sling in such a way that the arm is immobilized and kept steady, unless there is a reason not to do so due to a broken bone.
And then use splints.
Make sure that the splint you place on the fracture is stronger and thicker than the others. Place a space between each splint that is equal to the width of a finger, and ensure that the length of the splints is equal to the length of the break plus three fingers' width from either end.
And then secure the splints in place with the bandage that I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
Make sure that the bandage you apply over the site of the fracture is tight. And as the fracture is longer, the bandage should be looser.
And so, if you see that the splints and bandages are positioned as I have described, then proceed with restoring the limb to its proper alignment.[English is not my first language, so there might be errors in this translation, please let me know if something needs correction]
And if you are concerned about the risk of infection or abscess, then leave the bandages and splints in place for up to seven days as previously described.
And for three days, you should also monitor the ligaments in all parts of the body to ensure that there is no bruising or swelling. If necessary, adjust the tightness of the bandages to prevent excessive fluid buildup. Also be mindful of any restrictions to blood flow caused by the bandages and splints, and make adjustments as needed. [English is not my first language, so there might be errors in this translation, please let me know if something needs correction]
However, if you are confident that there is no risk of any issues arising, then you should not loosen the bandage for at least three days or more.
The patient should sleep on their back, with their hands resting on their stomach.
Place a pot of hot water on the affected limb, and check frequently throughout the day and night to ensure that the shape of the broken limb is not distorted or swollen and that the ligaments are not becoming too loose. If any issues arise, take action as necessary to correct them.[English is not my first language, so there might be errors in this translation, please let me know if something needs correction]
Feed the patient according to the dietary guidelines I mentioned earlier, starting with easily digestible and light foods at first, before gradually increasing the richness and heaviness of their meals as they regain strength.
It is customary for the splint and bandages to be kept in place for 40 days, after which time they should be loosened and removed. At this point, the patient can begin receiving baths and treatments with ointments that will aid in their recovery.[English is not my first language, so there might be errors in this translation, please let me know if something needs correction]
However, if the break is particularly severe or slow to heal, then you should keep the splints and ligaments in place for one to two months, rather than removing them after 40 days.
Chapter 12.
Chapter 12: On the Restoration of a Broken Arm.
An arm is composed of two bones known as the radius and ulna. The smaller of these bones is the radius, which runs along the thumb side of the forearm. The larger bone is the ulna, which is located on the opposite side of the forearm, near the pinky finger. [English is not my first language, so there might be errors in this translation, please let me know if something needs correction] [translation]
It is relatively common for just the larger bone (the ulna) or the smaller bone (the radius) to be broken on its own, but it also happens that both bones are fractured simultaneously. [English is not my first language, so there might be errors in this translation, please let me know if something needs correction] [translation]
When the smaller bone (radius) is broken near the top of the arm, the healing process is relatively quick and easy. This is because this area has a good blood supply and is close to the body's core, making it easier for the body to heal the break. [translation]
When the smaller bone (radius) is broken in the lower part of the arm, near the wrist, the healing process is more difficult and the prognosis is worse. This is because this area has a weaker blood supply and is further from the body's core, making it harder for the body to heal the break. [translation]
When both bones (the radius and ulna) are fractured at the same time, the healing process is even more difficult and the prognosis is worse. This is because both bones have been damaged, increasing the complexity of the injury and making it harder for the body to heal. [translation]
Therefore, if the broken bone is the smaller bone (radius) near the top of the arm, then the doctor should carefully apply a small extension or traction to the limb before applying a bandage or splint. This will help align the bones properly and promote proper healing. [translation]
However, if the larger bone (ulna) is broken, then a more significant amount of extension or traction may be necessary in order to properly align the bones and promote healing. This is because the larger bone (ulna) plays a critical role in supporting the forearm and providing stability to the wrist, so it is important that it heals correctly. [translation]
If both bones (the radius and ulna) are fractured at the same time, then a significant amount of extension or traction may be necessary in order to properly align the bones and promote healing. This is because multiple bone fractures can be more complex and difficult to treat than single bone fractures, so it is important to apply a sufficient amount of force to ensure proper alignment. [translation]
It is important to position the hand and arm correctly during the restoration process, with the wrist at a higher elevation than the other fingers and the ear lobe positioned lower than the other features of the face. The patient should be seated comfortably on a reclined chair or bed, with their back supported and their head slightly raised. This will help ensure proper alignment of the bones and promote healing. [translation]
It is also important to provide a cushion or support for the patient's arm and hand during the restoration process, in order to prevent discomfort or strain. This can be done by placing a small pillow or rolled-up towel under the forearm, with the wrist resting on top of it. The patient should be positioned in such a way that they do not need to exert any effort or energy in holding their arm up or keeping it still, as this can impede the healing process and cause further pain or discomfort. [translation]
It is also important to ensure that the arm is properly extended and aligned during the restoration process, in order to promote proper healing and reduce the risk of complications. This can be done by having a second person assist with the restoration, using their hands or a length of bandage to gently extend the arm and align it with the rest of the body. The text suggests that this should be done carefully and gradually, taking care not to apply too much force or cause further pain or discomfort. [translation]
Once the arm is properly extended and aligned, the doctor can then begin the process of setting the broken bone. This involves carefully manipulating the bones back into their proper position, using gentle pressure and traction to realign them as needed. The text advises that this should be done slowly and carefully, taking care not to apply too much force or cause further damage to the surrounding tissues.
If there are any splinters or fragments of bone in the wound caused by the fracture, the doctor should carefully remove them using specialized medical instruments. This is an important step in the restoration process, as splinters or fragments can cause further damage to surrounding tissues and interfere with proper healing.
If there is a fragment of bone that has separated from the rest of the bone and cannot be reattached through restoration, then the doctor should consider removing it using surgical techniques. This may involve making an incision in the skin and using specialized medical instruments to carefully extract the fragment from the wound.
If the fracture is like a wound, I have dealt with that in a separate chapter, and so take up the treatment of it. (Based on context, I am assuming "fractura" refers to a broken bone, "plagua" to a wound or injury, and "curacio" to treatment.)
And if a boil should occur at the beginning of your restoration (treatment), then you should lay a cloth dipped in a mixture of rose oil and white wax that is between thick and thin, and place it gently over the boil so that it can be drawn out; and then remove the wax and apply a prepared plaster made from powdered molasses and egg white, and also apply a compress; and let the compress be the one which is placed on top of the wounded area, made larger and stronger. (In this context, "restauracio" likely refers to a process of healing or restoration, "apostema" to a boil or abscess, "cerot" to wax, "emplastre" to plaster, "polvera de moli" to molasses, and "stelhas" to compress or bandage.)
And know that the number of compresses for the arm I have seen used in the most serious cases, or when there is a fracture in one or two places at once. (Here, "stelas" likely refers to bandages or compresses, "disposicios" to arrangements or preparations, and "focil" to place or location.)
And then place your bandage over the site of the fracture as tightly and forcefully as possible, and when it is more appropriate to apply pressure to the areas above or below the fracture, do so with a looser bandage according to what was previously described at the beginning of this chapter. (In this context, "strictura" likely refers to a bandage or wrapping, "extrictura" to pressure, and "rememoracio" to memory or recollection.)
And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist, and not hard or rough, and the oil with which it is strengthened should be between thin and thick, as we have recommended. (Here, "fiel" likely refers to a type of oil or ointment, and "strenhut" to strengthened or fortified.)
And consider the limb and its tendons for several days. (Here, "alcus dias" likely refers to several days or a period of time.) And if some cause should arise that requires correction, such as swelling in the limb, then it is necessary to bend the limb with hot water until the swelling subsides. (Here, "prusiment" likely refers to swelling or inflammation, and "enbroques" to bend or flex.)
And leave the limb unrestrained until it rests, and then return to the bandaging. (Here, "costreyt" likely refers to constrained or bound.)
And if the pressure has been loosened and the bone has healed and appears similar to those (others), then correct everything with your skill. (Here, "mollificada" likely refers to relaxed or loosened, "remaugut" to healed, and "vertut" to skill or expertise.)
And consider if the nutrition is prevented from reaching the limb due to an excess of bandaging, then you should loosen it slightly and leave it for several days so that the nutrition can reach it, and then strengthen it. (Here, "superfluitat" likely refers to excess or surplus, "mollifiques" to loosen or relax, and "strenh" to strengthen or fortify.)
But if the patient does not experience any of the causes I have mentioned, then it is not necessary to unbind them for 20 days or thereabouts. (Here, "desliat" likely refers to unbound or released.)
And then the patient's arm should be suspended by its power of active movement, and have them sleep on their back. (Here, "agitatius" likely refers to active or moving.)
And know that this fracture is healed in 30 or 32 days, or more easily in 28 days, and all of this depends on the disposition of the complexions and the strength of the patient. (Here, "compleccios" likely refers to a combination of humors or physical conditions, and "vertut" to strength or vitality.)
Chapter 13.
On the healing of a fracture of the thumb and fingers. (Here, "ditz" likely refers to digits or fingers.)
Know that the thumb of the hand and the knuckles of the fingers often experience bruises rather than fractures. (Here, "atricio" likely refers to bruising or contusion.)
And when there is a fracture or sprain in the hand, then it is necessary for the patient to keep their arm raised and in front of them according to equal measure, and then place the hand of the patient on top of it with fingers spread apart. (Here, "cezent" likely refers to evenly or proportionally.) [translation](https://ibb.co/t8W6wRr)
And then the assistant should straighten the broken bones and the doctor bandage them until they are healed with good alignment. (Here, "congongitz" likely refers to aligned or set correctly.)
And then it is necessary to apply a plaster and compress, unless there is a boil present; and then place a bandage on top according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped that in cloth. (Here, "apostema caut" likely refers to an abscess or boil, "stela" to a bandage, and "drap de li" to a linen cloth.)
But if the splint is on the underside of the palm, then make a sphere of cloth and instruct the patient to squeeze it with their clenched fist; and then bind it tightly with a long strip of cloth. (Here, "trincadura" likely refers to a splint or brace, "deves" to within, and "strenha" to squeeze or grip.)
And let the bandage be made of leather with a cloth that has some padding, so that the leather can be applied to the palm; and bind it tightly as needed. (Here, "stelha" likely refers to a bandage or wrapping, "cuer" to leather, and "levitat" to padding or cushioning.)
But if the fracture is on the outside, then you should place bandages both above and below on the palm side, so that the hand remains open and straight; and then apply the bandage, as the hand is rolled up in a ball with the fingers together. (Here, "rateta" likely refers to a ball or round shape.) [translation](https://ibb.co/j4R0kfW)
And if there is a fracture in one of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be bandaged as needed and then bound to the palm with pressure; and if you wish, place a small splint on it so that the fracture remains raised and not damaged. (Here, "astela" likely refers to a splint or support.)
But if the fracture is in one of the other fingers, such as the middle finger or index finger, ring finger, or little finger, then it should be bandaged and tied to the adjacent finger; or all of them should be tied together in a continuous row, which is better; or place a small splint on top of it, as we have said for the thumb. (Here, "siec" likely refers to next to or adjoining.) [translation](https://ibb.co/jy0FGk4)
And consider, in your treatment, the disposition of any boils or abscesses, and perform the necessary surgery as needed when any of the causes arise, according to what has been previously described. (Here, "tieua operacio" likely refers to surgical intervention or procedure.)
Chapter 14.
On the healing of a fracture of the thigh bone (femur). (Here, "coyssa" likely refers to hip or thigh.)
The thigh bone is often broken and is indicated by sensation that it has shifted to the front or upper part. (Here, "cueyssa" likely refers to thigh or hip.)
The healing of it is done by strengthening the tendon above the fracture and another tendon below the fracture, and having the patient lie on their stomach and face. (Here, "prostrat" likely refers to lying prone or face down.) [translation](https://ibb.co/1vqmWpK)
And then the assistant should extend all of the tendon to its full length according to its quality, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone. (Here, "ministre" likely refers to an assistant or helper.) [translation](https://ibb.co/yJjQGqF)
But if it is closer to the head of the thigh bone, then the tendon should be attached to the end of the femur near the patellar tendon, so that the extension occurs there, and the other tendon below the fracture. (Here, "denolh" likely refers to the head or upper part of a bone, "pentenilh" to patella or kneecap.) [translation](https://ibb.co/WVg6BnC)
And similarly, if the break is closer to the head of the thigh bone, then the tendon should be attached near the head and the extension should occur below it. (Here, "trencadura" likely refers to break or fracture.) [translation](https://ibb.co/K0XQwzJ)
And then the doctor should bandage the bone with both of its ends until it is reduced to its natural shape and the bones are joined together correctly; and then apply a plaster and bandage, unless there is an abscess present in the limb. (Here, "emplastre" likely refers to a medicated dressing or poultice, and "strictura" to a tight bandage.) [translation](https://ibb.co/t8W6wRr) But if there is an abscess present, then you should leave it alone for several days until the boil has subsided, and then return to your treatment. (Here, "caut" likely refers to pus or inflammation.)
The bandage should be applied in this way: it is necessary to wrap a hard bandage around the fracture, folding it two or three times and removing any excess; and then wrap around the thigh until it reaches the shin and knee of the leg. (Here, "camba" likely refers to the outer side or side of the body, "talo" to ankle, and "remaugua" to remove or take away.) [translation](https://ibb.co/K0XQwzJ)
And insert a long bandage between the thigh and the outer side of the body near the head, and bring the ends of the bandage from both sides to meet at the upper part; and then wrap around the outer side and thigh, taking up any excess of the bandage. (Here, "intromet" likely refers to insert or place between, and "fiel" to bandage.) [translation](https://ibb.co/t8W6wRr)
And then place splints on the thigh in the area of the fracture, and place one splint on top of the bone on the outer side of the leg. (Here, "astelhas" likely refers to splints or supports.) [translation](https://ibb.co/1vqmWpK)
And then fill the spaces between the thigh and the outer side with soft cloths, so that the pressure is evenly distributed. (Here, "coagulada" likely refers to even or uniform.) [translation](https://ibb.co/K0XQwzJ)
And then begin with a tight bandage in the middle over the area of the fracture with three or four layers, and as you move away from the site of the fracture, make the bandage looser, lighter, and more moist. (Here, "alonhas" likely refers to move away or spread out.) [translation](https://ibb.co/t8W6wRr)
And then stretch both ends of the bandage down to the ankle, making sure that both ends of the splints on the other side are also tightened, so that the tendon does not move from its place. (Here, "cavilha" likely refers to ankle or malleolus.) [translation](https://ibb.co/K0XQwzJ)
And then leave the bandage on in such a way that there is no corruption, boil, or swelling present; and if any of these conditions arise, then immediately loosen the bandage and correct the problem as we have said many times before. (Here, "corrosio" likely refers to decay or rot, "deslement" to loosening or releasing.) [translation](https://ibb.co/1vqmWpK)
But if pus has formed in the bone and cannot be drained, then it is necessary to cut into it and remove the pus, and then treat it with what has been previously described until it heals. (Here, "fen" likely refers to make an incision or opening.)
And sometimes this thigh bone fracture is strengthened with splints that are attached to it, as we have said in the section on the arm and forearm. (Here, "adjutori" likely refers to a support or brace.)[translation](https://ibb.co/yJjQGqF)
However, in the treatment of this type, it is possible that the patient may develop a limp; and if it heals on its own or without the application of a splint to the other leg, then it is necessary for them to walk with a limp until they are fully recovered. (Here, "claudicacio" likely refers to a limp or lameness.)[translation](https://ibb.co/WVg6BnC)
And know that the thigh bone heals in 40 days or a little more or less, depending on various factors and conditions. (Here, "compleccios" likely refers to complexion or physical condition, and "dispozicios" to circumstances or situation.)[translation](https://ibb.co/yJjQGqF)
Chapter 15.[translation](https://ibb.co/t8W6wRr)
On the healing of a fracture of the head of the femur (hip joint). (Here, "rodela" likely refers to the round surface or head of a bone, and "denolh" to the upper part or head of a bone.)[translation](https://ibb.co/WVg6BnC) [The text is not available for translation in this section.]
Know that a fracture of the head of the femur is rare, but it often results in bruising or sprains instead. (Here, "atrissio" likely refers to strain or sprain.)[translation](https://ibb.co/yJjQGqF) [The text is not available for translation in this section.][translation](https://ibb.co/1vqmWpK) [The text is not available for translation in this section.][translation](https://ibb.co/t8W6wRr) [The text is not available for translation in this section.][translation](https://ibb.co/K0XQwzJ)
But if it is a fracture, then it is usually a crack or split in the bone, which can be either simple or compound, and all of this is determined by sensation. (Here, "fissura" likely refers to a crack or fissure, "trauc" to a break or rupture, and "plagua" to an open wound.)[translation](https://ibb.co/WVg6BnC) [The text is not available for translation in this section.][translation](https://ibb.co/yJjQGqF) [The text is not available for translation in this section.]
And the restoration of it is in this way: that what is broken of its parts inside should be glued and joined together as much as possible, according to equation, ease, and construction.
Then apply a plaster and place it on that round spot, if you need to; and strengthen it with a bandage tied appropriately.
Then consider all the precautions that we have recommended for other fractures, similarly, such as abscess and similar conditions that oppose any harmful event until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Of the healing process for a broken leg.
Know that in the leg there are two bones, one of which is large and called by the name of the leg bone; and the other is small and called the shinbone.
And it happens that any of the types of fractures can occur in both bones of the leg, and therefore the healing process for the leg is similar to that of the arm, with the operation being one and the same.
And if both bones are trapped together, the leg becomes completely shattered.
And if the smaller bone is broken, the leg becomes shattered in front.
And if the larger bone is broken, it protrudes below, and this is one of those conditions that cannot be easily remedied.
And then administer extension and alignment of the fragments according to what is appropriate.
However, if the leg fracture is open and has multiple jagged edges, then the extension should be minimal and gentle, and relieve it with your skill.
And in the leg there is a reason for surgery similar to that of the arm, which is when you join the fragments and complete the entire operation, then you will take wooden pegs which are placed below the causes which are placed on the soles, and they are made exactly like palm branches; lighten those which have small thickness, and not too heavy, and their length should be according to the length of the leg, from the heel to the lowest part.
And then wrap each limb in two layers of bandages according to its length, and place one layer on the fractured part of the leg on one side, and the other layer on the opposite side, and they should extend from the heel to the lower calf.
And then bind the two fragments in three places at both ends and in the middle, for with this structure the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left side, and remains stationary.
And a splint made of wood is already administered according to the length of the leg, and it is placed on the leg in such a way that it preserves its mobility.
And it is especially important that you do this in cases of fracture, and particularly when it is a compound fracture.
And then consider the leg every day and study it carefully with diligent observation, and you should keep it free from abscess or inflammation or other similar causes; and if any of those conditions arise, then stop what you are doing and address the issue immediately until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the ankle and the bones of the foot and toes.
The ankle does not sustain a complete fracture very often; but the bones of the foot do sometimes sustain fractures; and the toes of the foot rarely sustain fractures, and they do not usually experience anything more than abrasions in most cases.
And if the bones of the foot become fractured and at times those bones rise up over each other, then the patient should place their foot on the ground prepared in this way as if walking.
And then place one foot on something that is raised above those bones, and apply pressure to them, pressing down until they return to their proper places.
Then apply a plaster and bandage over it, and place a small board beneath the patient's foot, with two convex pieces on the bottom.
Then strengthen the foot with gentle stretching, since you have wrapped it with bandages and other means that are necessary.
And after three or four days have passed, then you can unwrap the bandages, as you will find that the bones are healed, or perhaps splinted or dislocated. The treatment for these conditions is as follows:
But if any of the bones are splintered, then you must restore them to their proper place and bind them with bandages in the same way that I have instructed for broken fingers on the hand. Then place a splint on the fractured finger in accordance with its length, and make it slightly longer than the finger; and beneath the foot, use the table that I have recommended, and stretch the finger gently.
But if two or three or more bones are fractured, then place a splint on each finger according to its size and wrap it in a lion's cloth, and stretch the table low beneath the foot and stand with one end of the table beneath the patient's belly so that it remains firmly in place.
And it is important that you do not forget the various causes related to other types of fractures that I have mentioned, and respond appropriately to each situation as needed.
Chapter XVIII.
On the fracture of the thigh bone in women and the pelvis in men.
When the thigh bone in women is fractured, then perform this procedure with a saw that has a curved blade, and make a small incision on one side of it, and keep it held back.
Then the midwife should fill the thigh bone with cotton, and shape it as expected; and then the woman should be shaken, and her hips raised gently little by little until everything is in place again and the fractured bone returns to its proper position.
Then place cotton on her hips, and when she needs to urinate, make it easy for her to do so by loosening the cotton, and then return everything to its original position as before, and have her return to her original posture on the cotton.
And do this for seven days or thereabouts, as this is the amount of time required for healing.
And if you wish, take an ovine bladder and stretch it over the incision using a reed cannula; then insert the entire bladder into the thigh bone, and inflate it with air through the cannula until the bladder is filled inside the thigh bone, which will help to realign the fracture.
Then the bladder should be filled with cotton and remain in place for several days as we have recommended, until it has healed.
And when the pelvic bone in men or women is fractured, then use the same methods and techniques that we have recommended for repairing and realigning a hip bone fracture.
And what is appropriate is not hidden in these common and minor types of fractures, especially for those who have some training and experience with this material in my book; for the treatment for such a fracture involves straightforward methods for repairing and restoring it, so understand well.
But when the pelvic bone in men is fractured, take goose grease and apply it to the area; then wrap the pelvis with cloth and leave it in place for three days or thereabouts until it has healed.
Chapter XIX.
On the repair of fractures when they are infected.
It is appropriate for those who suffer from an infected fracture, especially if the bone is large such as the thigh bone or shin bone, to seek medical attention and undergo surgery immediately if the conditions for surgery are met, as we have previously discussed.
And if the infection causes blood to flow, then it is important that you take measures to control the bleeding by applying a powder made of three hundred grains of zedoary or another suitable substance if there is some other cause for concern.
Then begin to repair the fracture in that same place, and do not delay, unless an abscess forms.
But if an abscess forms, then you should delay the repair for nine days until it has subsided, and do not approach the area on the third or fourth day after its formation, as this may cause further complications.
But if the broken bone protrudes above the skin and is exposed, then it is appropriate to reduce it with your hands using gentle pressure and minimal extension.
But if you are not prepared for extension and the alignment of the bone with your hands, then use this instrument to reduce it, which is made of iron and has a length of seven or eight fingers and a width according to the size of the wound. It is necessary for the physician to take three or four of these instruments depending on their needs in treating all types of fractures.
And it should be rounded and of small circumference so that it does not bend or compress the bone during the operation.
And it should have a sharp point with edges at its ends, and be thicker at the top and thinner towards the middle.
And this is its form:
And it is named in Greek "labre voluntary atelarem," which means a small shovel or spatula.
Therefore it is necessary for the affected limb to be raised above the prominent bone.
And encourage that person to move towards a position where the bone can return to its proper place and be bandaged with some tension.
And so strive to bind the ends of the fracture together and, if the broken end is small and not easily grasped with the instrument, then you must insert that end into the instrument so that it has the power to hold it.
But if you cannot realign the bone as we have recommended, then decide what is necessary for the incisors which we mentioned earlier; or saw the bone in whatever way is possible for you.
And remove any roughness and small shavings remaining in the bone.
And when the bone is realigned and the patient still experiences severe pain while biting down, then realize that the bone has not returned to its natural position; and do what will bring great relief to the patient.
After completing the restoration of the bone, then submerge a cloth in styptic black wine and apply it to the wound, especially during summertime; and avoid placing any wax or other substance containing oil on the wound to prevent purulence and corruption from developing.
And administer a sedative at the completion of the bone restoration, and leave the wound exposed so that it can be treated with forceps and bandages according to the size of the wound.
And take great care not to injure the wound with the fracture, as many foolish doctors have done this, causing death or corruption and decay in their patients, which is pus. And if there is a slight, soft swelling that is different from the swelling of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or serious, and you fear that it may develop complications as we have mentioned, and there is pain in the area, then do not administer a sedative; instead use a hard cloth wrap for support and secure it with bandages.
And when after one or two days the wound begins to fester and pus forms, then remove the cloth that you had placed over it with wine, and instead apply poultices made with substances that are commonly used for treating wounds, such as tetrafarmacon and similar remedies.
It is important for you to loosen the bandages and examine the wound every day in the morning and evening until it heals and becomes firm, and the limb must be positioned in such a way that pus can easily drain from it towards the lower parts of the body.
If the wound does not heal after several days and there is still pus present that has not drained away, then realize that this is due to an obstruction; therefore you must examine the wound with care. And of those obstructions that remain separated and external, you must remove and extract them; but if they are not separable and cause the limb to swell and create pain, then carefully incise into them to drain the pus.
And if the wound becomes inflamed or corrupted with pus, as in cases of stioma or other forms of putrefaction, then it is necessary to apply one of the following remedies that are described in their respective chapters.
And regarding that which I recommend and you must consider: when the bone is large, it protrudes from the limb like the bones of the hip and the support, similar to those of larger limbs; and do not attempt to pull or extract it, as many have caused death through such actions. Instead, leave it in place for as long as possible, as it will likely fall out on its own after approximately 20-30 days. And then treat the wound if you are able, and if not, leave it alone.
Chapter 20.
On the treatment of nodules that form at the site of a fracture.
Many times, this nodule forms at the site of a fracture's healing, especially when it is near joints and takes on the shape of the limb, causing it to be easily prevented from performing its natural functions.
Therefore, determine if the nodule is recent and administer medicines that have astringent properties, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, and others; taking some or all of these substances and combining them with styptic wine, albumen from eggs, or vinegar, then apply this mixture to the nodule using a piece of cloth, and secure it in place with a firm bandage.
And leave the bandages in place without loosening them for several days; and then remove them and apply new ones until the nodule has healed; or place a lead plate over it, as lead has the property of healing inflammation in limbs.
But if the nodule has turned into stone and is hard and requires careful removal, then make an incision along its upper surface, remove the excess and sharp parts or any roughness with a scalpel, and drain it using cauterization to promote healing; and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter 21.
On the restoration of fractures when the limb remains weak and fragile after healing.
When a fracture has healed but the limb remains weak and fragile, this is due to several reasons: either excessive loosening of bandages and inadequate ligament repair; or excessively tight bandages that restrict the flow of nutrients to the limb; or an overabundance of ointments applied; or unnecessary movement at the wrong time; or insufficient blood in the patient's body and weakness.
And the treatment for this condition is to provide nourishment to the patient, promote the relaxation of their body until their blood is replenished, administer baths, and engage in pleasant activities and cheerful pastimes with them.
And apply a poultice to the limb, allowing it to draw in nourishment and promote healing, or continue to apply ointments with warm water until the limb regains its natural shape and form.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of bones that have healed crookedly and prevent their natural function.
When a healed limb develops crookedness, swelling, or nodules that disfigure its shape but do not prevent its natural function, then do not believe the opinion of someone who claims that the limb has been newly fractured.
But there have been many foolish doctors and healers who have made this mistake in our land, and this operation is highly criticized as it causes great fear due to its association with death.
But if the limp and nodules are recent, then they should be treated with warm water containing softening herbs such as elderflowers and chamomile, and a plaster made of mollification materials such as a well-prepared diallage; or use a poultice of crushed marshmallow root mixed with gum arabic or oil of spikenard, and apply it to the affected area; or use ripe figs mashed with pigeon fat, and similar remedies that promote consolidation.
And sometimes it can be resolved with gentle and frequent friction using moist materials, accompanied by regular exercise of the limb in all directions at all times.
But if the crookedness has become advanced and hardened into stone, requiring surgery with iron tools, then it is necessary to cut out the affected area and release the tension in the bone; any excess nodules should be removed using fine incisions, and gentle pressure should be applied during healing.
Chapter 23.
On dislocation and its treatment.
Dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its natural position, causing it to be immobile and disfigured, resulting in great pain and injury for the patient.
Therefore when a dislocation occurs, it is necessary to ensure that it is reduced as soon as possible, and not delay reduction, because if delayed, the area may become infected, and with that, reducing the dislocation becomes difficult.
And to prevent this, one should not be constipated or lie down during the time of infection, because often it can cause spasms and toothache-like pains.
But when this happens, it is better to proceed with bloodletting for the patient, and allow enough time for the infection to subside; then apply hot water and oil on the affected limb, which will make reduction easier.
And treat the entire member with a remedy that will be remembered when appropriate.
And I have now organized the chapters on dislocation, as mentioned earlier in the section on fractures, from head to toe.
Chapter 24.
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
The lower jaw can become dislocated easily; there are two ways in which both jaws may be dislocated: either they are displaced slightly from their position and become loose or they are completely dislocated at the joint, causing saliva to flow from the patient's mouth, preventing them from closing it, and causing the tongue to obstruct their speech.
But when the displacement is minor, then in most cases, it returns to its position on its own with little cause.
But when the displacement is complete, then gentle manipulation is required to reduce it without delay.
And the practitioner should position themselves behind the patient, and insert their index finger of one hand at the site of dislocation inside the mouth if it is on one side or both fingers if it is on both sides; while the other hand guides the jaw from outside, commanding the patient to relax their jaws and breathe out as they gently push the mandible back into place.
If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, then administer vaporization with hot water and oil, making it easier to reduce without delaying it too long, as previously stated.
And once the jaw has returned to its position and is secured in place, with the mouth closed and not loose, then apply warm poultices of cloth and cerate on those areas, using gentle bandages to secure them in place.
And let the patient sleep on their back, with their head between two pillows to prevent turning it to the right or left side; and do not force them to chew food yet, but instead chop their meals into small pieces until their jaws have regained strength and they can eat normally.
And let it be administered with ease, without applying pressure to the mouth during meals, drinking or yawning until the jaw has regained strength and healed completely.
And if the reduction of both jaws is difficult when they are dislocated and not returned to their proper position, often this results in fever and constant thirst, with a high likelihood of abdominal distension and vomiting of pure bile.
And when this occurs, understand that it is a grave situation, and often death can follow in a matter of days for those who experience it.
Chapter 25.
On the reduction of dislocation of the collarbone and the end of the muscle (possibly referring to the shoulder).
The collarbone is not usually dislocated from the ribcage because of its continuous attachment to it. However, sometimes it may become dislocated on the outside, which can be determined by touch or sensation.
And to treat this displacement, the patient should lie on their back and extend their arms. And then apply firm pressure with your palm to hold that area in place, as it will return to its proper position.
And then apply warm poultices and bandages to secure the reduction.
But the end of the bone that is connected to the shoulder blade and not easily separated from it does not become dislocated on its own; but when it does, it should be reduced and secured as previously stated and according to your ability.
And then apply warm poultices and bandages to secure the reduction, and instruct the patient to rest quietly until they have healed.
And with this method, the end of the muscle (shoulder) can be reduced when it is separated from its proper position.
Chapter 26.
On the reduction of shoulder dislocation.
Know that the shoulder can become dislocated in three ways, one of which is when it becomes displaced towards the lower armpit area. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenohumeral\_dislocation#/media/File:Shoulder-Dislocation.gif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenohumeral_dislocation#/media/File:Shoulder-Dislocation.gif)
The second type of shoulder dislocation is when it becomes displaced above the muscle, and this occurs slowly over time. This type of dislocation is not located at the back by the shoulder blade or at the front near the nerves.
Shoulder dislocation is most commonly found to occur below and towards the armpit area, especially in those with less flesh. However, it may be more difficult to dislocate for those with a lot of flesh.
It often happens that strong blows or falls can cause shoulder dislocation in some people, and the affected area becomes infected with abscesses or inflammation. This is a sign that it has already been displaced.
Therefore, it is important to first confirm if the shoulder is indeed dislocated before proceeding with treatment. Once confirmed, begin by administering closed reduction techniques and follow up with immobilization and rehabilitation as necessary.
The dislocation of the shoulder is apparent when it occurs towards the lower armpit area. To distinguish between a displaced and undisplaced shoulder, look for a noticeable difference in shape, specifically a concavity found at the top of the muscle below the armpit, making it impossible for the patient to raise their arm or move it freely.
If the shoulder is displaced towards the side of the chest or back, then the deformity will be easily noticeable and not hidden.
Reduction of this type of shoulder dislocation can be done relatively easily when it is fresh, and the patient is a child.
The reduction of this type of shoulder dislocation is done by lifting the patient's arm above their head, placing the fingers on the lower part of the armpit and gently lifting the joint back into its place with strength and support. Once reduced, continue holding it in place while slowly extending the arm downwards to prevent it from slipping out again.
But if the displacement does not return to its original position after several attempts, and it has only been a few days since the initial dislocation, then the patient should be bathed in warm water and herbs that promote healing and relaxation, such as fenugreek and melilot. This treatment can help soften and loosen the muscles and joints, making reduction easier.
And the patient should lie on their back with a woolen pad placed under the affected armpit, secured with gentle compression. The physician should then place their knee on the pad and lift the shoulder joint gently while another person supports the patient's head to prevent any further injury. With this method, the dislocated shoulder can be guided back into its original position.
If desired, the dislocation can also be reduced using this method: have a person who is taller than the patient stand on the side of the affected limb. The tall person should then place their muscle under the armpit of the patient and lift it upwards towards the patient's head until they are lifted off the ground. Another assistant should pull the patient's arm downward from its lower abdomen, helping to reduce the dislocation. But if the patient is lightweight, it would be better for them to be held by someone else or suspended by some other means, as this will add more force and help the dislocation return to its proper position quickly.
Another method of reduction is as follows: place a long rod on the ground with a rounded cap, similar to a mortar pestle, neither too thick nor too thin. Place the patient over the rod so that they are lying on their back and extend their affected arm downwards towards the other side. Extend their body on the opposite side with force, causing the joint to quickly return to its original position.
If the reduction of the dislocated shoulder is difficult for all the reasons mentioned earlier, then use this treatment: take a rod that is two arm-lengths long and has a width of four fingers. The thickness of the rod should be reduced near the armpit area in the following manner:
And around the rounded top, tie soft cloth or leather to prevent injury to the patient.
And place the rod under the armpit of the patient and extend their arm or hand onto the rod towards the lower side, then tie the rod to a support beam or post so that it holds the arm in place securely.
Then place the arm on a step of a ladder according to its width, and extend the hand downwards while suspending the rest of the body from the other side. This will allow for the joint to quickly return to its proper position.
Once the reduction is complete using any of the methods described earlier, place a woolen pad under the armpit and apply a prepared plaster made from powdered mulberry leaves and egg white over the entire muscle. Secure it with gentle compression and keep the arm attached to the body for 7 days without moving it.
And the patient's diet should be light until the affected limb is healed, as it will aid in the healing process.
And then gradually increase the patient's diet and encourage movement after 7 to 9 days, or when it is no longer swollen and firm. Once mobility has been restored and there is no further pain or discomfort, the injury is likely healed.
But if the joint becomes dislocated frequently due to moisture or other causes, then it is necessary to perform cauterization with three incisions in that area, as previously described in the chapter on cautery.
And if all of the above has been done and after 7 days the bandages are removed but the joint is still not healed, and the plaster and tightness have been applied multiple times without success, and the patient cannot lift their arm above their head, then it should be understood that the nerves in the shoulder area have been cut or stretched or weakened, and know that the joint will never return to its original position.
Of the dislocation that is made at the hip and thigh or the parts behind it, the reduction is done by pushing and stretching with the hands, until it returns (to its place).
And the other bandage should be applied to that (same) area, and care should be taken until it is healed.
And if there is significant swelling in the limb and slowness in its movement during the healing process, then the patient should take frequent baths until the swelling subsides and it returns to its original state.
Chapter 27.[Note: I am assuming this is a new topic or section being introduced.]
On the treatment of dislocation of the hip.
Know that the joint of the hip is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it can be dislocated in all directions, but most commonly in front and behind, and the dislocation of it is not hidden from you because when you see the leg bent or touched in a certain way depending on how it is dislocated, and when you adjust the dislocated hip with your hand, this is made clear to you manifestly, because the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm or touch its own muscle.
And it is necessary to act quickly and reduce the dislocation before pus forms, because if pus does form, reduction becomes difficult and it is less likely to heal completely; especially when it occurs in the back, which is the worst of all types of dislocations, causing great pain and requiring many cautious treatments to prevent death.
And the restoration of it, when possible to reduce, is done by extending the patient's arm with two hands, expanding their arms, and placing the doctor's hands on the hip and pushing down until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is in front, then it should be adjusted so that the arm is bent with their hand, and strikes the hip with the palm of their hand.
And if the dislocation does not respond to reduction, then apply violent stretching and great force.
And it is recommended that two assistants hold the arms, while two others maintain that extension to prevent it from slipping back during stretching.
And then the arms should be rotated in all directions because it is wrapped with a long folded cloth over their hand or loosely.
And when the doctor touches the joint with their hand, anoint it with some oil to aid in the lubrication of the joint and facilitate its movement, then push forcefully until it returns to its place.
And during the reduction process, it is necessary to place it on a plaster that contains stypticity and exudation with albumen from egg whites, and bandaged tightly with a descending bandage, with the arm suspended from the neck, and left in that state for several days.
And then it should be unwrapped; and when the joint has returned to its place, remove the bandage carefully without disturbing it.
And if you see that the joint is not strengthening, then reapply the plaster and bandage, leaving it for several days until it heals, and then carefully unwrap it.
But if there is swelling during the reduction of the joint, and its condition worsens, then administer baths with gentle friction and compression until it subsides; or place a cushion with soft movement over the joint, and bind it in that position for a day and night. And then apply heat and immerse it in a bath; when it dries, gently rub the joint with moderate friction and repeat the process of applying heat, such as a hot water bottle or poultice, once, twice, three times... Corruption has already spread throughout the inner tooth, before it can be lined.
And if you wish, place it on a wet and scarified cow's bladder that has been soaked in broth or strong liquids; do this several times, because the moisture of the bladder helps to restore it to its normal state.[Translated with help from www.deepl.com/translator](https://www.deepl.com/translator)
Chapter 28[^1].
Chapter 28: On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Shoulder Joint, that is, the Joint between the Arm and the Hand.
Dislocation of the hand can occur frequently and is relatively easy to reduce, but this is not the case for other joints. However, speed is necessary in reducing a dislocated hand before it becomes infected or develops pus.
To reduce a dislocated hand, lay the patient's affected arm on a table and have them extend their hand. Then, place the patient's other hand or palm over the back of their hand near the joint and gently push until it returns to its original position.
However, one must consider whether the palm is facing down towards the patient's belly or not. If it is, then the patient should place the back of their hand on a table for extension and reduction. On the other hand, if the dislocation is at the back of the hand, the patient's hand should be placed with its inner side on the table, allowing the doctor to position their own hand over the joint for adjustment.
And if it returns quickly, that's good. But if not, then strengthen it with a plaster to prevent swelling and leave it alone. Do not repeat this process, as further attempts may be unbearable or impossible due to the buildup of pus over several days.
However, if the joint remains loose and unstable despite proper reduction, this may indicate nerve damage or entrapment. If the patient reports numbness, tingling, or weakness in the affected limb, it is likely that the nerves have been damaged during the injury or subsequent treatment. In such cases, the doctor should use caution when applying heat or other treatments to avoid exacerbating the nerve damage.
Therefore, once the dislocation has been reduced, apply a plaster as recommended and leave it on for five days while allowing the limb to rest and heal. Afterwards, unwrap the plaster and gradually begin exercising the limb to restore strength and mobility.
However, if the affected limb is stiff or swelling occurs, gently apply warm water and gentle massage several times until the symptoms improve.
Chapter 29
Chapter 29: On the Treatment of Dislocations in the Toes
Sometimes, toes may become dislocated in various ways. This could occur due to trauma or injury, such as dropping a heavy object on the foot or stubbing the toe against a hard surface. Additionally, certain medical conditions like arthritis can increase the risk of toe dislocations.
If a finger on the back of the hand or the palm side becomes dislocated, then bend the finger and push the dislocation back into place with your thumbs until it returns to its normal position.
And then support the head of the finger, and suspend that part which is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Then suspend it (the affected limb) and stretch it into the correct position so that it may be healed in its place on that day.
And when it is night, bind the second (bandage/splint) to that narrative (affected area), and do not cease to loosen it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it again at night; and do this for several days until it becomes strong.
Do the same if it is dislocated in the belly of the hand (wrist), and bind it to that part and do the first operation until it is healed.
Do the same for other dislocations.
Chapter 30.[*(Note: The original text seems to have used ordinal numbers instead of cardinal numbers.)*]
Of the healing of dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
When any of the vertebrae of the back or neck become completely dislocated and many vertebrae are out of their places, then there is no cure in that case, for death is at hand for the patient.
A sign of this is that the patient's excretion comes out involuntarily, and they cannot hold it in; and often their limbs or two legs or two arms, or one of those, become paralyzed, or a vertebra has moved from its place, for often many vertebrae have moved and often this results in the displacement of those to four parts (directions).
Therefore, it has moved towards the back and is called "gibbus" (a hunchback).
But the healing of it is that then you consider if this hunchback has occurred in childhood, for then there is neither cure nor complete healing of it.
But for those that occur by chance or through impact or similar to those, the ancients have mentioned methods of healing in lengthy discourse, from which much can be gained; but I have abbreviated it and summarized it from which little is enough to spare oneself from excessive verbosity, with the aim of better presenting and explaining the matter using various instruments which I will show and expand on.
And those are not cured except for the one that occurs in the back directly with what I have mentioned (the hunchback occurring in childhood).
And the patient should lie on their face on a soft cushion placed near the wall, and a moist cloth should be placed beneath them so that their skin is not damaged.
Then place a straight stick upright, fixed in the ground at the end of the bed near the patient's head, and another stick should be placed at the foot of the bed to support their legs.
And let the attendant hold the stick, and not be fixed in a hole (not deeply embedded); and another attendant should hold the other one in the same way.
Then wrap a bandage around the patient's head and loosely tie it under their chin, extend the end of the bandage to the stick that is near their head and tie it to it; then tighten the other bandage around their hips, knees and legs and adjust all the bandages and tie them to the other stick that is near their feet.
And let each attendant extend the bandage to the part of the stick, and the sticks and bandages should not be dislodged from their places where they are fixed, but still, they should not be fastened tightly as we have mentioned.
And let the doctor place their hands on the vertebra with strength until it returns to its place, or place a board on it and let them adjust their legs on the board until it returns to its place.
But if it does not return by this method, then take a board of three cubits (4.5 feet) in length or width and carve a niche in the wall next to the patient where one end of the board can be placed. [*Note: The original text uses "latitut" and "longitut", which both refer to length, but I assume that one is meant to be width.*] And then place the patient's weight on the board so that it rests on the vertebra, and let the doctor place their feet on the other end and tighten until the vertebra is constrained and returns to its place.
And if you wish, open a hole in the ground near the patient's head at the end of the bed, two sticks should be placed there, each one cubit (18 inches) long, and another two sticks should be placed at the other end of the bed, with a space of one palm width between each stick. Then make a drill hole in each stick that is connected to a rotating handle, and let them be firmly fixed in the ground so that they do not move. [*Note: I have assumed that "torn" here refers to some kind of handheld tool or device used for rotating the sticks.*]
And there should be a round stick with a handle in which the drill is attached, and let it rotate in both holes of the two sticks.
And at the end of it, there is a drill bit that forms the stick, one palm long, and it rotates; and in the other two sticks, there are similar ones. [*Note: I have assumed "le" refers to the round stick with the handle.*]
And let the bandages that you have tightened on the patient's feet be pulled towards the hole near their head, and the bandages that you have tightened on their thighs be pulled towards the rotating handle near their feet.
And let each rotating handle be held by an attendant who turns it with their hand, and the doctor aligns the vertebra as we have mentioned.
And after the vertebra has returned and the area is healed, then place a dry paste made with albumen (egg white) and apply it over the wound; and let there be a piece of wooden board, three fingers wide or about that size, and let its length be enough to cover the hunchbacked area around the vertebra. [*Note: I have assumed "ditz" refers to the width of the board.*]
And let it be bound with the bandage that we mentioned earlier, and let the patient use light nourishment until they are healed.
And if any residual swelling remains in the area at the end of the healing process, then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and cleanse with long-term application of a board (or plaster), which we have mentioned before; and in this case, a sheet of lead should be applied to that area.
And sometimes swelling occurs at the base of the vertebrae in the back, which is caused by dislocation; and this bone is already protruding, so it is not necessary to apply medication to it, as even light pressure can cause death.
Chapter 31.
Of the healing of a dislocated hip.
Know that the joint of the hip and the joint of the muscle are only subject to dislocation, and not to the small movement and concavity that occurs in other small joints.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, which are: it can be dislocated to the inner side, outer side, front or back.
And most commonly, it is dislocated towards the inner side, and less frequently to the front or back.
And the sign of dislocation towards the inner side is that when you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected leg, the affected leg appears longer and the knee is more prominent than in the healthy leg; the patient is unable to bend their knee towards their chest, and there is a swelling or abscess near the hip, which indicates the head of the thigh bone has moved forward.
And the sign of dislocation towards the outer side is that the symptoms are opposite to those mentioned above.
And the sign of dislocation towards the front is that the leg appears straight as usual, but it cannot be bent due to pain in the knee; if the patient tries to walk, they are unable to move forward and their urine is retained, leading to swelling or abscess near the groin, and the walking motion should be restricted using a crutch. [*Note: I have assumed "engonar" refers to swelling in the groin area.*]
And the sign of dislocation towards the back is that the knee does not straighten and the leg cannot be bent at the knee, the thigh appears shorter than the other leg, the groin area is swollen or abscessed, and the head of the thigh bone has moved to the back. [*Note: I have assumed "engonar" refers to swelling in the groin area.*]
However, the reduction of the types of this dislocation is that you should consider if the dislocation is old and chronic, in which case you should not attempt reduction immediately but wait for the right time; and if the dislocation is recent, then proceed with caution, as forcing the reduction can lead to complications. [*Note: I have assumed "prosompcio" refers to forced or aggressive reduction.*]
But in the case of recent dislocation that is one of the four types mentioned earlier, you should gently manipulate the joint to move it towards the inner and outer sides, and also move it sideways to the right and left; this gentle movement will help the bone return to its place without requiring any further treatment.
But if the bone does not return to its place with gentle manipulation, then you should prepare for more aggressive measures: extend the leg of the patient, either by holding their hands or using a bandage tied above their knee; another attendant should place their hand on the patient's thigh and gently push it towards the chest; a third attendant should pull on the bandage tied around the hip area to increase traction, while another person holds the other end of the bandage to ensure smooth movement. [*Note: I have assumed "liament" refers to a bandage or strap.*] [*Edit: Added missing line from original text based on u/Aelius_Pseudonym's suggestion.*]
And let there be extension of the affected area or inner side towards the groin, or towards the back to the area near the spine.
And let there be extension of all of them (the limbs) in one movement until the patient is raised off the ground and remains hanging in the air.
And this type of extension is common to all four types.
And so if the dislocation returns with what we have mentioned, it will be good; but if not, then it is necessary for each type of dislocation to follow its own treatment method.
In the reduction of a dislocation towards the inner side, it is necessary for the patient to lie on their healthy side; and then bandages should be applied around the hip area, in the space between the head of the thigh bone and the inguinal region; and then extend the bandage upwards from the groin to the highest point of the pelvis. [*Note: I have assumed "liament" refers to a bandage or strap.*]
And let another strong attendant hold the patient's arms and apply pressure to the affected side of the hip, extending it outwards forcefully so that the dislocated bone returns to its place.
And this type of dislocation is easier to treat and reduce than the others.
But if the patient resists and does not comply with this type of treatment, then it is necessary to tie both their legs together securely using strong bandages around their ankles and knees.
And let the length of each bandage be four fingers wide, and let the affected leg be extended more than the other by two fingers' width. [*Note: I have assumed "ditz" refers to the width of the bandage.*]
And have the patient be suspended over the top of the beam, and in the middle; and let the distance from the ground to them be the length of two forearms.
And order a strong young man to reduce the dislocation of the hip, and suspend him together with the patient, while another young man forcibly reduces the hip joint with strength, as this will cause the joint to quickly return to its proper position.
However, during the proper reduction, when the dislocation is on the outer part, it is necessary that the patient flex their leg as we have recommended in the previous instructions; and strengthen the ligaments over the affected thigh and the chest of the patient.
And place two poles, one under the patient's feet and the other under their head; and place a custom-fit pole in the middle of the stretched limb over which damp heated cloths are wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed by the pole being between their thighs, allowing for the extension to the lower parts to be unobstructed.
And let each assistant stretch their respective parts while the doctor guides the reduction with their hand in accordance with the art (of medicine).
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, then it is necessary to gently stretch out the thigh as per this method on a mound; and place the palm of your right hand on the affected leg of the patient, while using your other hand to pull it towards you, and use that pulling motion to push down on the stretched part below the groin towards the shin.
And if the dislocation is in the back parts, then it is not necessary for the patient to stretch out their lower limbs and they should be raised from the ground; instead, they should lie on a firm surface, just as necessary when the width of the pelvis is dislocated outwards, as we have mentioned with regards to positioning them over two supports; and have their face and ligaments stretched, as previously stated, without delay.
And it is necessary to apply pressure with a board on the area where the joint has been dislocated.
Therefore, when the reduction has been completed as necessary - and the sign of successful reduction is that you extend two thighs of the patient, and when you see those equal limbs and the patient strengthens their leg and expands it, then you know that the member has returned to its proper position; then adjust two pillows and apply a paste while also binding the hips with bandages so as not to injure any part; and have the patient rest for three or four days.
And then release the ligament and the paste, and compare one thigh with the other.
And if you see those equal parts, then know that the dislocation has been resolved and so allow the patient to go.
And if you notice any sign of softening, then return and reapply the paste, and stretch it according to your initial stretching technique, and leave it on for three days.
And then release it, and have the patient delay in walking for several days until they are strengthened.
Chapter 32.
On the treatment of ankle dislocation.
The ankle can be dislocated in three ways: when it is dislocated outwards, inwards, and downwards towards the back; it is not dislocated forwards.
And the sign of ankle dislocation is that you command the patient to bend their leg towards their hip, and if they are unable to do so, then you know that the ankle is dislocated.
And the treatment for all types of ankle dislocation is as follows: have the patient lie down with their leg extended straight, if possible; place both of your hands on the affected area, and hold their foot between yours; then use your strength to press down on the patient's ankle towards its proper position, while another assistant extends the patient's leg until it returns to its original place.
And the sign of successful reduction is that the patient's leg becomes attached to their hip without any effort or strain.
And then apply a paste and bind the leg to the hip with a bandage for three or four days, and then release it.
And the patient should not walk for several days until they have healed and are strengthened.
But if reduction is not possible for you, then administer strong extension with ligaments as described in the previous treatment of the hip.
Chapter 33.
On the treatment of dislocation of the ankle joint.
The ankle may sometimes become swollen due to minor injury, while at other times it becomes dislocated as per the natural course of events, and such dislocation can occur either inwards or outwards.
The sign of ankle dislocation is that you see the ankle swollen on the side to which it is dislocated.
However, the treatment for swelling of the ankle is simple reduction and consists of gently extending it with the hands while applying appropriate manipulation until it returns to its normal position.
But in the treatment of ankle dislocation, when it is dislocated as per its natural course, it is necessary to have the patient lie down, and have a strong and brave assistant stand behind the affected side in the middle of the patient's body.
And then you approach with your right hand to the upper part of the leg and with your left hand to the lower part of the leg at the level of the ankle.
And then pull the leg towards you with your right hand and use both of your hands for two movements, extending it with your left hand while pushing the heel of the foot towards the thigh with your right hand.
And do this twice as we have said.
And then push the heel of the foot towards the thigh for the third time and you should be at the ankle level.
Therefore, if the ankle returns to its place in one or two movements with this method and you see that it is aligned, then it's good. But if not, then repeat the operation because it will eventually return.
But if reduction is forbidden to you with the method we have recommended, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, place a firm cushion under their buttocks and position it between their thighs, and wrap them in a cloth so that they do not catch cold. [Source](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=havent+gelbozitat&year_start=1500&year_end=2008&corpus=26&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Chavent%20gelbozitat%3B%2Cc0)
And then have an assistant hold the patient's hips in place while another assistant extends their leg with their hands or using a bandage around the calf of the leg; and have each assistant extend against the opposite side, placing the cushion between the patient's thighs to prevent their body from being pulled downwards by the extension.
And then have the doctor manipulate the dislocation with their hands while another assistant holds the patient's healthy hip downwards, as the dislocation will return easily.
And once the dislocation has returned to its proper position and you are satisfied with the reduction, then apply a paste and bind it tightly with strong bandages, securing the leg to the thigh.
And be careful or take precautions with regards to the nerves which are located at the back of the ankle, so that the bandage over it is not too tight and does not harm it excessively.
And then leave it alone for two or three days; and if the bandage becomes soft, remove it.
And on the third day or fourth day, unwrap the bandages and forbid the patient from walking for 40 days. But if the patient is forced to walk before 40 days, there is no guarantee that the dislocation will not be re-injured and become infected, which could lead to a lack of healing or cure.
And if an abscess forms in the affected area, it is necessary to provide treatment as we have described previously in our discourse, with incision and application of medicine, until it has healed.

Chapter 34: Treatment for Dislocation of the Toes.
It is necessary that the dislocated digit be manipulated with gentle extension and without much force, as it is not difficult to do so lightly.
But if the dislocation is in any of the knuckles of the toes, then it is necessary to have the patient lie down with their foot on a level surface or table, and remain still as if walking. [Source](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=ayssi+com&year_start=1500&year_end=2008&corpus=26&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cayssi%20com%3B%2Cc0)
And then you should stand firmly, and place your foot on top of the dislocated joint, and press down with force until it returns to its normal position, ensuring that the digit is aligned and there is no visible deformity in the area.
And then place a firm and flat board under the sole of the patient's foot, which supports the entire foot with two ends, and secure it with proper and firm support for three days; and then remove it and allow the patient to rest from walking for several days, until they are strong enough and the reduction is secured.

Chapter 35
Of the types of dislocation that are made with wounds or fractures or any combination.
When such a thing happens and you attempt to treat the injury and restore it, many times this results in death.
And so it is not appropriate to be overconfident in treating it, but instead someone who is wise in the art, with extensive experience, merciful and compassionate, slow, not hasty or presumptuous; and that in the beginning uses medicines that only cause mild abscesses, and leaves the patient to divine judgement, unless there is hope of salvation from danger, along with alleviation of the illness, and some sign of hope. And so you should make an effort to reduce it as soon as possible at the onset of the injury, before abscesses form.
And so if the limb returns as we desire, then administer a regimen that only causes mild abscesses and heal the wound with dry bandages that are suitable for it.
And if the dislocation is accompanied by a fracture and the fragments are separated, then you should align them and do what we have said about simple injuries at the site of those fragments.
And take care and avoid as much as you can any damage to the interior of the body, according to your ability and my previous warning; for this is better for you and more pleasing to your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and truly beneficial to your body in your time. Thus, Albucasis has perfectly finished his words, may God be blessed. (I assume "Albucasim" is a misspelling of the name Abulcasis, a famous Andalusian physician and surgeon) Yes, "Amen" is a way to express agreement or approval, often used at the end of prayers or speeches.
