Oh, children of wisdom, I have come to you to complete this book, which is the last of the science of medicine, because of your faith in me, and for your experiences, and for your declarations, it is clear to me that you must understand this treatise, which is a part of my art, so to speak.
For our region and our time, surgery is a dangerous art, so that the science of it is in great danger; its vision is in its decline; and it does not remain among us except for a few small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which change the most and bring about those errors and ignorance that arise from the lack of understanding of its principles and the increase of its power and art.
I believe that I have composed this treatise in such a way as to order the sayings and the declarations and the abbreviations; and that it is for the purpose of adding to the forms of the instruments of cautery and other instruments of the work as well as for the addition of the declaration and the preparation of it, which is necessary
The reason why one does not find a good surgeon in our time is that the art of medicine is long, and that it includes many actors who must exercise their skill in the science of anatomy, which Gualia knows well, since she knows the structure of the limbs and their forms, and their union and separation; and she has knowledge of bones, nerves, and lacerations, and of their number, and of their color; and of the pulsating veins and the quietness of their place.
And thus says Hippocrates that he who has no name is not a man, and in small works and more in the art of the hand.
Indeed, as we said at the beginning of this book, he seen many of those who learn anatomy but do not learn it in the way that will save lives; for these are the ones who are formed in this science and depart from it by means of this science and by experiment
For I have seen a foolish doctor who, having incised an abscess of the scrotum in the groin of a woman, has incised several arteries of the groin so that a great amount of blood flows out, and the woman died between her legs.
And I have seen another doctor who took a stone from a man who had had it for a long time, and the stone was great, and when he brought it to me, I cut out that stone with a piece of the bladder, and on the third day the man died.
I have already told you that in such a case, when the stone is great and the patient’s condition is bad, we must know that he will die
I have seen another doctor who was taking care of a duke from our land for surgery, and he caused a black slave who was his servant to break his thigh in the patient’s groin; and in his ignorance the doctor, having fractured the bone, closed the wound with silk and thread of strong structure, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Then I dismissed them according to their desires, and I bound him, and I left him for five days and commanded that they remove the dressing; and thus the wound festered until the bone was completely exposed and the patient died.
I went back and found that they had taken off the dressing, and there was peace and the patient was relieved of his pain
However, corruption was already confirmed in the limb, for I could not restrain it, and I did not cease to spread corruption in the limb until the patient was in danger of death.
I have seen another doctor who performed an operation for cancer of the kidney, and caused ulcers nearby in a few days, so that the malice of the disease grew greater in the master of the house
The cause of this is that black bile is pure melancholy, which does not suffice to drive out the humour from the whole body, but that it should be applied to the limb which suffers so that the whole body becomes host to the rest
And thus, children, you must know that the art of surgery must be divided into two divisions: that which is associated with health, and that which is dangerous in the greatest conditions.
I have already spoken of this in many places in this book where I have discussed the error and fear of surgery; for you must know that it is necessary for you to preserve this and leave that, so that the fools do not find fault with you and you do not suffer for it
Therefore take the sacred arms in the request and in the protection of God, and the wicked diseases in the facility and in the firmness.
And thus, through the goodness of God, we have reached salvation and a blessed succession, and we have laid low the terrible diseases that are difficult to heal, and we have overcome the rest of the weapons of that which you fear, so that you may rejoice in your faith and in your name, for your merit rests with your glory, and more so in heaven and behind the rest of the saints.
Indeed, I have already mentioned several times: “There is no cure for a bad disease, so that no doctor shall be called by that name”.
And I have already had to deliver this book according to three chapters.
Begin the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter is arranged of the head inwards of the foot, in the forms of the instruments and in the instruments of the cautery, and of what is necessary in the operation
The division of the second part The second chapter, of swelling and perforation, and of blisters, and of wounds, and of the extraction of arrows and similar to these, all capitulated and arranged of the forms of the instruments
The third chapter, of restoration and dislocation, and of treatment of twist and similar to these; chapter arranged from the head inwards of the foot, and of the forms of the instruments
Since I have said what is the quality of the instruments of that cautery and of the documents of them, and in what combination it is prohibited to cauterize
Therefore I say that the word concerning the quality of the instruments of the cautery and of the document is a long and laborious one, and subtle for science, and a secret hidden; and already many savants have spoken of it, and they have disagreed with each other, and I am content with a small part of their sermons, fearing too much extension
Therefore I say that the cautery conforms to all the universal completion that is in matter or its matter, except for two completions, which are caudal completions of its matter
In the caudal and dry completion I matter disagree; for some say that the cautery is useful for that, and others say that it is harmful for that, because the nature of the fire is quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient that the disease be both cold and dry with that which is cauterized and dry so that it is healed.
And I say that whoever says the opposite, that for the cautery is useful in every cold and dry disease that appears in the bodies of men, because when you compare the body of a man with the humidity of the air with the completion of the fire, you find the body of a man cold.
And I say concerning this word that I have already experienced it several times in my practice
May be, however, I do not say that it should be spoken of that which has already been exposed and exercised in the chapter of the cautery after exercise, and to know the diversity of the humors of men and the situation of diseases in their places, and the causes of these, and the accidents of these, and the space of time of these.
May be in the other completions, it is not about you to fear, and more so in the cold and wet diseases, for already all the doctors have agreed on that, and they do not disagree in the usefulness of the cautery in these
And you know, children, that the secret of the treatment of the cautery with fire and of the goodness of it, is about the cautery with burning medicine, for the fire is simple, the action of which does not reach beyond the member to which it is cauterized and does not notice the other member with it adjusted except for a small document
For the action of the burning medicine reaches only to that in the member from which it is exhaled, and it makes very strong that the disease in the member is of difficult healing and makes it very strong that it is useful.
For the fire, for its subtlety and its preciousness, does nothing but flow and we already know by experience and by the length of our service in the art concerning the truth of the causes; and for this reason I am excused for the length of this discourse, for it is not legible to me in this place in this time the secret which is hidden with fire, and the quality of the operation of the fire in the bodies and the expulsion of the disease by it, which is demonstrated in philosophical terms, which would be acute in the following days.
Indeed, children, I have learned that the most opportune time for cautery is when the weather is mildest in the springtime.
And I say that cautery is convenient at all times, for so that it does not suffer from the suddenness of the weather, being immersed in the benefit of that which helps the cautery not to be scorched, especially if the cautery is for pains or necessary pains, which are strong and fiery, which do not suffer from delay so that it is feared that those which come late will bring malice, which is greater than a slight neglect of the time.</end_of_turn>
I do not consent in empty words, or, children, those who do not esteem except the vulgar people and fools, doctors, for that disease which is cured by cautery is not ridiculous at all times, and pause that consequence.</end_of_turn>
And the cause is not that they say it is because they take care of it with water, for cautery is nothing but in place of medicine which alters the complexion and dries the humors which are the cause of these pains.</end_of_turn
Moreover, however, cautery surpasses medicine by its desire for its value and the virtue of its operation and the greatness of the Lord's gift.</end_of_turn>
And it is possible that your disease will return at any time of the day, according to the complexion of the patient and the location of the disease, and the virtue of the treatment, and what is prepared in the body of the patient from the accumulation of superfluities in it, and what is obtained by him in the acquisition of food and drink, and from those causes; but the disease in which cautery is administered is a subtle disease of a few superfluities and humors, just as if it were cautery of teeth for pain and as it is in this way that it is possible that in it the said pain will not return, even though it is done in small quantities.</end_of_turn
And perhaps the vulgar saying is that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, and a saying of the learned, not to those who understand it, for they believe that it is not a cure that makes use of medicine or of any other cause except cautery.</end_of_turn
And the cause is the opposite of that; and the understanding that cautery is the last remedy of medicine is true only when they administer the methods of treatment in certain diseases, and those medicines do not benefit, and in the end of the cause they administer manes cautery, and make use of that.</end_of_turn And so it is that from here it can be understood that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, not according to the understanding which the vulgar people and fools of the doctors have of it.</end_of_turn
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and I do not say this except for the equality of gold and the sublimity of its substance.</end_of_turn
And I say that the place of cautery does not make it fierce, as it is not absolutely true, for I myself have seen that it does no harm in any other parts, and that cautery with that is good and better than with iron, even though they say so; however, when you do cautery with fire from gold, it is not for you to declare, for it is ignited according to the quantity you wish for the roughness of the gold, and prepare to receive cold; and if you add too much fire to it the gold will melt for the fire, and if you are unlucky in the fire some plates will be broken because the artificer will take hold of it for the work.</end_of_turn
And for this reason it is useful to do cautery with iron, you must put it lightly and more cautiously to the right of the operation.</end_of_turn
And I have already ordered this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have ordered those that are among the feet to be omitted, so that I can relieve the seeker of what he demands of me.</end_of_turn
Chapter one.</end_of_turn>
This cauterization confers upon cold and humid air the accidental cause of which it is a cause of soda and multiple flows of humors rheumatic, applied to the head and the flanks of the humors and the surrounding areas fluent, and multiple sleep, and toothache and headache, and universally of every disease that comes from cold, even as paralysis, tetanus and apoplexy, and is similar in those diseases.</end_of_turn
The form of this cauterization is this, that first of all it commands the patient to be evacuated with medical laxatives, the head being moistened with medicine for three or four nights, according to the excess of the virtue of the disease and the age of the patient and his custom.</end_of_turn
And I command him to shave the head of the patient, and that he make this pass between his legs over a fallen bench and that he place his hand on his feet.
And keep your thumb close to the base of your nose between your eyebrows. Moreover, since the physician has already said of the location of the affected area, sign that place with your finger, and then cauterize with an olive-shaped instrument of this kind:
And keep your hand still over the area to be treated, in such a way that your thumb will gradually descend, to which your hand should be clasped tightly, and you should rotate it
Then gently lift your hand and support the area, and if you see any part of the bone already uncovered, as much as a grain of wheat, then elevate your hand again, and if you do not turn your hand away from the instrument, do so from the other side, until the bone is visible as much as I have said
And take a little salt and dissolve it on the area and leave it on for three days.
And keep your knee bandaged on the border and leave it on until the burn mark of the fire is gone And take care of the area with tetracycline until it is healed
And indeed when the wound remains open, it is better to take off the bandage, because it is better and more healing
I say to you all that the bone must be cauterized until the bone itself, and that you must hold the cautery until all the parts of the bone are healed.</start_of_turn>
And keep the wound clean of the bone, and finally cure it.</start_of_turn>
And I say that the cautery must be applied towards the heel, until the bone feels strong pain in the bone itself, which is the way to make a small incision: And they say that from that area vapor rises from the head.
And keep the wound open for a long time, and finally cure it when it is consolidated.</start_of_turn>
I do not see these two kinds of cautery among men of learning, except in madmen; and leave that to them, for I believe that it is better for your health, when it is; because the head of the disease is of a cold nature. As we have testified in other limbs, and even more so when the head of the disease is of a fiery nature.</start_of_turn
The first kind of cautery is better and more beneficial for you; and from that one here and from that work I have seen health.</start_of_turn

From the head burn.
When in the head there is chronic pain that lasts a long time and when the disease lasts for a long time, and you use sponges, bowls, caps, plasters, mustard, vinegar, garlic, barley, and alum, and especially if it has already been cauterized with an instrument that they praise and which does not help it in any of those causes, then consider that if the head of the disease is of great heat in its nature; and it is not cold or otherwise finds little heat, then that cauterizes with another burn leaves some space. And cauterize that over the nail of the thumb up to the bone is separated.</start_of_turn> Incise the bone and uncover from the bone the quantity that we have recounted and cauterize that with a cautery on the outer part of the head in the area which is called varicose — and that is the area where the wind is stopped.</start_of_turn And rest your hand in this way, and do not uncover the bone, because the disease finds great pain in all other burns of the head.</start_of_turn
I say this burn in this place, because it covers the burn that is made with the instrument with which the nails and the occiput are cauterized is more subtle than that which is made in the middle of the head; and this is the way to do it.</start_of_turn
End of text.
Of the antiquity of the cautery of foreign origin.</start_of_turn>
When in the part of the head there is persistent pain, or widespread pain throughout the head, evacuate immediately with medicines that soothe the head, and administer the other treatment which I have mentioned in the preceding chapters; and all this without any benefit, for the cauterization in this case is done in two ways: either with acute medicinal combustion or with an instrument.</start_of_turn
Better is the cautery with medicinal combustion than that with an instrument, for you take a little alum, pour it out, and cover your head with both hands.</start_of_turn And now prick the area of pain in the temple with a lancet as far as it is feasible without leaving the wound open, since it is hidden.
And now keep pressure on it for a while to prevent excessive constriction, and leave it for three hours; then remove the ligature and pull the flesh away, and leave the wound covered for two or three days, and place your hand over it until the area heals
And take care of it until it is healed.
And if you wish, know that there are many medicines that can combat these, which I have written about in the preceding treatise on medicinal treatments.</start_of_turn>
May the cautery be performed according to this method: use fire for the cautery of which this is the form:</start_of_turn>
and it is called closed clamps, in which the head is like a nail in which there is a small curvature in the middle of the area.</start_of_turn
And place your hand over the area of pain, and hold your hand — so that the wound is not torn from the cautery which is left — and withdraw the fire little by little at a speed.</start_of_turn
And if the quantity of tissue that is torn by the specularity of the wound is as great as the majority, elevate your hand so that the artery is not torn, which is left, so that there is no flow of blood.</start_of_turn
And immerse the area in salt water and place it over the area, and leave it for three days; then remove the dressing and cover the area with a bandage, and take care of it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, cauterize at the extremity of the cuticle according to the incision, and keep the area from excessive bleeding in this particular emigration that is not ancient.</start_of_turn

About the cautery of ancient emigration.</start_of_turn
When you have cured the emigration according to what has been said of the previous treatment and what has been said in the divisions of diseases, and do not take advantage of the treatment, and sometimes for the disease that does not cover it adequately compared to the first cautery of medicine or the cautery of fire, know that you should ignite the cautery of the cuticle until it is bleached, because it signifies over the area of pain along the line of length of which is the majority of the digit, or whatever; and remove your hand for a while and hold that position until you have incised the artery and reached the bone.</start_of_turn
However, you must take care that the mandible is not continued, which is praised for chewing, and that the wound is not torn and that the nerves that are bad for that are not damaged, and that there is no spasm.</start_of_turn
And if it is about the custody and care of the flow of blood of the artery that is incised, which is feared, and more so for that which ignores what it does and is reckless; leave the operation to the beginning.</start_of_turn
And I come to remind you of the regimen of the flow of blood according to the custom of this land, in this place of this book.</start_of_turn
And if you see that this disease does not benefit from this cautery and you see that the patient can tolerate the disease, cauterize that in the middle of the head as we have recounted, and care for the wound until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on the stretching of the artery with two clamps, and this is better cautery and more reliable.</start_of_turn

About the cautery of the pains of the heel.</start_of_turn
When in the heel there is pain from cold and is cured by means of lakes and other treatment that I have mentioned in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then ignite the cautery, and this is the one that has no name, of which this is the form:</start_of_turn
And prick near the ignition, and be careful around the entire heel as if it were rotated, or in the course of any wrinkle if the pain is in any place.</start_of_turn Along with that, take hold of the root of the heel a little more slowly than that because you have to mark the area with your finger.</start_of_turn
And if you have cauterized ten times in the entire heel, and what is that, and take care of the wounds until they are healed.</start_of_turn
Capitol .vi.
Capital six.
The sixth degree of cautery.
Avoid cautery of the species that must remain dry or for spasm of the nerves.
When you have cured that kind of turtura with herbs and capitula and unguarias, and you do not want to burn the patient, then cover the painful area with three cauteries: one at the root of the nail, the second a little beyond the middle, and the third at the junction of two lips.
And keep the cautery away from the contrary side of the painful area, because mollification does not take effect except in the part that appears to be well.
And the way of cautery is that you cauterize that which is above the nail at the root of the toe somewhat more than over the head of the nail, and in the middle another, the length of which is according to the length of the finger without going beyond that. Stop your hand with the cautery when the quantity of the matter of the species of the code has been consumed
And this is the form of cautery, and it is the species of the surgeon, the form of which is like a table More gently indeed is that which one sees here in these verses; and cover with little superfluous thickness a little.
And do the same with the area around the area that is being cauterized until it is well.
Capital seven.
Of cautery of ancient apoplexy.
When the apoplexy is ancient and you have cured that which we have said, and you do not fear your medicine, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize that with four cauteries: over all the nails of the foot; above the nail and below the head of the nail as we have said; and on the gum And the manner of cautery is sufficient as has been said
And it is sufficient to cauterize on the mouth of the stomach; more so behind; and like this it is cured with what proceeds.
Capital eight
Of cautery for painless inflammation
Cover that the patient should not feel pain at the beginning with large doses of wine and serve him medicine that softens.
And then wipe the whole head of the patient and place his gums in the places described in the treatise of plasters
And stop any herbs, for that is the way of cautery And do as that which has already been said.
And thus if for these good ones; and if not, then do three cauteries at the back of the foot, which are dependent on the more dominant part of the head towards the more distant part of the cheek. And stop between each cautery the breadth of a finger, and like this cure the cautery with what proceeds
More if you are addicted and the patient is able, then do the cautery in the middle of the head; and if you wish to be more addicted, then cauterize that over the two nails
Like this cure that which is when it is well; and let the cautery be olive oil as has been said before
Capital nine
Of cautery of carbuncles and of the softening of all the body
Cover that you process in the softening of the head with wine and as we have said; and like this wipe the head of the patient, and like this cauterize that which is cauterized in the middle of the head, and over all the nails of the head, and over the back of the head, and three cauteries over the vertebrae of the neck
And if it is necessary in the disease of the softening of the body of the limbs that the patient is tolerant and the disease is strong, then cauterize that with four cauteries over the vertebrae of the thorax, and then cauterize until it is consumed by the code without leaving any mark, and remove the hand. Like this cure when it is well, and this is olive oil
Capitol.x.
Capital.x.
No is cauterized the epileptic but that epilepsy is for flexibility.
And therefore modify the head of the patient at the beginning and at the end of treatment and another cure that we have dictated in the division when the patient is great and tolerates the exception of medicines.
And if it is a child who does not suffer from medicines, then give safeguards and bitter substances that serve to modify, giving them for a few days, for the benefit of foods
Then return the head of the patient, and then cauterize that which is like a cautery in the middle of the head according to the manner mentioned above, and at another cautery in the nape of the neck, and over every corner of the head wherever you wish to cauterize. And if the patient is strong and tolerates, then cauterize that which we have said, having paralyzed and mollifying the body over the vertebrae of the hip and the vertebrae of the loin
And olive oil be cauterized as it is preceded.
Maybe if the patient is a child, then pause the cautery subtly according to this manner.
Capital.xi
From cautery of melancholy
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humidity and great flexibility, then cauterize that which we have said in the having paralyzed
And if the cause of melancholy is excessive and declining to melancholy, and the body of the patient is humid, then give him to drink that which modifies the head of the patient as it has been mentioned in the division
Then return the head of the patient, and then make a gentle twist downwards from the outside inwards, and then stop that in the middle of the head
And the patient is senseless and falls asleep, and is kept away from all parts
And then pause liniment; and it is more worthy to border against a sheep. And burn that over the fire for temperate heat for measure, which tells that it suffers when it is in it for a month. And then put that in the middle of the head of the patient in the circle, and take it away when it is inflamed
And give the patient water throughout the week a little at a time, along with another regimen of the good things that are not to be taken away until he is well; or if you wish, cauterize that which makes little holes according to the greatest of them, but keep your hand over the area with a cautery in order to order: this is a special cautery that hums the head equally
And then stop that which is hanging in border or in gray of grease.
Capital.xii
From cautery of water descending in the sweat
When it is announced to you at the beginning of the sweating for the signs which I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient to drink water that which modifies the head of the patient, and keep that away from all humidity
And make him sweat in bath for a few days
And command him to shave his head, and cauterize that which is like a cautery in the middle of the head; and cauterize that which is like two cauteries over two temples if it is the beginning of sweating of water in two sweats, or one drop if it is the beginning of sweating of water in one sweat
Include all veins and arteries which are left of the coccyx; and make the cauteries in that length in the latitude of the temples.
And keep away from fluxes of blood when it is cauterized; and if you see blood fluxes, stop any medicine that is to you possible
And I know of wisdom in the extraction of arteries and in the ablation of those and care for blood fluxes.
And many veins are cauterized at the neck leaving two bones with two cauteries arranged one after the other.
Capital.xiii
From cautery of ancient tears
When tears of the humors are old and settle upon the veins and arteries that are in the head, it is confirmed that these are superfluous free fatty humors. Therefore, cauterize the point which we mentioned at the beginning of this discourse concerning the cold humors which cause thirst, and the point in the middle of the head, and two cauteries in the armpits, two on the temples, and two on the armpits of two bones. And if there is indigestion from excess, then cauterize that point throughout the waist of the belly above the little toe with a small cautery.</end_of_turn>

Of cautery for the pain of the nose.</end_of_turn>
When your physician has said enough and has not benefited from his medication, then you shall appear and give the patient wine to drink for three nights; and at the same time take his head in your hand and cauterize the point between the eyebrows and the olive.</end_of_turn And also cauterize the point between the eyebrows with two cauteries above the two nostrils so that the hair is cut off a little.</end_of_turn
And take care that you do not burn the skin.</end_of_turn

Chapter XV.</end_of_turn
Of cautery for the swelling of the eyelids of the humors.</end_of_turn
When the eyelid of the humor is swollen due to disease or humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a lunar cautery; this is how to do it:
And if you wish, cauterize above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries throughout, and let them be longer than the temples.</end_of_turn Let the length of each cautery be according to the amount of the eyebrow.</end_of_turn
And do not burn your hand too much with the cautery, but as much as the third part of the eyelid is adhered.</end_of_turn
Chapter XVI.</end_of_turn
Of cautery of the eyelid of the humor when its tears have become converted to drops and put its hand on the humor.</end>
When the tears of the humor have become converted to drops and put its hand on the humor, cauterize in those two ways, either by burning or by medicinal powder.</end_of_turn
If you burn with the cautery, order the patient to drink until the tears flow freely again as before; and if you put on the cautery, strengthen the humors of the patient with a bandage so that they do not suffer until the tears are reborn.</end_of_turn
When they are reborn and equal, then take the patient's head in your hand and place your hand over the eyelids of the patient with your finger, as with the figure of a laurel leaf, and let the signal begin from the tears.</end_of_turn
And also stop the bleeding with albumin of blood or in egg white over the humor.</end_of_turn
And do this with the cautery that we have mentioned.</end_of_turn
And cauterize over the sign that you have made, little by little, in moist tears, until the surface of the wound is like a laurel leaf, completely apparent in the same way.</end_of_turn
The sign of the completion of your work is that you see the eyelid of the humor already contracting and the tears of the humor already raised above the puncture of the humor.</end_of_turn
And so lift your hand and keep it there for three days, and stop the bleeding over it with a border until the wound is healed.</end_of_turn> And take care of it until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
However, if it returns for any reason, order them to drink again and the eyelid is swollen, then do the cautery once more over the whole thing as you did at first.</end_of_turn
However, if the tears are on the eyelid, then cauterize only when it is raised to its natural place and is equal, and that the tears do not touch the humor.</end_of_turn
The patient should be commanded to rest in bed until the pain has subsided and equilibrium is restored. And let a paste of slippery paper be applied in the form of a leaf of mirtle.
And let him take nourishment of broth and live on broth alone for now.</end_of_turn> namely.</end_of_turn> Or what you will, mix these things together and make a fasting for him so that he is not chilled; and spread a little of that over the paper which is applied thus like a leaf of mirtle, and rest your hand over the heel or both; and let the patient's head rest in the armpit of the album of the hand, and keep his chest still.</end_of_turn>
And let me tell you about the medicine and give him a little, but do not delay until he has felt the benefit of the medicine, because the benefit is in him just like fire.</end_of_turn
Therefore when you perceive that the other pain has ceased, then read the medicine and do not touch him until he has told you that; when the pain has ceased, then remain with the medicine and wash his hand with water; and when you have finished, consider whether the eye has already recovered just as if it had been washed away by the constriction of fire or incision, for the hour is like that; and if it does not return concerning the medicine on that part where you did not impress the medicine and did not denigrate it until the operation is completed and the hand is restored.</end_of_turn
And let rest over his heel near the border until the spur of the wound has disappeared, and take care of him until he is deafened or until he is healed.
It is necessary that you, after your operation, diligently guard the hand so that the medicine does not fall from it, and if the eye has become softened for a few days due to the pricking of the needles in the hand, then repeat your medicine on that part where the eye is softened, just as you did at the beginning, and keep it there until it is healed.</end_of_turn
This is the form of the mirtle leaf.</end_of_turn>
Note that the humors of men are diverse according to their magnitude and quantity, and therefore according to what is useful for you.</end_of_turn

When you treat the fistula with what we have said in the divisions of diseases and you do not fear the consequence of your treatment, then order the patient to rest his head on his chest, and keep his head in the hands of any minister between the thighs in such a way that it is not maimed or agitated on the head of the patient.</end_of_turn
And let rest the heel immersed in the water of the album or in mucus of peas on the hand of him.</end_of_turn
And let him cauterize with the instrument whose form is this:</start>
which is concave, like a tube or a wheel of fire, from one extremity to the other where the cautery is to be made.</start
And if you wish, penetrate through to the other extremity.</start And if you want, go out like this as well.</start
Better is the one that is concave to the chest.</start
And if the fistula is open, grasp it and bring it to health and dry it off.</start And if it is not open, then open it and extract the pus from it.</start
And let rest over the heel let the cautery be well ignited, and take care that your hand does not move or that the patient becomes restless, and let rest the cautery on the gray matter of the hand and break that.</start
Therefore if at the beginning of the cautery it enters the bone, do not do it; but if it does enter, repeat the cautery once or twice, if necessary; and leave it like that for three days, and then rest over that heel near the border and send it away with great exsiccation until it is healed.</start
If after passing twenty days it is not healed, then rest over the acute corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and is scraped as it is fitting in the aforementioned chapter.</start
And thus is another method of cautery, which the first physicians said: enter the site of the fistula and when you have done so, pause for a moment in that cavity where the shape of it is like a bed of nails; and there let the quantity of blood which has fled be; and keep your hand pressed against the wound with good retention, and do not be afraid of the patient because the blood will not reach the head of the wound; and cover that head of the wound with alum of lead or in water, so that the blood adheres to the site of the fistula and heals that for a miraculous cure.
And if the fistula is healed by the blood which we have said of the cautery and the cure, that is well; but if not, it is necessary to administer a purgative from the nose and reduce the fistula to the head of the nose as it will be in its proper place.
Chapter XVIII.
Of the cautery of the wound.
The veins become swollen and inflamed in the lips, and more especially in the lips of children.
Therefore when you cure those wounds by the water which we have said in the divisions and do not avail yourself of your cure, then indeed you must make a small burn according to this fashion:
And the curvature of it according to the form of a box.
And pause for a moment that quantity of liquid which has escaped within those wounds until the burn reaches the head of the wounds.
And thus care for that until it is healed.
Chapter XIX.
Of the cautery of a fistula in the mouth.
When on the root of the uvula or on the palate or on the roots of the teeth there is swelling and the lip becomes broken, and is softened, and the vein bursts, and a fistula is made, and when you do not avail yourself of the cure, then indeed you must burn according to the quantity which is received in the fistula, and put that flame in the rectum of the fistula, and keep your hand over that until the flame reaches the head of it, and after that make some bleeding or two; and then care for that until it is healed.
And thus if the swelling is abscessed and is healed, that is well; but if not, it is necessary to uncover the place and support the decaying bone according to what will be said in its chapter.
Chapter XX
Of the cautery of the teeth and the softening of the veins.
When the veins are softened by humidity and the teeth are stained, and you treat them with medicines and do not confide in them, then indeed you must place the head of the patient in the belly and burn the form of which will come to pass in this way, that you must pause the quantity which is over the tooth until the burn has reached the root of the tooth.
And thus take your hand away, and burn several times according to your wish
And thus moisten the patient’s mouth with salt water and keep it there for an hour, and then remove it, for the stained tooth is stopped and the softened gum is strengthened and the moisture which was corrupted is dried up
Chapter XXI.
Of the treatment of toothache.
When toothache is from cold, or it is hot or does not avail itself of the cure with medicine, then indeed you must burn in two ways: either with a burn from the cows or with fire.
The burn from the cows is that you take the border of cows and burn it in a crucible of iron, and you take some butter and cover it over the extremity of the limb, and you put that which is buttered over the painful tooth until it is inflamed.
And thus burn several times until the virtue of the fire reaches the root of the teeth.
Or if you wish, immerse wool or butter in the border mentioned above, and place that on the painful tooth, and place over that the burning iron until the iron reaches the depth of the cavity of the tooth
More importantly, when you burn with fire you must attend to the quantity of charcoal or iron, and be in the center of the cavity of the tooth so that the acute heat does not reach the mouth of the patient.
And thus draw the cautery in the shape it will come, and keep it above the nail and put your hand over it until it is inflamed; and do whatever you can to make the pain subside, whether today or tomorrow or the next day.
And so, for the purpose of this cautery, that the patient should fill their mouth with good broth for an hour, and then wipe it away; this is the shape of the cautery.</end_of_turn>
And burn as much as you can of the extremities according to your ability.</end_of_turn>
This is the shape of the cannula:</end_turn
Capitol .xxii.</end_turn>
Of the cautery of external swellings.</end_turn
When external swellings are due to cold humors and do not obey digestion by medicines, then you must ignite the cautery to its shape as described below, having two extremities covered so as to escape the smoke of the cautery from the other, and keep the flame above the swelling for a while, and do the same again if necessary, until the swelling has disappeared.</end_turn
And if the swelling is slight, then keep the cautery away from the quantity of the swelling, and let it rest for three days, and place it over the edge of the swelling until the fire that has consumed it has gone out.
And take care that the patient does not suffer from pain, and try and wrap and cover with cloths until they are healed.</end_of_turn>
Capitol .xxiii.</end_turn
Of the cautery of the throat and constriction of the belly.</end_turn
When humidity is over the root of the lung, and especially when it is the cold of complexion, then you must make the patient evacuate at the beginning with laxative medicines, and then cauterize the area where the tonsils are rooted in the indented place.</end_turn
Beware that you do not reach the tonsils or burn the edge of the tongue, but only a little.</end_turn
And cauterize the other side of the cautery must be at the joint of the colon in the back of the vertebra of the belly.</end_turn The cautery of the belly should be similar to the previous one.</end_turn
And take care that what precedes is finished before it is healed.</end_turn
Capitol .xxiiii.</end_of_turn
Of the cautery of the lung disease and cough.</end>
When cough and lung disease are due to cold humidity and the patient has neither fever nor chills and is an old disease, then you must make two cauteries on the furcula in the indented places on the front and back; and another cautery in the middle of the foot between two nipples; and the cautery should be similar to the previous one.</end_turn
Or if you wish, make the puncture with the cautery that is called puncture, whose shape you will find in the puncture of heel pain.</end_turn
And so do the punctures as desired; and take care that what precedes is finished before it is healed.</end_turn
And so the cautery has had three ramps that the cautery is in this: one can make three cauteries in this way.</end_turn
Capitol .xxv.</end_of_turn
Of the cautery of the titillum which is the head of the helper.</end_turn
When the head of the helper is displaced due to oily humidity and does not stop in the hour of the seed return, you must displace it until it is at rest as it usually does; and by a slight movement it is displaced again as we have testified, so that you must first reduce the dislocation, and then the patient must be reversed over the seed two or three times; and then lift the chin which is at the root of the titillum towards the parts below as far as your left hand, if the joint is displaced towards the root.</end_turn
And so draw the cautery twice; and this is the shape of it:</end_turn
And so cauterize the chin until it pierces through to the other side; and the figure of the cautery will come when there are four cauteries.</end_turn
Each burn is adjusted according to this count and because they are cauteries of eight.
And so you pause over the burn with salt, and then adhere the patient to tranquility, and do not move the limb for any time until it is comforted
And if the dislocation is at the base of the heel and it is necessary, then cauterize over the Achilles muscle or over the tip of the cautery, so that the joint is confirmed and the moisture is expelled and the patient is healed.
Chapter XXVI.
Of the cautery of the stomach
When there is cold and moist humors in the stomach that come out of its composition and multiply in it, and if you continue the treatments and do not confirm them, then know that the patient must be placed on their side, extend their hands and feet, and then cauterize three times: on one cautery leave the toes for the quantity of one finger at the level of the Achilles, and on two cauteries leave the two sides of the cautery, until the triangular shape of the cautery appears; and lengthen between those that are not adjusted that will make the burn less painful.
And if the depth of the burn is equal to two-thirds of the thickness of the codena bone
And the shape of the burn should be like this, and if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and this is a burn in the shape of a circle according to this form:
And cauterize the stomach point by point until the burn is satisfied: and know that you must sign over the stomach point according to the quantity you wish on the tentacles, and then cauterize again at those points; and then care for that with the care that precedes until it is healed
Chapter XXVII.
Of the cautery of the painful heel.
When there is pain in the heel due to cold, moisture, or excessive wind that comes out of normal composition due to excessive discharge, and it is cured by what we have said and not confirmed, then know that the patient must be placed on their chest, and sign with three cauteries according to this form and this quantity on the heel beyond the hip bones, the heel bone must be firm to the sitting position of the man
And the space between each burn is according to the thickness of the finger, and the burn is according to the length of the limb stretched out
And do not tighten over the burns more
And if the quantity of liquid that is applied is equal to the amount of the major part of the thickness of the codena bone, and it is not more adjusted; and if the patient is standing on their feet; and if they are not standing, then know that they have already extended their thighs, and elevate the calves.
And you are able to cauterize these burns with a pointed cautery, when it is at your prudence and skill in the art
And take care that you do not proceed too much in the cautery, and that the thickness of the whole heel is cauterized so that the whole limb is cauterized and reaches the intestines, because the heel is subtle here; and know when to stop
Chapter XXVIII.
Of the perforation of the heel abscess with a cautery
When there is an extrusion or abscess in the heel and you want to know if that abscess is in the heel bone or in the membrane of the limb, then if it is in the heel bone, the pain becomes heavy and the pain is acute
And if it is in the membrane of the heel, with great pain that often tires out the doctors from caring for it
Therefore know that the patient must be placed on their chest; and then sign the abscess with the tentacles; and then burn the cautery that is made like a rag, as the shape is described in the other page. And cauterize until the whole heel is covered, until it reaches the periosteum, until it is scabbed over and healed
And take care of the aftercare of the other abscesses until they are healed
And it should not be used in this way of cautery except for that which one has studied in the art of medicine and in most of which sicknesses are known; indeed, with this one one must experiment somewhat on this operation, but nevertheless read that which must be observed.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
From the cautery of the soles of the feet.
Say that the ancient cautery of the roots of artology towards frega follows this manner; and that you take from the roots of artology long and dry a needle whose size is that of a thumb
And immerse that in oil and burn that at the fire, and cauterize with a needle in that place where it is between the continuation of the collarbone and the ribs; and with two small cautery needles you guide, one slightly declining towards the part that is below the beard, and two cautery needles in that which is declining between the fifth rib and the twelfth, declining slightly towards the back; and another cautery needle in the middle of the foot; and another over the stomach, and three cautery needles from the back; and one cautery needle in that place which is between the two buttocks, and two cautery needles from the two sides of the foot, leaving the cautery needle which is between two buttocks.
And do not cover your hand with the cautery, but rather in the sign of the code in work
And indeed I say that the ancient ones say that these are the men who use cautery of iron resembling a ray and ignite that, and put that in that place which is between the ribs, until we have come to that apostema and it is healed soundly, as we have said in the apostema of the foot
Indeed, in this perforation there is no fear of cautery, for so many have already happened in the fistulous place where it does not heal.
Chapter .xxx.</start_of_turn>
Of the cautery of the heel
When you cure the illness of the heel according to what we have said in the division and do not confer the care, then the cautery in it is done in three ways, which are all safe, of which one is that you make three or four incisions according to the length of the heel according to the figure of the cautery needles of the foot, the figure of which has preceded
And between each cautery there should be the size of a thumb or a little more, and the manner of the cautery is the manner which we have said in the cautery of the foot equally
And do not cover your hand with the cautery; and the patient should be even more on the side of the two thighs
And there is another way of cauterizing, which is that you ignite the cautery having two assistants, which cause we have mentioned in the chapter of dislocation of the muscle, and elevate the limb which is in the end of the heel towards the heel of the patient without causing the patient to suffer the left side of the illness.
And let your elevation be such as to elevate the limb according to the length of the limb, so that the cautery is made according to the breadth of the body
And immediately bring together the two assistants, ignite them not, in that place where the other penetrates the limb of the other part.
And immediately withdraw the cautery; and thus there are four cautery needles in total
Or if you wish, cauterize with three assistants.
And keep your care after the cautery longer than it has lain with the laying of the bandage for several days, because it is different from the other preceding causes in the care of the wound
Chapter .xxxi.</start_of_turn
Of the cautery of the heel
The cautery should not be made in ydropici but in alcinte properly
When you cure the ydropic according to the methods of care which we have said in the division and do not confer the care, then cover that he makes four cautery needles in the circumference of the embolism and one cautery needle over the stomach, and another cautery needle over the foot, and another cautery needle over the heel, and two cautery needles between the vertebrae of the two, and one cautery needle in the groin, and another cautery needle over the stomach The quantity of depth of the cautery should be appropriate for the spiciness of the bone.
And so make the cautery incision wide enough so that it will not hurt for a long time.
Do not evacuate the patient from the incision until the cautery has healed over and covered with two layers of flesh, and do not do so too quickly but rather slowly with the help of healing.</start_of_turn>
The shape of the cautery at which it is cauterized is like a clove, as is its natural shape, and that at which it is cauterized like two olives following its natural shape.</start_of_turn>
(The text continues with further medical instructions.)</start_of_turn
On the cautery of the feet and the groin.</start_of_turn
When the feet are swollen with hydrosis and filled with sour urine, cover that you cauterize the foot on the two toes that are not painful in the area between the heel and the ankle; and hold your hand over the cautery and do not move away from it; and raise your hand further up, and do not return it until the sour urine has subsided.</start_of_turn
This is the cautery in this way: Make two incisions on the two sides of the heel, and in any other place where it is necessary to make a cautery incision at the end of the cautery needle.</start_of_turn And the depth of the cautery should be equal to the length of the incision: leave the nail of the nail of the nail and the other under the middle of the incision; and over each incision make two cautery incisions.</start_of_turn
Leave the wound open for healing for a long time so that no urine remains from it.</start_of_turn
And so treat the causes which we have mentioned.</start_of_turn
(The text continues with further medical instructions.)</start_of_turn
On the cautery of the abdomen.</start_of_turn
When the abdomen is too cold and humid so that the intestines must be protected, it is the digestive and retaining virtue, which are in the stomach and the intestines, and it is cured by the methods of treatment and does not confer pain; sometimes the patient suffers a cautery of the virtue manifesting, when it is necessary to make a large incision over the great stomach as is done in the cautery of the stomach, at the circle and at four cauteries in the circumference of the subileal loop, at the clove-shaped cautery; and over the omentum over fat or two cauteries.</start_of_turn
And if sometimes the external humors and the patient tolerate it, then cauterize over the appendix and over the intestines, strengthening two cauteries over the stomach and under the flanks, which is perfect treatment for the relief of which there is no error.</start_of_turn
(The text continues with further medical instructions.)</start_of_turn
On the cautery of old hemorrhoids.</start_of_turn
When they are in the nature of the rectum, old hemorrhoids or those of cold humors or corrupted humidity, and are cured by what has been said in the division and do not cause pain, then cauterize with three cauteries over the base of the two little toes and the little triangular one, and remove the navel cord with two fingers.</start_of_turn
And if you think that the stomach is affected and the food is not digested, and that the face is sometimes pale, then cauterize over the stomach with a large incision as has been said; and one incision over the flank and another incision over the bellybutton at the clove-shaped cautery, and leave the cautery open for some time, and then treat it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
(The text continues with further medical instructions.)</start_of_turn
On the cautery of the heel close to the abscess of the leg.</start_of_turn
When the abscess of the heel is formed, then you burn the area that is like a ray.</start_of_turn And between put that fire in that heel abscess, and finish with your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the healing comes.</start_of_turn
And do that with two incisions or more, because if you do not achieve them, then cauterize each one of them as we have recounted, and treat those which cause pain until they are healed.</start_of_turn
If you cauterize with a large cautery on anything, it is more dangerous in judgment.
If you cauterize with a large cautery on anything, it is more dangerous in judgment.</start_of_turn>
If you cauterize with a large cautery on anything, it is more dangerous in judgment.</start_of_turn
When the nature does not obey the work that we have recommended in its place, and the patient is frightened by it, whether he is healthy or sick.</start_of_turn
Therefore, when one sees fistula in the nature that is old, corrupted by blood and humidity, and it is therefore more deserving that one should attempt to remove it secretly, and to limit the quantity of its depth to what is in front of the attempt.</start_of_turn
Therefore, use the cautery that resembles a ray.</start_of_turn And therefore put that cautery on that fistula and according to the quantity with which you are attempting to remove it.</start_of_turn
And repeat that until you have burned those corrupt parts until a streak or two or three have been consumed, according to the quantity of your need.</start_of_turn
And take care of the burning of nerves and veins; or if the fistula is on the bladder or the abdomen, then take care of all those parts; and do not do anything until the fistula is in a fleshy place and you think that it is not penetrating.</start_of_turn
And take care of the place until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if the place is sealed, and so the matter is detached from it, and remains like this for a long time, then know that it is already completely healed.</start_of_turn
And if the matter is not held in it, then know that it is penetrating or in the preparation of corruption, or falls from those causes of which remembrance will come to mind in that place.</start_of_turn
The end of the text is not included in the provided context, so I cannot provide a translation for it.
Of cautery of the humors.</start_of_turn
When in the humors there is pain due to cold or for excessive wind, and to help the patient overcome the illness, it is customary to cauterize that which is above the humors with a pointed cautery on every humor with a keyhole from which the memory comes.</start_of_turn
And do the same with three small incisions, so that there will be three cauteries lined up, and therefore they will be more effective in judgment.</start_of_turn
The end of the text is not included in the provided context, so I cannot provide a translation for it
Of cautery of the bladder.</start_of_turn
When there is an accident in the bladder due to swelling and relaxation by cold and humidity, and the urine does not retain well, then cauterize that which is further below on the bladder, as far as the edge of the pubic bone, and cauterize with a cautery at the three o'clock position and at the nine o'clock position.</start_of_turn
And the length of each cautery is according to the quantity of the patient's need; and cauterize that which is further down on the leg, or two cauteries if necessary.</start_of_turn
And be the cautery keyhole as it is processed.</start_of_turn
The end of the text is not included in the provided context, so I cannot provide a translation for it.</start_of_turn
Of cautery of the uterus.</start_of_turn
When there is in the uterus cold and humidity, and to help prevent inflammation, and the monthly blood is corrupted, and its provocation is delayed, and there is pain due to the lack of them, then it is necessary that the location should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cautery of the bladder; and with a cautery on the lower part of the leg, or with two cauteries, and that the cautery be keyhole.</start_of_turn
The end of the text is not included in the provided context, so I cannot provide a translation for it.</start_of_turn
Of cautery of dislocation of the ankle.</start_of_turn
When mucus humors are poured out in the ankle area, and there are causes of excessive bending of the limb, and a sign of it is that the limb is prolonged over the other when compared to each other.</start_of_turn The location of the dislocation is found in the area where the boy lies.
When you cauterize the ailment on the ankle area towards the heel, do so in a circular fashion around the circumference of the part, as if making a ring, so that the part falls into the middle of the circle.</end_of_turn>
And the shape of the cautery used for this procedure is like that of the cautery used for the stomach.</end_of_turn>
If this cautery is not available, then do three cauteries with an olive oil cautery.</end_of_turn
And do the cautery according to the amount of spiciness of the entire area; and take care that it is done properly.</end_of_turn
End of document.</end_of_turn>
Concerning the cautery of the sciatic vein.</end_of_turn>
When there is pain in the ankle area, due to cold and moisture, the ailment is cured with the things that we have already mentioned and not otherwise; and when it has been treated, when you have left the cold and moisture of the humors, then you can cauterize the area with strong pills or artificial or similar pills; and do the cautery.</end_of_turn
There are two methods for doing the cautery: with medicinal powders that burn, or with fire.</end_of_turn
There are two scientific methods, of which one is to cauterize the area around the ankle with three triangular cauteries in this shape; and do it to a good depth.</end_of_turn And the space between each cautery is equal to the thickness of the finger, and if it is an olive or large cautery.</end_of_turn
Some people say that the cautery should be done on the middle of the ankle for it is four cauteries.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, do the cautery in the circle surrounding the ankle dislocation, which should be a continuous circle and burn the spiciness of the entire area.</end_of_turn
This is the method of cautery for the sciatica when the pain is limited to the ankle and does not extend into the thigh.</end_of_turn
If it extends into the thigh, then do two cauteries on the thigh over the area where you feel the pain; and one cautery on the heel for four fingers just below the hip bone.</end_of_turn
If the cautery is blistering, and the depth of the cautery is according to the amount of spiciness of the area.</end_of_turn
If the pain extends to the feet, then do the cautery here where you feel the pain with three points or four or more if you deem it necessary.</end_of_turn
If the pain is left after the swelling has gone down, then do the cautery here with a blistering cautery.</end_of_turn
Beware in all cauteries that you do not burn nerves or large arteries, and that for this reason you must be careful not to cause damage to the pain or contraction.</end_of_turn
I have already seen two cases where someone has cauterized the heel and finished the cautery, and the limb became inflamed until the tumor disappeared, and the limb was perforated and corrupted throughout.</end_of_turn And mix a strong solution of vinegar and water, and do the same with the death of the patient.</end_of_turn
And if the pain is in two places do each one according to this method.</end_of_turn
The learned men say concerning the cautery of the ankle that the circle should be like a circle of iron whose circumference is equal to the width of a palm; and that the distance between the incisions should be like the thickness of a date seed or less.</end_of_turn
And draw a third circle; and the distance between them should be equal to the length of a nail; and these circles should be closed with iron wire properly placed in the circles. This is the shape of them.</end_of_turn
Do the cautery over the fire so that it smokes and gives sparks, and keep it covered over the ankle area, with the pain resting on the outside of the limb.</end_of_turn Therefore cauterize with three cautery instruments around the joint at one time.
Therefore leave it for three days; then apply a plaster around the limb and leave the wound open for several days; and finally care for the area until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Say Albucasis: or, friends, for this kind of cautery we have rarely used for the terror of the patient, and for what few have found that which please them concerning him.</end_of_turn>
May these three cautery instruments be for him who suffers from them, and find in that place for them.</end_of_turn>
May these cautery instruments be more lasting than medicines, for you must make two circles having the navel pierced in the middle, through which the guts of the door of the belly should pass; the length of the incision from the navel to the waist should be two walnuts or so.</end_of_turn
And if the space which is between some part of the quantity of the thickness of the toe; and if they are opened and loosened, and if they contain each other according to this manner:
And then place your hand over the ankle, and keep the patient’s hand still on the ankle; and take cold water and pour it between two circles, and the quality of that should be like that of small fire, and keep that for the quantity of an hour, and suffer the pain of the patient the bite and the pressure of the limb — for that other bite is like fire — until the bite stops.</end_of_turn
And then raise your hand towards the instrument and wash the cold water from the ankle with warm water.</end_of_turn
And then leave it for three days and keep your hand over that limb until the blackening of the pressure has gone away, and leave it for several days, and run from it when it has subsided; this is useful.</end_of_turn
Finally care for the area until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if the pain extends into the thigh or the limb, make them sit in a position where they can contain water according to what is done in the ankle swelling.</end_of_turn
This is the manner of cold water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.</end_of_turn Recipe of alkali and caustic not extinct of both equal parts, and grind them and leave them in a new bath from which the part of the leaves should be perforated with a small hole according to the quantity that enters into them ray.</end_of_turn
And leave the other part of the bath another bath of water, and put on that alkali and caustic alive from lukewarm water which you take for a thumb, and when you have pressed them with the thumb for a good compression, and when you have left the whole of what comes out of the acute water in the part of the leaves to the other bath.</end_of_turn
And then adjust all that water, and get another live caustic and another alkali renewed, because that every hour if it remains in movement will have a strong acute quality, which is administered in surgical operations of medicine and in cauterization of the other limbs, because this operation is like fire.</end_of_turn
And so of some medicines which are cauterized widely, such as turmeric, ginger, alum, and caustic with saffron that they should be mixed together.</end_of_turn
And behold the account of an ancient man of the operation and care with which he is cured of ankle and sciatica pain, and he magnify that it is not necessary for any other care, and that he is healed for a whole week just as recommended, because he felt that strong thread in the bath already suffices for that.</end_of_turn
And it is that it should be near certain vinegar, and if it is not found green, take recent figs; and do not grind it with a little of gray and keep it on the ankle where the pain is, or in the thigh, or in the limb, and bind it.</end_of_turn
And let it be left for the amount of three hours or for the amount that the patient gives up the pressure.</end_of_turn
And then put that in the bath and therefore when the limb of the patient is browned, remove that from the sun, because the pain ceases and he is healed.</end_of_turn
And know that no one should use these cautery instruments except for the evacuation of the limb.</end_of_turn
May I say that when a vein is stretched from a goat’s horn is cauterized, take advantage of that well; and make the cautery with this manner: take wool and soak it in olive oil, and leave it between the toes of the foot and between the heel.</end_of_turn
E aprop pren fenda de cabra secca e emflasma aquela am foc entro que sia fayta carbo; e aprop pausa lu sobre la lana e leysa la entro que sia estengida. Then repeat this process and do not stop until the sensation of the bite reaches the ankle and relieves the pain
And this method of cautery is called the cautery of the cows.

Some pains in the two limbs are caused by various causes, such as wounds or bruises or excessive evacuation, and for such causes as these, for the infusion of hot and wet matter
And cauterize only in this single species which is caused by the effusion of hot matter
Therefore cover, evacuate the disease with pills that are fixed and similar to them, that are beneficial over the two in which the pain is three lines according to their latitude, because if it has to be cauterized in any line or more, according to the quantity of the patient's tolerance and the virtue of the remedy
And the cautery is beneficial as point cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cautery needles in the middle according to this form:
Chapter XXXIIII
Of the cautery at the beginning of gonorrhea
Many times this disease is seen in young children; and the sign of the beginning of the disease in children is that it affects the structure around the anus, causing elevation and difficulty in movement
And others in the back are the bones of the two thighs that already begin to overcome the others bones
Therefore when you sometimes see this and you wish to prevent it, then cauterize that which is circular according to this form that it surrounds the cautery over the entire part of the bone without damaging it
And if you wish, cauterize around the bone with two-line or three-line point cautery And let the points be close to each other
And take care of the area until it is healed with the water that we have said
Beware that the cautery is not administered in gonorrhea that is caused by spasm of nerves
Chapter XLIV
Of the cautery of gout and joint pain
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Therefore when gout is caused by heat it is cured by means of treatment and not by remaining silent, for the pain persists until it is cauterized
And that you cauterize the area of evacuation around the ankle with the needles that are not cauterized
And this is the form of the olive oil:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And if the pains go up to the knees or to the other joints, and when these things happen, then cauterize that which is over every painful area with three or four needles of this olive oil
And if these needles are not enough for you, then cauterize that and do not hold your hand too close to the cautery, but rather only as much as is necessary to keep the area still
And if the pains go up to the heel of the foot, then administer the cautery that we have said in the previous chapter.
And if the pains are only in the great toe, and it is called sugra, then point in the circuit of the bones as if you were rotating, point in those two lines
And if the pain remains in these places, then point on the circumference of the bones over every bone and over the side of the hand
If pain persists close to the joints for several days, or to the bones or muscles, then cauterize all those which are affected throughout the body.
Do not evacuate the patient promptly without a good regimen and medication, for if there is a good regimen and inflammation, it is evacuated with this cautery without any other medicine, God helps.</end_of_turn>

On cautery of ruptures.</end_of_turn>
When the rupture is in the ankle and saying the bones are dented under the heel bone, and when it begins to approach, then command the patient to lie down and use soft cushions so that the wound does not open from the belly.</end_of_turn
And follow the patient between your thighs on the two sides, and command them to keep their thighs closed until the bone is fractured or the heel bone or the intestine appears.</end_of_turn
And return the intestines that are said and secure with a grasp at the fracture on the fifth bone and signal the limb that appears similar to a half circle of the circumference of the body.</end_of_turn
And thus is the form of the cautery:
until it is neither too rough nor too fine.</end_of_turn Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.</end_of_turn
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.</end_of_turn
And pause the cautery on that signal with your hand on the cautery, and when you have fractured the fifth bone within the middle of the heel bone; repeat thus until you have achieved in this attempt what you did not achieve in the first attempt within the heel bone.</end_of_turn
And watch cautiously from the beginning of the cautery, that you do not burn that intestine so that on the patient there does not result in death or any great evil.</end_of_turn>
And be aware that when you are making the cautery you do not touch the bone, do not trust your operation.</end_of_turn>
And cover the cautery of children should be subtle according to the age and measure of them.</end_of_turn
And take care of the area of the cautery for three days with borders until the wound of the fire is healed.</end>
And take care of those who are with other ailments until they are healed.</end>
And the patient should rest on the two thighs for forty days until the area is sealed and the wound is healed.</end>
And cover that you abstain from food for the length of the patient's recovery, which lines the belly of the patient, and that the intestine does not come out due to the effort of healing.</end
And when you want to take the patient away after forty days, give him nourishing food appropriately, and keep him for another forty days.</end
Be attentive to work and replacement of food and drink, and of harsh voices, for when you use this regimen of healing the whole patient will be healed.</end>
I say the treatment of fractures in other parts of the belly, and so from the beginning, and do not move, for when you make the cautery of that with the round cautery as much as is necessary; and what is extruded from the navel thus as from the third part. And take care of that which we have said, and do not be adjusted.</end>
And I have already said that the first fracture is cauterized with a triangular cautery in this way, because it is signaled with a grasp:
and a stop line that is parallel to the width at the level of the fracture, and another line at the base; and hold your hand with a claw cautery, more the first cautery is finer and better.</end>
Capital letter xlvi.</end_of_turn>
On cautery of torsions.</end_of_turn
When in limbs for some case or for percussion there is pain and it persists for a long time and does not yield to treatment with medicines, then command to cauterize with a pointed cautery.</end>
E sia le cauteri de tot membre segon la magnitut e la parvitat de lu, e vertut e develitat de lu, e locacio de torcio e dolor de lu.
So if the first burn is successful, it is well; otherwise, repeat the burn several times; for it is known that these pains often arise from a swelling of the limb itself, so that by burning close to the source of the pain, one can bring relief to all the surrounding parts.

Of the cautery of leprosy.</end_of_turn>
Many books speak of a great benefit in burning for leprosy, and management if the species of leprosy that causes putrefaction of fat and melancholy is present.</end_of_turn
And therefore when you wish to burn [leprosy], consider if the leprosy is acute or chronic; and that which has been cured by water as we have said in the division and not by burning, neither this nor that; and fear lest the corruption should encompass the whole body and its entirety, for the burn should be applied to the head with two cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and one at the back of the head, over the eyebrows; and two on the temples; and one at the back, over the nape of the neck or on the servant's hand.</end_of_turn
And finally hold your hand over the burn for a little while until a small ulcer forms on the bone, and when the scales are loosened from it, so that the emission of thick vapor is relieved from it; and burn on the heel as required.</end_of_turn
And if the leprosy has already spread over the body and appears manifest, the hour is that you burn in these very burns that we have said in the head; and burn on the tip of the nose, and two burns on the two cheekbones, and two burns on two vertebrae of the collarbone, and five burns on the vertebrae of the thorax, and one large one on the vertebrae close to the shoulder, and one on the shoulder, and two on the arms, and two on the hands, and two on the knees, and two on the muscles, and two on the little toes; and burn on all the joints of the fingers and toes, and on all the bones of the limbs and on the bones of the face.</end_of_turn
And take care of the nerves that are over the heel that you do not burn them.</end_of_turn
And many are cauterized with a burn on the bone of the thumb and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the heel.</end_of_turn
And know that when you adjust many cauteries, the more the benefit and the more effective; and know that the body has already become stupefaied from the pain.</end_of_turn
And know that the burns should be large or small according to the members and the joints as it is preceded by the species of the instruments.</end_of_turn
And take care of the burn with flour of barley mixed with honey and with another care until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter XLVIII.</end_of_turn
Of the cautery of stupor.</end_of_turn
When any limb is stiff or drowsy and is cured with medicines, oils and plasters, and is not healed, the hour is that you burn that stiff limb with a burn according to the greatness of the limb or the smallness of it.</end_of_turn
And the burn should be applied to the heel entering the stiffness of the heel a little.</end_of_turn And take care of that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And many are cauterized every stupor which is caused by the fingers and toes, and the vertebrae of the thorax and sometimes the sensation of the nerves that move that limb, and is relieved of the stupor.</end_of_turn
More do not presume than one who is skilled in the anatomy of the limb and the exit of the nerves throughout the body.</end_of_turn
Chapter XLVIV.</end_of_turn
Of the cautery of the carbuncle that is eating away.</end_of_turn
When the carbuncle is old and does not yield to the touch of medicines, the hour is that you burn over that which has been cauterized before a little according to the quantity of the species of the heel until the whiteness and the color of it are restored, and the color of it is changed.</end_of_turn
And apply a cataplasm of barley flour, lentils, olive oil, rue leaves, and columb or yeronda flowers, each in equal parts, and mix them together. Then apply a bandage and keep it in place until it is healed.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And apply a cataplasm of barley flour, lentils, olive oil, rue leaves, and columb or yeronda flowers, each in equal parts, and mix them together. Then apply a bandage and keep it in place until it is healed.
When cancer is beginning and swelling appears, then cauterize that area of circle around the circumference of the vein as it is swollen.
And say the learned that it is cauterized at the end of the vein in the middle of the area; may it be that I do not see that it is ulcerated, for I have already seen several veins that have been cauterized.
And it is better to cauterize in the circumference of the vein as I have said, rather than to burn the vein entirely.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And apply a cataplasm of barley flour, lentils, olive oil, rue leaves, and columb or yeronda flowers, each in equal parts, and mix them together. Then apply a bandage and keep it in place until it is healed
When some adjuvants are delayed in maturity, and this is due to excessive moisture or for the state of the patient, who is old and decrepit, or for little strength, or for the time, and you wish to hasten the maturity of the adjuvants; then cauterize in the circumference of the vein without burning the vein entirely. And thus it will stop fasting in maturity
May you also pierce the area that is to be cauterized, for this is the form of it. And suspend that in the middle of the area of adjuvants until it penetrates the cord.</start_of_turn>
And if you cauterize in that place that is more distant, to alleviate the pain of the limb; then take care that it is done until it is healed
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And apply a cataplasm of barley flour, lentils, olive oil, rue leaves, and columb or yeronda flowers, each in equal parts, and mix them together. Then apply a bandage and keep it in place until it is healed
Corrosion is a wandering corruption in the limb, which eats away at it just as fire consumes dry wood
Therefore, if sometimes that corrosion is in the place where you suffer from cauterization like fire, then you must burn the nails without many, and as many as seem appropriate in that place where it is corroding
And take care to cauterize all around until you have eradicated all the corruption and there remains no cause of it
And keep it like that for three days, and suspend on the cauterized places only after three days with olive oil mixed in until the scars have disappeared and all the corruption has been eradicated
And take care that there is no inflammation of the surrounding flesh.
May three days pass before the flesh recovers completely in the place where there is no corruption; for if not, then repeat the cauterization over the parts that remain corrupted
And corrosion is treated in many ways with acute medicine, which is more effective in the place of cauterization Fire cauterization is more dangerous than acute medicine
And I have already said the treatment of it with acute medicine in the division, and therefore take that which has been ordered for it
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors
And apply a cataplasm of barley flour, lentils, olive oil, rue leaves, and columb or yeronda flowers, each in equal parts, and mix them together. Then apply a bandage and keep it in place until it is healed
Many veins in the lower part of the foot that are called claw suffer from great pain, which is caused by large swelling; and this is treated in two ways, that is, by fire and by cold water
It is better to cauterize with fire than with a blunt instrument, as it is more painful; and it should be done with a needle of suitable size for the whole claw, and with fine stripes
And quickly extinguish the flame on the claw, and immediately reverse your hand over the area of the claw until the cautery reaches the depth of the claw. And keep it for three days until it starts to get better And immediately apply a paste of beaten salt and vinegar to the wound, and keep the paste on the wound for one night, so that the pus will be eradicated from its roots
And take care of the wound by applying ointment of generative ointment until it is healed
If it does not improve, and black spots appear on the surface of the body, mostly on the hands and feet, it is necessary that you administer in those places with water, that is to say that you take a sponge or a quill or a sponge of pepper, and put that on the claw; and quickly pour a little water over the sponge, and hold your hand, and reverse that so that you compress your hand completely, and press the edge of the sponge against the root of the claw, and return the warm water slowly through the opening of the root; and wait for the patient a little the biting of the warm water for an hour, and then remove it, for the claw will have its roots eradicated.
And thus do with the others until you have finished all of them that are in the body
And take care of the pus that remains after the roots of the claws have been eradicated by the water of the incisions that the ointment will generate
The end.
On the cautery of the tremor.
When the cause of the tremor is cold in the nerves or from excessive heat, or from another similar cause, it is necessary that you cauterize four times on the spine between each vertebra, and four times on the toes, and four times on the stomach
And the tremor will cease and the disease will be overcome
The end of the treatise
On the cautery of wounds of the body accidentally inflicted
When there are spilled blood clots in the body, and pus-filled wounds that are caused by corrupted thick matter; therefore it is necessary at the beginning when it appears that they should be cauterized over the whole head of the fistula with a fine needle and a loop of wire, or at the root of the fistula longus; or with a fine needle.
And in some cases it is necessary to cauterize immediately at the beginning of their evacuation according to this manner; and do not be afraid, for the superfluous blood will be broken by these means, and the wound will be healed of these
But nevertheless it is necessary to evacuate with a tube of flebotomy
End of the treatise
On the cautery of a fistula of the saints accidentally caused by an incision of the artery
Many times there is an artery fistula that is caused by the disease that is causing the plague, or by the incision of apostemas or cautery of the limb, and in such cases it is difficult to stop it
Therefore when such an accident happens, quickly cover your hand over the orifice of the artery, and pause over that place until you have stopped the bleeding of the fistula of the saint, and that it does not remain
And immediately pause in the flame the cauteries of olive oil a few and many, by number more, and blow over those until they are no longer ignited
And immediately take from those a little or a great according to the place and the disease in which the artery is broken, over that vein tightly holding back the bleeding that remains until the wound is closed and that the saint is withdrawn.
And if the saint is expelled from the orifice of the artery when you have closed the wound and squeezed out the cautery, then take another cautery and cover it loosely over the cauteries that are in the fire, and do not cease doing so until the saint is withdrawn
Be careful that you do not burn the nerves that are here, and that you come back to the patient with another disease.
And you know that when an artery bursts a saint, it is not possible in those circumstances to restrict the saint, and especially when the artery is great, if not with one of the following four means: or with that which has been said, or with extraction when it is not extracted, for when it is extracted the limbs are burnt and the saint is withdrawn, or that it be bound with thread or a ligament for strong support, or that they be held with medicines whose virtue is to restrict the saint; and that they be strengthened by applying pressure with a cushion or cushion-like device.
May he who administers restrictions decent of him and limits stricture with draps or by position of causes comburentz and of semblance, do not confer except with wrath.
If he is not a doctor and has no medicine, when he understands that the opening has been made over that vein as we have said, he must understand that the patient is in great distress, for the sovereign remedy of the plague has passed, and that the wound must not be remade; and that it should be washed with cold water until the wound is healed and hardened; and that he must take care that there is no need for cautery or other medicine.</end_of_turn>
Of incision and perforation and winds and of phlegm and of plagues and of their appearances.</end_of_turn>
We have already said in the first chapter that in all diseases in which cautery is convenient and medicine is comburent, and the occasions and causes of them, and the instruments necessary for them in the forms of cautery; and I have ordered the chapters of the sovereignty of the head to the feet.</end_of_turn
And I will proceed in this chapter with that measure, so that what is desired may be alleviated, when it has been demanded.</end_of_turn
And I say that in this chapter there is terror concerning what is in the first chapter of cautery.</end_of_turn
And for this reason great caution must be taken, because in the operation in this chapter many things are to be avoided, such as the evacuation of the intestines which is with the saint with which life is bound up, the bursting of the vein or incision over the abscess or opening of pus, the extraction of a splinter or the incision of a stone or any other similar thing.</end_of_turn And all these things are accompanied by fear and tremor and in most of them death.</end_of_turn
And I admonish you that you should not be terrified of this, because many veined persons have managed to perform these things without any other casualties than those of the disease.</end_of_turn And it is from these that some recover from their disease, and it is lighter for them than death, and this is for the gentleness of their disease, and for the length of their disease, and for the fear of the disease which means death.</end_of_turn
And from these things is that which gives you hope and speech, your expectation of that saint, and the swiftness of your disease is pernicious.</end_of_turn>
Therefore do not consent to any one who uses this method; and your caution should be greater than your desire and your speed; and do not presume any cause except for a certain knowledge which will inform you what you must do, and to which you may expect success.</end_of_turn
And use in the care of all sick people the prognosis and indication which are the salvation of health and the obtaining of fame and memory, of the savior and of glory.</end_of_turn
Oh, children, God inspires you with his understanding and does not command you except with direction and protection, for what is in his hand.</end_of_turn>
And I have ordered this chapter to be distinguished by chapters according to the order of the chapter of cautery, from the head to the feet, so that what you desire of what you need be alleviated.</end_of_turn
First Chapter.</end_of_turn>
Of the care of water which is contained in the head of children.</end_of_turn
Be wise that this disease does not usually happen to children until the nurse opens the head of the child, when its life is in danger.</end_of_turn
And there are many veined persons for whom the cause is unknown.</end_of_turn
I have not seen this disease except in children; and with all those whom I have seen it has been accompanied by death, and for this reason I consider it my work to leave it behind in those.</end_of_turn
And I have seen that a child whose head was filled with water, the head of which was always swollen until it could not be closed except with difficulty by the great size of the head, and that even when it was closed the moisture increased until death.</end_of_turn
And this moisture is either added between the cartilage and the bone, or is added outside the bone over the braincase.</end_of_turn
When the operation is performed in such a place where the humidity is between the navel and the knee and the apostemes are few, it is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the thigh with a fissure extending two notches beyond the level of the humidity. This is the form of the scar.
And if the humidity is more increased and the apostemes are great, it is necessary to make two incisions according to this method:
And if the humidity is left on the bone, a sign of this is that you sometimes open the roof of the head or the water is squeezed out when you press that area with your thumb against the sides and it is not that which is seen on the face. Therefore make three incisions in the middle of the thigh according to this method
And immediately extract all the humidity; then strengthen the incisions with strips and gauze; then pour oil and wine over the wound from above and olive oil from below for five days; then remove the ligatures and care for the wound with attempts and poultices, and strengthen the thigh equally; and feed the patient with dry food of little humidity until the limb is comfortable and healed.</end_of_turn>
There is another method of incision which considers the size of the apostemes and the collection of the water, for some veins are more prominent in the occiput or in the front, or on the right or on the left; and therefore attend to the incision where the apostemes appear and the collection of the water, and make the incision as small as possible.</end_of_turn>
Observe that you must not incision the artery, and be careful that no blood flows out, and keep the patient still for that flow of blood with the evacuation of the humidity.
The text ends here.</start_of_turn>
When there are multiple ulcers or tumors on the heels or toes, and it is old, and you do not trust in the cure of medicines, the best cure in this case is the incision of those two arteries.</start_of_turn>
Therefore take care when you wish to make the incision that the patient does not move his head, and strengthen the ankle joint with rough hands; and consider where the vein is placed; and the places where some are near the ankles depressed, so that you do not damage them.
And take care of the surrounding vessels with attempts, and make incisions of some part that is acutely painful at the incision to reach the bone, and be as little invasive as possible.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, within the scar leave the artery and tie the others at the incisions to the parts below.</start_of_turn>
And the length of the incision should be two fingers wide, for when any vein is incised the blood is ejected with a pulsatile flow, which leaps from side to side frequently.</start_of_turn
More if the artery does not appear at the incision, take care that you measure the ankle three fingers wide, and take care with attempts, and make it reach the bone.</start_of_turn
And as for the amount of blood that comes from the wound is the quantity of one cup.</start_of_turn And it is little or much that comes from it according to the quantity that appears from the virtue of the patient and the repletion of the artery of them.</start_of_turn
And take care of the wound, and therefore if anything remains on the bone concerning the wound, the incision must be made so that no further swelling appears.</start_of_turn
And strengthen the wound with gauze and silk threads, and care for that which is inside until it is healed.</start_of_turn
The text ends here.</start_of_turn
Of the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.</start_of_turn
When there are some old accidents that remain ancient or acute, for humors of the earth and for the quality in the lacerations of the temples, or so ancient and similar to these, and when these cannot be cured by the methods of medical care and what is not comfortable, then we must resort to the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or the cauterization of these veins as we have shown.</start_of_turn
And the method of the operation and extraction of these is that the patient raises the parts that are in the temples; and understand that the visible artery in the temple is that which is shown to you by the thumb, and that which is hidden is only in a few people by force of heat.</start_of_turn
If it is hidden from you, the hour of the patient's suffering is when their limbs become strong with some warmth; and immediately cool the area with an rough sponge or evaporate it with cold water until the swelling subsides. And thus you take the sponge which is its shape: And immediately put the sponge on the area which facilitates until you reach the swelling; and immediately take hold of the area upwards and outwards so that you extract that from the bony parts until you extract that from the tendon and uncover that from the clothes which you have left behind, from all parts.</start_of_turn>
May be if the artery is small, the hour involves covering that with the limb, and immediately cut off a piece of that according to the quantity by which the limb is elongated and contracted, and do not allow blood to flow, for if it is not cut off, the blood will not be restored at all.</start_of_turn>
And immediately evacuate blood from the vessel a little.</start_of_turn within three.</start_of_turn
And if the swelling is great, the hour is to cover that in two places with strong double cloth or cords of length, and do not cover it up until the decay has ceased and the swelling has subsided.</start_of_turn
And immediately remove the excess which is between two ligaments; and do this in that hour or do it at another time.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, cauterize that which is pointed towards the bone which is pointed towards the nail until the limb is healed, and leave in place instead of that work.</start_of_turn
It is better work if the patient has a fever or is suffering from inflamed swelling; for the cautery is of those causes which help the humors to vanish, and therefore it is better in treatment.</start_of_turn
And cover immediately the extraction of the arteries which you see at the ankle, and keep them covered with fine powder sufficiently to prevent them from bleeding, and immediately apply either a cure with dry medications or make an ointment of herbs to make the wound heal and soften the swelling until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if while you are working another wound begins to bleed from the artery, the hour is to restrict that bleeding, either by cautery or by tying off the artery, or by packing the wound, and hold your hand firmly until the bleeding has ceased.</start_of_turn And if none of those causes are present, the hour is to keep the limb still as mentioned above until the bleeding has ceased, and then immerse the limb in cold water of violent coldness until the pain subsides, and strengthen it as much as you cover.</start_of_turn
And what is more curious in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein in this way having two nails, since you have marked the two places with a touch, and you remove whatever is between them, not burning, until you reach the bone and split the vein in two places, so that it is elongated between the limbs which are not consolidated at all by this cautery.</start_of_turn
This is the form of the cautery:</start_of_turn
And the pain of the two nails is intense.</start_of_turn More importantly, if the pain is less intense than two nails, it is better, for if the pain is acute like two nails close to each other, the flesh is not burned with speed.</start_of_turn
Therefore when there is some thickness, keep the heat of the fire in those and the flesh is scaldingly separated.</start_of_turn
This work is better in every work and more comfortable.</start_of_turn
And the space between two nails is the quantity of the thickness of the finger.</start_of_turn
Chapter four.</start_of_turn>
Of the care of the limbs of the acute and acidic humors of the bones.</start_of_turn
When the acidic humors are present, and it is the limb of those veins which are above the cap of the phalanx, and you do not care for any cause of the medical treatment, and sometimes the face of the patient already swells up and lies in front of the walk like a walk of ants, and the bones of that limb are extended, humify so much that they are recognized as already known, and the nails are scorched by the intensity of the tears, which were formerly recommended in the treatment of those of this operation, but now I do not know any other treatment for this.</start_of_turn
And you command the patient to scrape the nails against the ones which are in the heel, and immediately make three incisions equally distant according to the length of the face.</start_of_turn If the length of the fracture is two fingers: one fracture should be at a distance equal to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length of a little movement of the eyelashes which are on the lacrimal space, and the third from the other side.
Keep your hand away from the arteries which are on both sides, and extend your hand from the continuation of both mandibles. And if the space of any incision is equal to three fingers adjusted
And if you have a pad of sponge or dry cloth attached to it, moisten it with the things which are with which you will cleanse the wound
Then bring together the edge of two sharp extremities, from which this is the shape of the incision of them: that is from the lower part of the temples to the second incision Extract from that all the marrow which is between two incisions on the bone, and place that which is over the bone on the second incision. And place again this pad and put into the first incision another instrument which is called curette, blunt from one side and pointed on the other side
Close the wound of the bone which is attached to the marrow from the bone which is in front of it, and the skin which does not reach the bone, and fill that up until it reaches the fracture which has just been made, and close with all the vessels that descend from the head to the feet
Maybe the incision should be continued until the marrow, and place that which is in the middle of the fracture inside the other fracture
And when the wound has healed, press the area of the bones of the wound with cotton wool
And keep in any fracture a coat of old cloth, and place over those powders soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and anything which does not cause a burn.
And on the third day remove the ligament and administer great effusion of warm water or tepid, and take care that there be oil of basilisk with rosemary and other things which will make the wounds heal.
End of book. V
Concerning the care of the limbs from the parts which descend from the temples of the head.
When the limb bones are acute and continue, and sometimes the bones of the patient’s foot extend slightly, and in these cases the custom is to take precautions, for the palpebras are ulcerated and their socket is painful, and in the front of the head there is sudden pain of toothache and subsequent vomiting, due to the fact that the matters and bones do not circulate but by veins from the parts which proceed downwards
The best care for these is that the patient should eat softly, and immediately make an incision in the middle of the forehead, a little for the width (and begin from the left temporal bone to the right temporal bone; and let the incision be from the bone; and stretch your hand from the temples which are grasped by the teeth). Until the bone is exposed
Extract all the marrow from the wound with sponge or dry cloth and immediately replace between the two lips of the fracture with old cloth or linen cloth And immediately put on them powders soaked in wine and oil to prevent a burn
When you have removed that and you see that the swelling has already diminished, the time has come to cool the bones until they begin to regain their flesh, and take care of that which regulates the exsiccation which makes the flesh grow, as if you were taking two parts of wheat and four parts of barley and mixing them together, or, make plaster of them and administer it to these wounds when the flesh has been reborn

Concerning the care of what is in the ankles
All the causes which are in the ankles are of four kinds, which are either mineral stones or which resemble stones, such as iron and lead, or which are of plant origin such as fennel or peas, or which are of a fluid origin such as vinegar and wine and which resemble them, or any beast
Therefore when a stone is in the ankle or any other cause which does not adjust or grow in the ankle, and if sometimes the stone comes out in such a cause as oil or vinegar or saw dust, and immediately administer the extraction of it, and make it vomit with condiment, and apply pressure to the wound to prevent further vomiting. And so keep your hand over the ankle and remove some of the wool or cloth from around it, since thickened matters cause pain in these parts.
If it is not painful, then administer extraction from it with the instrument called epicaricary spoon, of which this is the form:
If it is thickened with the spoon, it is enough; otherwise, administer the extraction from it with little duplication.</start_of_turn>
Therefore, if it is not thickened by that, then make a needle of gut and insert the end of the needle into the hole of the ankle and close around the needle with wax and olive oil so that only the needle remains visible.</start_of_turn> And so draw out from the belly with strong traction, since thickened matters are like those that we have recounted.</start_of_turn
If it is not thickened in this manner, then take a lighted splinter or a piece of burnt wood and grasp the nails with a quantity of powder, and place that on the edge of the wound, and wrap around it adequately.</start_of_turn And so insert it into the hole of the ankle easily, and then extract the ankle from the moisture.</start_of_turn
Therefore, if it is not thickened by all the causes that we have recounted, then you must consider cutting off that which is causing the swelling or spasm.</start_of_turn
And the manner of cutting off that which is causing the swelling is to cauterize the inflamed vein and extract it according to the virtue of the instruments, and then make a small incision in the heel and convert the ankle to the parts above, and make a small fissure in the heel and let out the black matter from it.</start_of_turn And let the incision be like a crescent moon until it reaches the bone, and when the bone is grasped, hold that back with the instruments at hand; and immediately close the incision at that moment, and care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if the cause of the swelling in the ankle is one of the humors that grows and inflates, then administer the curage and the extraction of it; but if you do not obey our advice immediately, then take sponge-baths of this sort: and administer with that the evacuation of that humor which is causing the swelling in the ankle.</start_of_turn
And do not hesitate when you think that that has already been moistened by the vapor of the ankle, and keep it in thick masses, and draw out the rest with nails or with a spoon, or by incision as we have said, for the extraction is alleviated.</start_of_turn
But in the water in which it is introduced into the ankle, so that the pain uses up its spasm at the beginning, and fill the ankle with about one cubit of old clothes, and hold over that ankle in which the water is, and if by that it is thickened, it is not good; otherwise, take three or four nails of the length of the finger, and burn them in the fire a little, and when they are cold put one of those into the hole of the ankle and jump over one leg of that side and strike the other leg against the leg which is causing the ankle.</start_of_turn Therefore do not stop until all the water is thickened.</start_of_turn>
Therefore do not stop until all the water is thickened.</start_of_turn> And when the water is thickened like this, then you take paper or gut.</start_of_turn And put one extremity into the ankle and extend the other extremity over the fire until it is burnt out the most of it.</start_of_turn
And so put in another gut and draw out the water until all the water is thickened, and then extract that with a needle as is said to be the extracting bone.</start_of_turn
But in the extraction of beasts entering that ankle, if it is small in size, hold it firmly and keep it still, care for it as we have said in the division; but if it is of great size which causes pain at the same time, then administer the extraction from it with instruments and nails, and the cause of the pain is less severe than all the other causes that cause swelling in the ankle.</start_of_turn
But in the extraction of worms engendered in the ankle, when you have cared for that as we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations and you do not suffer your cure, then consider that you must request the ankle to the sun.</start_of_turn
Therefore, if there appears here any cause of the worms, then extract that with instruments or with fine needles, but if no cause appears, then take a needle with a broad handle of which this is the form.</start_of_turn The patient's foot is affected by a severe inflammatory swelling caused by cold humors. The physician must make an incision along the ankle bone according to the degree of swelling; then he must drain the abscess with a pointed instrument, taking care not to damage the surrounding tissue.
If you do not obey my advice, know that I have closed the circuit of the vein with wax as we have said; now administer the distillations that have already been prepared in the care of the worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations.
And let your effusion be like the one that expels the medicinal oils from the ankle with this instrument of which this is the form: Make it of silver or gold, leaving a slight space, in which there is a small hole, and place a piece of gauze over it.</start_of_turn>
And thus do as it is said in order that it be in the cavity of the ankle here where it is necessary.</start_of_turn> And if you wish, take the ray and wrap it around the limb adequately, and then pour oil into the cavity of the ankle, or juice of any herb, or whatever you wish of these medicines in the vein — and that is in the ankle — and then insert the ray into the coto and press with your hand that which is at compression at the same time as the oil is expelled from the cavity of the ankle and the patient feels the oil remaining inside.</start_of_turn>
And that which is infused into the ankle is already scorched with fire a little.</start_of_turn And keep in mind that the cause for which you distill in the ankle should not be too strong, because the ankle medicines do not suffer from that.</start_of_turn
Chapter VII.</start_of_turn>
Of the care of the swelling of the ankles.</start_of_turn
Some veins of young children and some veins of elder people are not perforated; and when they already happen in veins of adult men, swelling in the ankle for pain or for nothing in particular; and this swelling is useful in the preparation of the wound of the ankle which does not always succeed, and some are in the distant parts.</start_of_turn
And that which happens in the preparation of them, which does not always succeed, is in the greatest possibilities of difficult healing.</start_of_turn
And in that in which you succeed, keep the ankle of the patient to the sun and rest in that.</start_of_turn And thus if sometimes the swelling appears, open that with a pointed instrument of which this is the form.</start_of_turn
If the limb in which it is small has a sharp and a blunt part; and the abscess is of two lips like a lion so that it does not damage the ankle.</start_of_turn
And thus if the swelling is for a wound that has been born in the ankle or in the meat of the limb, then do that with fine nails and pierce that with ease until all the flesh is gone.</start_of_turn
And if the swelling is in the preparation of the ankle, then take a ray like a lion and burn that a little, and then put that on the meat of the ankle.</start_of_turn
And thus if you smell swelling with that which the patient finds with ease, because of gravity, try to compress that with ease; and keep in mind that you must not damage the nerves of the ankle.</start_of_turn
And thus keep the ankle wrapped around like the amount of the breadth of the wound which you have enveloped with Egyptian unguent; and do that for several days until you are sure of the consolidation of the wound; or that you take some other thing and put that in oil and grind over it and use that; and if sometimes the ankle has already healed, then do that cover that which you took out and change that for another which you have wrapped in cerate that is useful with olive oil, until that which is apostematized has given way; and keep that until it is healed.</start_of_turn
If there happens to be flux of pus, then immerse sponges or cloth in cold water and place over the ankle, and use another treatment which restricts the flow of pus, which is mentioned in the treatise on distillations.</start_of_turn
Chapter VIII.</start_of_turn
Of the care of the styes which are attached to the eyelids.</start_of_turn
The styes which are attached to the eyelashes are some wet and some dry.</start_of_turn
Therefore cover those with whom you hold or support, and uncover those with whom you wish to leave, and immediately pause over the affected area.
Maybe if pain comes from the flow of blood, then you cauterize those who are loose like barley grains.</end_of_turn>
And the best cautery is that the black blisters and the like disappear when any cause of their origin has disappeared; and when they are cauterized with fire, those origins are consumed and do not return.</end_of_turn>
(The text ends here.)</end_of_turn>
Great pain that comes to the pupils of the eyes.</end_of_turn>
Black blisters arise on the pupils of the eyes for any cause that resembles greatness in its strength and hardness, and because of this greatness it is called.</end_of_turn
And it is an accumulation of great humidity in the eyelid outwards and downwards.</end_of_turn
Therefore the operation for them is that you consider if the greatness is proceeding from them from outside the eye and is widespread; and the cause of it is slight.</end_of_turn
Therefore remove from that on which the fissure is made for the breadth, and quickly drain that from all around so that it escapes easily, and then suspend that which is on the outside and cut away that.</end_of_turn
And if the figure is great, the hour you adjust it with a suture; and care for that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if it is slight, do not overdo it for that because the language of it restores that and nourishes.</end_of_turn
And if the greatness is waning at the margins of the eye you must touch the surface of the eye, the hour you remove the eye and suspend the greatness all over, except that you do not touch the origin, and cut away that from all around, and if the eye is injured by the incision, the hour it will not be noticed in any cause.</end_of_turn
And finally, at the incision, wash the eye with salt water; and care for the area of the eye where it has healed until it is healed.</end_of_turn
(The text ends here.)</end_of_turn
Concerning the care of the outside of the eye from the pupil downwards.</end>
Grayish is what is generated in the tunics of the eye downwards, and especially in children, aggravates the eyes of those who suffer from it and causes them to blur; and it does not permit the clarity of the sun because the tears are hidden by them.</end>
And for this reason sometimes those who walk around always keep their eyes open, and over those who sleep; and over the eyes of those who leave them their eyebrows wet, which have already covered the inflammation, and imminent appearance of inflammation is in the eye; and that when you press on the area around it says that there is inflammation within those.</end
And any way of operating is in that one in which the patient’s eye rests on the palm of the hand, and you quickly touch it and make it callous, and make a circle according to the quantity that contains all the matter of the circle, and quickly touch that over that and cut from all around so that it is aggregated in the middle of the circle, and finally remove that humidity that is incident on the fissure made for the breadth, and the fissure should not be greater than the fissure that is made in flaccidity.</end
Therefore before you make the incision cover the whole circumference until you reach the matter, because in the meantime the process of the matter will proceed by fissure according to the shape of white grease.</end>
Therefore extract that which you wrap around which you have enveloped between the thumbs and the little fingers and rotate between the right and left hand until it is dispersed.</end
And take care that you do not make the incision too wide so that the matter does not reach the pupil and remove that.</end
But if you do not see the matter at the beginning of the incision, just make the incision slightly wider so that the matter is processed; and quickly extract that which we have said; and then cover it with a drape of cloth and wine vinegar and pause it over the area and open those which are dusty.</end
And so when you have finished salt and paused that in the concavity of the incision so that what remains of that humidity.</end
Then care for the one who is well.
Even if the limb is scorched by the cautery, care for the one who has healed well.</end_turn>

Instructions for handling the patient.</start_of_turn
When the humors in the eyes become natural and old, the hour of the disease approaches, and tears become frequent, mucus of the eyes and skin arise from this, that is, that the humors that cause destruction of the eye that is called to be evacuated from the eye. Care for the eye in four ways: either by cautery with fire; or by acute medicine as is said before in the chapter of cautery; or by incision and suture; or by cannas as I will say.</start_of_turn
Therefore keep your hand over the patient’s head; convert the eye of the patient with your left hand, and if it is converted, well and good; otherwise, prick in the part where it is faithful to the limb beyond the margin of the eye where the humors go out, and make the needle penetrate the faithful part downwards, and when it has penetrated as far as—about the margin of the eye where the humors go out—about the humors, pull the thread downwards from the parts above the eye, and convert that part to the ray.</start_of_turn
And so make an incision in the part behind the eye where the greater lacrimal hangs down to the lesser lacrimal; and extract the thread and leave the eye covered with small fragments of lead or saffron, and then put your hand over the eye like the figure of a laurel leaf.</start_of_turn
However, keep in mind that the figure must be according to the degree of elevation of the eye, for in men it is different, for in some it is necessary to make an incision of the greater quantity of the eye according to the quantity of moisture for which the eye is softened.</start_of_turn
And so make an incision at the two lines that you have marked, starting from the greater lacrimal to the lesser lacrimal.</start_of_turn And if the incision is made about the humors naturally as in the greatness of the king.</start_of_turn
And so put the sponge in one of the two angles of the eyebrow, and extract that whole, and adjust with the suture the two lips with gut or silk thread, and withdraw the intestines, and make adhere what is superfluous of the threads over two eyebrows with some cause that you consider, if you wish to do so, and if not, do not cure.</start_of_turn
And so read the sutures of the threads within three or four days, and care for the eye.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, leave the dressing loose from the sutures, and care for the one who has been relieved of the swelling and constriction, because the eye is lifted beyond the seal of the dressing and the adhesion of the humors; in fact, old practice teaches.</start_of_turn
However, in general it is requested about the patient, and it is a good operation, and do not be afraid.</start_of_turn
And there is another method in treating the eye, which is that you sign on the eye like a laurel leaf, and then raise the eye with three nails separated and joined in this way:
And if this is not possible, have the nails, and that which is not blunt, the hour take a needle in which there is thread and put that into the middle of the figure, and insert the other thread beside the greater lacrimal, and the thread according to beside the lesser lacrimal, and adjust between the folds of the thread with equality, and then put your hand over the above-mentioned elevation, elevate the whole eyebrow as high as you have recommended.</start_of_turn
And so adjust the two lips of the dressing with suture, and care for the one who has healed well.</start_of_turn
And if after the incision you notice that there is still swelling from your incision or your cut, leave that swelling until it has gone down and keep it moist.</start_of_turn
Every kind of vegetable that has been placed on the eye that has remained there because of the suture, where you must use what we have said about incision; in fact, suture is more artificial.</start_of_turn
To remove the suture is in this way: And that you convert the eye and split the figure as I have recounted; and then make two small incisions or two fine needles whose length is according to the length of the eye and the width is less than the width of the sponge.</start_of_turn You have already opened the extremities of each limb, where you have the nails.
Then add some external support to the area above the nail, and bind the nails of each limb tightly, leaving the nails free for a few days, so that the pain from the tight binding will subside.
Even if it is late, cut off the source of the pain, and then treat the wound until it is healed
When it is solidified, the nail is elevated and the area is no longer painful.
This is how you should bind two nails in this way: and take care that the length and width are neither too great nor too small
End of text.
When the nail has been elevated and the wound has hardened, the pain will be relieved in the nail area.
When the nails are unnatural, rough and painful, the doctor's operation for them is that you take a pointed instrument and place it on that area of fat and bone, and then that you stretch the limb and nails without causing them harm And the length of the nails should be equal to the width of a palm
And do the same with another piece of gut and hold the limb firmly in place
Then place the patient's hand on the belly if necessary, and let the sun witness your work, for it is a subtle and minor operation
Then insert the needle at the base of the nail, which requires engineering, and make it penetrate the nail quickly until you extract the natural nail
Then draw out the nail and insert it into the alixate, and keep the nails for one or two or three, but no more
Then withdraw your hand from that area once the natural nail has been extracted along with the alixate from the nail bed
If there is remaining alixate and the nail has not been extracted, remove the alixate from the limb along with the gut that you have placed there, until all the remaining alixate has been removed from the wound.
And when the nail has been treated in this way, the swelling will disappear from the nail and the limb, the nails will cry out somewhat and swell up, and leave them closed for two or three days until the nail adheres to the flesh and heals over the wound
If the nail is too short, adjust it to the length of the natural nails, and elevate it until it is even with the surrounding skin, and keep it elevated until it has healed to a sufficient extent

On the care of the wound on the nail bed
When there is inflammation in the nail, and the nail is contracted when it is bent to the right or left, due to poor consolidation of the wound or fracture or cutting, and if it is caused by leprosy, this is useful for consolidating the wound or fracture or cutting, or for preventing recurrence of the same
The way to perform the operation is to make that consolidation and separate the layers of the nail, and keep it in place with a piece of silk or linen until it has healed
And do not neglect to treat the underlying cause of the inflammation, which is constriction; for if you do not do this, the inflammation will return more violently than before
In such cases as these, use fennel as an emollient, and soak the bandage in water in which flaxseed and poppy seeds have been boiled, or in oil that has been liquefied with some of these elements, and immerse the wound in that, and care for it in this way
The key to your care is that you do not perforate without proper engineering, as you did at the beginning
The operation that we have mentioned is nothing other than the correction of the deformation that does not restore the natural shape of the limb
End of text
On the care of the wound on the nail bed
This inflammation of the nail bed that is useful for treating the inflammation of the nail is called true inflammation; and it is either natural or accidental
May the cause of the pain be accidental, from a wound or burn, from a cautery or from other similar things.
And the way of performing the operation is that you take a needle in which you make a double thread, and fix that in the flesh, and that you pass the thread from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh
Then extend the flesh from the parts under the needle and hold that with the needle, and puncture at a wide space. And therefore if you return the figure of the eyelash according to what covers, it is not good; and if not, take the scissors and hold that in the cleft of the fissure, and over that convert the eyelash, and make two incisions on the side of the eyelash leaving
And that the extremities of the two incisions make two angles of the incision, which you have made until they meet, and that the figure of them is made until when they converge is made figure again.
And this figure is the Greek letter: lambda.
And then hold the flesh that is left of the amount that is the width of the eyelash from the edge of the eye outwards, until the eyelash is cut
And then adjust the separated parts and sew those with the thread of silk; and then care for those as we have said of the soothing medicines and the bandages that must be done to make it well
And if it happens to deviate from a wound or suture or cautery, the hour cover that you make a superficial incision over the edge of the eyelash according to what is preceding. And then separate the skin between two lips according to what we have said.
In the sum of the speech of the care of inflammation when it is departing or leaving, that runs in their operation, according to how it is prepared in the manner of inflammation, and that is in the manner of various kinds of motas.
And the skilled artists always prepare an instrument in any way that is possible for them until they make the figure return to its natural form, or in that way, and that disease according to what is convenient for the operation and the instruments in the greatest availability
Chapter XV.</end_of_turn>
Of the adherence of the eyelash to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.</end_of_turn>
When this adhesion occurs to several men, it is necessary to solidify the eyelash more distant from the album of the hair, and to prohibit the ease of movement and its natural works, therefore cover that you remove the ray from the edge of the eyelash, and lift that up, or extend that with the nail.</end_of_turn
And then you puncture the adhesion with a blunt instrument, which is not of the sharpness of the incisions, having made a small hole so that the disease is not disturbed during the operation, and leave the piece of skin that does not adhere to the hair in its sharpness.</end_of_turn
And let your incision be such as to avoid scraping that adhesion with ease until the eyelash is returned to its natural form and that the adhesion is completely healed.</end_of_turn
And then put on the eye a solution of salt water; or distill into it from vinegar dissolved in water.</end_of_turn
And then separate between the eyelash and the hair with a piece of gauze, and place over the hair a bandage of fat soaked in oil, and on the third day use astringents until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter XVI.</end_of_turn></end_of_turn>
Of the incision of the nail and the eminence of the flesh of the lacrimals.</end_of_turn
Wise men know that the nail is according to two ways, that is either nervous or non-nervous. The nervous is like a hard, soft sponge; or it is non-nervous, like white humidity that is frozen, which when you touch it, or force it to take hold with the nail, it is torn and the nail is not held by it.</end_of_turn
And both of these species do not begin until from the greater lacrimal which goes little by little covering the sight and hinders its light and movement of the eye.</end_of_turn
The manner of working in the incision of these is that the disease suspends its sitting in the belly if it is necessary, and you touch the hairs of the eye, and lift the eyelash with your hand, and then collect the nail with a little pincher and extend that to the parts under.</end_of_turn And then take a needle and enter into that a hair of horse or of cat or of ox, or something similar, or strong thread, or double the extremity of the needle little by little and keep that in the middle of the nail, and pierce that with the needle, and tie that with thread; and extend that to the parts under, and scrape with the skin the part of the nail that surrounds the pupil.</end_of_turn And thus you should seize her with your hand at the back of her thighs.
And then you should pierce her with your instrument at the root of the tear duct, either with a blunt needle or small forceps, and withdraw the natural tear from the tear duct so that at the beginning of this there is no further discharge of tears.
And when the nail has become soft on the sole of the foot, as we have said, then you should evacuate it with a sponge of the kind that we have mentioned.
And take care that the sponge does not touch the cornea and that you avoid bursting it, and that the pupil is pierced.</start_of_turn>
Then return the incision with a pinch of coarse salt or by rubbing with fat, and withdraw that which has entered on the other side; and care for that which is inside so that it should heal.
And if the nail is not nervous and you are unable to insert the needle, or if it has not penetrated the nail, then in such a case the aforementioned kind of nail is cured with medicines, and is healed in the same way as before and as I have recommended in the division
And if you wish to pierce her, then you must open the mouth of the patient and take sponge of the kind that we have mentioned with great speed following this fashion: without causing harm. And if sometimes it is rare and is confused and is embraced in that place, then withdraw your hand from your eye and take sponge of the kind that we have mentioned with fat or oil or salt, and pour the sponge into the other eye the next day
And thus repeat this operation until all that is in the eye is removed, except that which may remain in the eye, for the hand must be withdrawn from the eye, for which reason you must withdraw the sponge, and care for the eye from the beginning until it is healed.
And thus repeat your operation concerning that reason until it is healed
The swelling of the tear duct, if you notice it in the eye for a long time, should be suspended on the nail; and pierce that part of it, and do not finish the incision so that no tears flow from it.</start_of_turn>
And thus withdraw the sponge from the tear duct with oil and fat until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Chapter XVII.</start_of_turn>
Of the incision of certain ointments and of what is born from a wound adjusted in the eye.</start_of_turn
Certain ointments in the corners of the eye are born from a rough wound, and it is placed over the pupil, or approaches or expands over the eyelids and firmly presses the eyelids against the margins and is held together by a bandage.</start_of_turn
May the operation in the eye be that the patient's head be held steady in the chest; and take hold of the eye and collect all that rough matter on nails convenient with a forceps or a pair of tweezers; and pierce the wound at the beginning until everything is finished with the needle, and take care that you do not injure the eye during your operation.</start_of_turn
And let your incision be like that which we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with small forceps as these which are collected together as described in this chapter.</start_of_turn
So when the incision is completed and all that rough matter is removed, then fill the eye with coarse salt, or pour it in powdered form and keep it like the corrosive medicines, and rest over the eye covered with a cloth until the wound is healed.</start_of_turn
And if there remains any cause of eye irritation and it is very painful, and you fear excessive bleeding, then withdraw the sponge and care for the wound with oil until that bleeding ceases, and repeat this operation until it is healed, and keep the wound adjusted which occurs in this kind of case.</start_of_turn
But you must always keep in mind all the cures of the eye that are natural or accidental, or with iron, and do not put your hand on any of these operations until you see that that member is suffering from that operation.</start_of_turn
Chapter XVIII.</start_of_turn
Of the collection of hair in the eye.</start_of_turn
Hair so dark brown which are seen on the eye prevent the dressing from its operation, and must be removed from the eye for a certain length of days.</start_of_turn
Therefore it is necessary at the beginning to consider if the hair in which the eye is dark and not another ailment is strong, and if so, then you must remove that hair.</start_of_turn
And thus command the patient to stop their head over the belly, and suspend those veins with an ointment or two, as you deem fit; and let that ointment be of pure duplication in this fashion:
or so two ointments gradually on a body in this fashion:
And thus collect those veins with fine forceps, with subtility, and draw them out an hour at a time, until all those veins are released from their hold and become relaxed.</start_of_turn>
Note that you should not lead the air to the extremities of the sponge; and if your operation is in the morning giving it light, and if you are firm in your operation do not injure anything except those veins.</start_of_turn>
And when you have completed your work, the hour you draw out from the belly of the patient, green or yellow, so that it may have an acrid taste that corrodes whatever is left over from the belly.</start_of_turn
But if you are not able to collect it all in that hour, then you must place all that remains with that which causes the pain, and keep them for a few days until the pain has ceased and the swelling has subsided.</start_of_turn
And thus repeat over them as the mistress of the house manages until they are healed.</start_of_turn>
And this is the manner of forceps.</start_of_turn
Chapter XIX.
Of the reduction of arthritis to the nose.</start_of_turn
When you have cured the arthritis with cautery or acute medicine, when it has been foretold that it is not healed, do not be zealous in it, but make an incision over the maturity of the wound, and extract all the moisture that is in it until the bone is discovered.</start_of_turn
And thus when the bone is discovered, sometimes in corruption or blackness, the hour you burn it with a torment of this kind:
And it is called rough head, and be made without fear, and the head be rounded thus as if pierced with a needle, in this manner (as it is in the following form).</start_of_turn
And rest that over the corrupt part of the bone, and thus rotate that between the thighs said, and press your little hand little by little until you know that that corruption is gone.</start_of_turn
And when anything has been extracted, then restore the limb with drying and astringent things.</start_of_turn
Therefore if the limb is consolidated and the new flesh has been born, and the limb is separated from the disease and remains for forty days, and is not renewed and is not apostematized and does not happen anything to it by chance, then you know that it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if not, then you must not be zealous but reduce the fissure to the shape of the nose, and according to this manner: when you discover the bone again with fire or acute medicine, and when the bone is discovered, the hour you take three measures according to this form:</start_of_turn
The triangular portion of the limb is extended forward towards the limb thus as sometimes it is.</start_of_turn
And thus rest that over the bone, and that from the lacrimal; and lengthen your hand a little of the belly, and thus rotate your hand over the limb until you have pierced all the bone, and that you feel the patient sigh because he finds relief when you take away your hand.</start_of_turn
Therefore restore the limb with astringent medicines and drying things thus as you would remove a boil.</start_of_turn
Therefore when the flesh and the limb are hardened, the hour that the matter which exudes from the pores returns to the nose, so that is more curious about the patient.</start_of_turn
Chapter XX.</start_of_turn>
Of the reduction of the swelling of the belly.</start_of_turn
When the belly swells completely and does not subside at night or diminish, the hour you must loosen the patient, and keep him, and give him calm winds in the neck during the sacrifice; and rest over the belly liniment which is made of acacia and aloe and henbane and gum Arabic, and strengthen the bandage over the belly with fine powder.</start_of_turn
And the manner of the powder is that you take coarse wool cloth four times folded; and make use of those cloths.</start_of_turn
And do so gradually, as much as the necessity of the case demands. And do so gradually, as much as the necessity of the case demands. Repeat the incisions softly and cautiously; and do not remove the humors too suddenly.
Moreover, if the ligament is softened, it must be handled with care.
And do so during the day and night as we have said
And if sometimes the humor has already been reduced, well and good; otherwise, repeat the cautery over the joints and the surrounding area until it is healed

When there is a disruption in the tough membrane of the uvula, and it is prominent and projects outside the eyelids like a grain of sand, and it is necessary to make an incision, then the operation in this case is as follows: enter the needle at the root of the uvula from the outside inwards, and then insert the needle again at the place where there is a double fold of the lacrimal membrane, and make that penetrate and withdraw the first needle according to its position; and then insert the needle into the place of the double fold and bring out the part of the uvula in the circle of the needle, and tighten that part.</start_of_turn>
And then withdraw the needle and place over the swollen area infused with fat and wait until the thread comes loose from the bone.
And take care of the wound so that it is comfortable when the wound is healed.</start_of_turn>
And sometimes it is necessary to make an incision around the whole circumference of the tough membrane within the swollen area, and when the incision has been made with the sharp instrument that comes from the front of the wound, let out the fatty moisture, and the wound will sink down and enter as much as possible.</start_of_turn
And tighten until it is healed.</start_of_turn>

Of the treatment of gonorrhea.</start_of_turn
This disease which is called gonorrhea is not anything other than a swelling which is similar to water descending and is not like that.</start_of_turn
Moreover, the method of working in it is that you make the disease subside over the painful area and draw out the head towards the buttocks, and when you see that the swelling has gone down to the lower parts, and that it is dry and does not descend, and that it is firm, the disease will be cured in this way as well.</start_of_turn
And if it does not go down there, you know that it is water.</start_of_turn
Moreover, if it is not prepared, the descent of the swelling with water, as we have said, then do so by making an incision over the tarsal bone at the junction of the conjunctiva and the cornea in the crown (within the area of the white of the eye), until the swelling is expelled.</start_of_turn
Therefore, when it has been expelled, then you instill in the wound lukewarm water in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have boiled barley and honey.</start_of_turn
And take care of the other causes until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXII.</start_of_turn
Of the treatment of the water descending from the wound.</start_of_turn
We have already said the species of water in the division and what is convenient to perforate with a needle, and when according to the state of health.</start_of_turn
Moreover, you must make the wound subside over the buttocks and hold the wound firmly.</start_of_turn
And do so with your left hand over the inner eyelid if the water is in the left eye; or with your right hand if the water is in the right eye.</start_of_turn
And with your right hand take a sponge, if the water is on the left; or with your left hand if the water is on the right.</start_of_turn
And do so until the edge of the sponge reaches the base of the ray of the tear duct, and do not press too hard with the sponge on the wound.</start_of_turn
And now pierce the belly of the patient and sit down, since it has already been affected by the cold.
And measure the distance from the navel to the pupil, which is the diameter of the eye; for you will see the pupil with the vision of the eye through the clarity of the cornea.</end_of_turn>
And then withdraw the abdomen into the belly, and place your hand over it again, and thus if the water descends too much, the pain which caused the patient to complain will be relieved, as soon as the water goes out of the eye which was causing the pain, and the vision returns to normal.</end_of_turn>
And rest a little while; thus if the water has descended, withdraw that other cushion which was put under the abdomen when the water was being let out.</end_of_turn
And thus when it is quiet and does not descend, withdraw the abdomen easily; and gently move your hand around; and dissolve in the water a little of clear salt of gem, and with that wash the eye outwards; and then remove the eye bandage or stop or dressing infused in olive oil and vinegar and water from the eye.</end_of_turn
But we must also know what is proper concerning food at this time, and keep it on the eye.</end_turn>
And if you do not heed your abdomen when it enters the eye due to its hardness – for some men whose eyes are hard like this – then cover that you take the sponge which is called alberid, which is the shape of this:
And thus pierce that membrane there, do not put your hand in the wound, and do not do anything else until the abdomen has gone out from the eye safely.</end_turn
And then extract the abdomen as we have said.</end_turn>
And you must praise God for his work, whether the patient is asleep or awake, who has descended fayt in which he sleeps over two cushions in a dark room, and who is prohibited from any movement.</end_turn>
And rest in the quietness of nature so that its nature is calmed, and do not move the patient from the place where he is placed until his pain is gone.</end_turn
And let the patient be bound according to his custom for the third day.</end_turn
And thus remove that which was placed in the dark room and restore the patient's sight, and make known to him some causes, and then return the bandage on the seventh day.</end_turn
And do not do anything in the time of care or at any other time.</end_turn You must know that you must alienate water so that it does not excite excessively for great and vehement thirst in regard.</end_turn
If however after this the eye is still dry, then on the seventh day remove the eye again and rectify that which is left in the water which escapes.</end_turn
Then you will restore the sight of the eye and rest on the face of the patient for whom you are responsible, and let him remain there for several days, since he exists in the dark.</end_turn
And thus gradually remove from that dark room and speak to him about his causes.</end_turn
And know that it is not permitted for the pupil to remain blind for several days, and that you must be diligent in your treatment of the eye.</end_turn
And it has been said to us by some of those who have seen such things, and some say that there is a fire in the water of the Ayrac magdaam which is perforated by the needle through which the water escapes.</end_turn
However, we have not seen in our land anything like that which has happened in other lands; and it is possible that this is a new thing.</end_turn
These are the forms of magadans which are most appropriate for those who are ignorant of these things:
And they are to be performed with iron or with needles in this very triangular shape, the pointed end like that which is the shape.</end_turn
Chapter XXV.</end_turn>
Of the care of animals nothing in the nose.</end_turn
When there are various animals in the nose which cause various causes such as a scorpion's tail of flesh or a polyp of the nose; and this disease is called polyp because it is similar to that which is represented by that tail.</end_turn The color of the tumor is like that of gangrene, soft, of a yellowish-brown color; and it is not of the same color as that of a healthy lion.
Therefore, in those tumors that are not fraudulent or cancerous, cover that the cause of the illness lies between your thighs and place it in the sun, and burn the marks of it, and prick its belly once in those tumors.</end_of_turn> Then extract that to the margins of the wound, and then cauterize what you have understood from the acute heat of the one side until you believe that all the tumor has already departed; for if any cause remains from which the abscess is possible, then your remedy is to use one of the subtle instruments with which it is facilitated that no cause remains.</end_of_turn> But if the sovereign wishes with saint or acid after the cautery, then you should stop it when you cover; or if it is from malignant tumors, then you should retract and cauterize that until it is abscised with safety and all the cavities are healed.</end_of_turn>
And put vinegar on the nose, then the incision will be less painful and there will be water or wine.</end_of_turn> But if the nose is opened and humidity proceeds into the palate, then you know that it is already healed.</end_of_turn>
But if the humidity does not penetrate as much as you cover, then you know that there is no tumor in the pus surrounding the bones of the nails to which it does not reach the abscess.</end_of_turn>
Therefore you must enter firmly with faith in him to whom any greatness belongs, and do not touch anything, but pause between each touch the quantity of the thumb or less, and take away the disease and put a limb of the faith on the nails at the ray or for any other cause for which it is possible.</end_of_turn
And when that has been done, that you take away the bad odor until it reaches the canals of the nails, and that you smear it over the greasy skin, for the troops that are observed to make the girls faint in the schools do the same thing, and it is a light cause for those who wish to do it.</end_of_turn
And then withdraw both limbs of the faith, one that goes out through the nose and the other that remains in the nose, and then administer a dose of ointment to the nails that are on the faith, and do that until you know that the tumor is already in the nails of the faith.</end_of_turn
And then extract the faith, and pause in the nose with the abstraction of the saint a covering, and do that for three days or more until the wound is completely healed.</end_of_turn
And at the end of the case, pause in the nose a catheter of lead for five days until it is healed.</end_of_turn
But if you are negligent in your care, use that one.</end_of_turn>
And this is the form of the instrument that captures the perfumed oil and medicines in the nails:
And do that of silver or of gold, which is similar to a small lamp, with a wick, and a head that is similar to a nut.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, make a closed tube like that of a tube, and the tube of the capturing instrument and make it flat, uncovered; to which you must put that which you will collect from the oil or from the substances that you wish from the extracts.</end_of_turn
The end.</start_of_turn>
From there it is in the extremities of the nose.</start_of_turn
The girls faint is a natural thing in the extremities of the nose, and is magnificent and commendable for five days until it is perceived otherwise.</start_of_turn
And for that you must encourage that at the beginning of the appearance of the disease, and you will inherit all that.</start_of_turn And pause about the area or cauterize or apply a burning medicine that is in the place of it.</start_of_turn
But if it is delayed in its beginning until it is magnificent, consider if it is softened, hard, of yellowish color and little feeling, for it does not touch that which is the cause of the abscess; for girls faint at that which incites this abscess because of its great malice towards that to which it is opposed.</start_of_turn
If the afterbirth is of a tawny color and not of a dark hue, and sometimes when it begins, it is possible in every case, the doctor evacuates the bad air and instills fear in the patient, and treats the area with that which exists and restricts until it is healed.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
From the suture of the nose and of the lips and of the ear when continuity is dissolved by plague or by a wound.
Witches that when an accident causes the solution of continuity in one of these cartilages, few confer in that operation except for a few men.
Therefore cover, when you must deal with some cause of these, that you consider if it is a fresh plague or not, and when you have adjusted the two lips of the plague with a suture, then treat that which is within until it is healed
And if the lips of the solution of continuity are already separated, and some part is healthy, then cover that you scour some part of its apparent backbone until it is healed And adjust the two lips with a suture and strengthen those, and over those sprinkle salt and lead dust, and place over the powder a piece of thick gauze, or of some other consolidating plaster, and leave that bound for two days or three, and then remove that and change that plaster and leave that until they are healed.
May the manner of the suture be that you add the solution of continuity or with needles as we have recommended in the suture of the belly, or add the solution of continuity with a thread as well as you do and make known.

Of the extraction of that cause which occurs in the two lips in the parts of the teeth.
Mothers who are pregnant must go to many men in the parts of their lips at their teeth some apostemas that look like grass seeds, and some of them are smaller and some are larger
Therefore cover that you convert the lips and wounds each one of those hard substances throughout, and over that put a poultice of lead dust until the wound is contracted, and then wash it with wine and treat the area with that which is astringent, until it is healed

Of the insertion of the horn adjusted in the gums
Great is the number of women who do not know how to adjust the horn which they call albulus, where cover that you suspend that on a hook or that you have those with the forceps and insert that must be their reason, and read that the blood runs or that it is healed.
And over that put some powder astringent or another adhesive or excitative powder
And if that horn returns, then instill that again subsequently, and cauterize that, because that will prevent it from returning.

Of the reason for teeth with iron
When in the surface of the teeth of the parts of the teeth and of the furrow and between the gums are adjusted sharp scales, legs, and some women are of black bile and are harmful citrine or vermicular until the gum sees by that which is corrupted and is harmful to the teeth that are left.
Therefore cover that you make the patient vomit between his teeth and stop his head in the belly, and rasp the teeth in which those scales appear to be like sand until no remains any cause, and that which is of the black bile and of the citrine and of the others that are modified
Therefore if that is the last of the reason that is in those of the commencement of the ratio, it is not; and if not, then you must repeat the ratio over those to the other day and the next and the next until it comes to the fourth state in that which you want it
And know that the teeth have needed various movements of different forms and various figures according to how it is prepared for your operation And for so that the razor with which the tooth is shaved is another of the razor with which it is shaved between the teeth according to other forms, and these forms of shaving must be prepared by you that you see

Capital. When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</end_of_turn>
Because when you cure the tooth from its pain in all its entirety, there is no more cause that makes the evil of its absence when it is eradicated, which is a sublimed substance that must be excused in the eradication of it.</end_of_turn>
May be when the disease is forceful that the tooth must be eradicated, you must declare that it is the painful tooth, because its absence removes the cause of the pain from the disease and makes it appear in the healthy tooth. Eradicate that one and then the pain ceases until the painful and diseased tooth is eradicated, for we have seen this in the operation of the barbers.</end_of_turn
Therefore, as you must be certified what is the painful tooth, and that you know well, when you scarify in the circumference of the tooth with space around it in which there is any virtue, until it is dissolved from the root of the tooth in its entirety, and you must do so cautiously, because those who say that the tooth should be extracted at the beginning do so superficially.</end_of_turn
And indeed, you must have something strong in your hand for good speaking or for great stupidity, and keep the head of the disease between the painful teeth that you must not touch, and gently extract the tooth according to the rule without causing greater pain to the patient.</end_of_turn
And thus if you are not forgetful, when you have one of those instruments, put it aside from all parts with ease and make the extraction easier from the beginning.</end_of_turn
But if the tooth is brittle or rotten, you must hold that fracture and strengthen that part with a thin ray to prevent it from cracking in the time of your constriction about that one that you hold.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must work cautiously around the circumference of the gum and keep your strength that you do not break that one and leave it fractured, and return over the patient for the mischief that is greater than the first pain of the disease.</end_of_turn
And keep in mind that you must not do what ignorant barbers do in their fisting and boldness about the eradication of their patients, for they do not administer what we have recommended. Because the veguada makes greater the great diseases that are more difficult to cure, and the reasons for their remaining are all gone, or some of them, or that they extract that one while the others remain in the mandible as we have seen in many cases.</end_of_turn
And finally, after the eradication of the tooth, rinse the mouth with wine vinegar or wine with salt.</end_of_turn>
And if blood flows from the wound to help, just as we have seen, keep any amount of sage and sprinkle it over the wound, and if you do not provide that sage, cauterize.</end_of_turn
The form of the forceps and subtle nails with which it is grasped at the beginning is long handle and broad head, so that they do not bend when working.</end_of_turn
And indeed, as sometimes with large nails when you first start using them, they are not bent, but are short handled.</end_of_turn
And they are useful from India iron nails, useful for extracting teeth that are intertwined with each other and that break for strong constriction, and some of those who have seen them say that they are like the beak of a heron, that is to say, wide and strong.</end>
Capital.
Of the eradication of teeth and the extraction of the fractured bones of the mandibles.</end_of_turn>
When the tooth must be eradicated because it is fractured, keep the surrounding area around the wound still for a day or two until the area is softened; and in the meantime apply an emollient or dressing to the area which is like the beak of a heron called ciconia or guanta, the form of the forceps:</end_of_turn
The nails of those instruments are useful as well as lime or aloe.</end_of_turn
And if you do not obey my order with these forceps or nails, keep in mind that you must give up the reason and uncover all the flesh and insert the instrument which has no name, so it is a small lever whose form is like this:</end_of_turn
And be of short handle large and wide a little, and do not be afraid that it is broken.</end_of_turn
Therefore if the reason for the pain is excessive heat, it is not good; but if so, help me with other instruments, of which these are the forms: the form of the first instrument is triangular, emitted in which there is any thickness.
The form of the second instrument is that it is triangular and has a pointed extremity
And already I have helped with this instrument having two slopes of which this is the form accordingly: and other instruments which I will enumerate in order of their teeth; for the help of this instrument which is assembled like a large bowl, and this is the form:
of the triangular extremity either round or short, which is any thickness, and which is not flattened so as to be broken
And so are the other instruments of the teeth more or less like the others
More skilled are the artificers and learned in the art, they find for themselves various means according to what they understand of the operation and the various diseases; for these diseases of which the ancients did not say or even name their own instruments, for the forms of diverse species.
More if the bone of the jaw or of the other bones of the mouth is fractured, or if they are loosened, then the foot should be kept carefully in that place where it is convenient for the instruments and forceps which we have mentioned in the extraction of the roots of the teeth, and help me with managing this which is the form
And it is of any great or small size, and is bound or held with the mouth so that it does not escape or flee until the bone is completely healed; and then restore the place with appropriate medicines at that time
More if in the bone is a little wound, then scratch that from that wound and from its blackness, and care for that until it is healed
Chapter XXXII.
Of the care of the teeth eminent over the others
When the teeth are prominent not according to their natural course for those of this shape is jagged, and especially when it comes to the women, and especially to the beloved; therefore you must consider: if the tooth is not at all close to another tooth, and it is not possible to ligate or support it, then leave it as it is; but if it is not annexed to another tooth, then you should apply this instrument of which this is the form; and it is like a pig's jaw, and is made of Indian steel of extramitted not sharp.
And let your incision be at the place where you are applying that in a few days for the hardness of the tooth, and that it is not like the others of the teeth
And if the prominent tooth is exposed to filing, then file that with a file of Indian steel of which this is the form:
And it must be of Indian steel and the mark must be clearly seen; and it must be like a file with which needles are made, with which the tooth is to be filed little by little in a few days with ease, so that no other tooth is damaged or falls out And return the thread to the end, and scratch that from the corners of the wounds.
And if it is a tooth from which a part is fractured and the tongue is led, then cover that until the expectation of that fragment is over and it is equalized, and it is to be filled so that the tongue does not burn or the word does not corrupt
Chapter XXXIII.
Of the restoration of teeth decayed with gold or silver.
When the teeth before with concussion and removal by percussion or extraction, and the disease does not subside over what is eaten, and you have cured that with medicinal substances, and it has not been of any use, then so that they do not fall out is necessary to make an inlay of gold and not of silver, for silver turns green and soon becomes poor in a few days, whereas gold never changes.
And let the gold be of such fineness and thickness as is necessary to enter between the teeth; and the form of the restoration is that you take the gold and take twice its thickness between two healthy teeth, and that it grows between two curves of the gold between two decayed teeth, or if one or two, until the fabric reaches the healthy tooth of the other side And then repeat the thread inside the part from which you started, and strengthen your hand with ease and wisdom until it is not decayed.
And let your stroke be with which you strengthen the gold be over the roots of the teeth so that it does not escape
And immediately cut away the superfluous parts surrounding the forceps or tonsils, and add them to each part of the body, and convert them and the hidden ones between the sound tooth and the bad tooth, so that they do not cause damage to the tongue. And immediately remove that which extends as far as Rome.
More if it is slipped or swollen, stretch that or those to the other side in such a way at all times
And this is the form of teeth and the figure of the rectification of two sound teeth and two bad teeth, as sometimes these are bound:
And when a tooth or two are returned, immediately close the sockets in which they were, and let them recede as we have recommended, and that they remain closed
And do not do anything but a good craftsman and a wise man.
Every ulcer is suitable for any cause of bone disease, and it is useful for them as a remedy as regards the formation of teeth, and is placed in the place where the tooth is lacking, and is strengthened as we have said, and remains and serves in that place for a long time.
Chapter XXXIV
Of the incision of the ligament which is in the tongue and prevents that which is spoken
This ligament which is left behind the tongue has some ulcers or is natural to it which a man does not know, or accidentally caused by plague which has already hardened
And the operation in it is that you burn the mouth of the patient, remove all that exists in the belly; and elevate the tongue, and immediately cut that ligament nerves as much as necessary until the tongue is freed from its retraction.
More if in that there is any hardness or denudation, and that which is left for the consolidation of plague, when you have cut once you will split that for the width until you have cut through the ligament and the nodulation has been dissolved
And take care that there be no excessive fissure in the preparation of the flesh and that you cut here with a pointed instrument and go away from the blood flow of the saint
And immediately wash away the remnants of the incision with oil or wine or with cold water; and immediately stop leaving the tongue loose; so that it does not solidify with any ulcer.
More if there is blood flow from the veins, stop over the wounded area with a soaked cloth; more if the blood boils, when you have cauterized the area with the cautery which you have previously recommended. And immediately take care of the other causes until it is healed.
Chapter XXXV
Of the extraction of wisdom from leaving the tongue
Some ulcers happen to leave the tongue swollen resembling a small hill which hinders the natural operation of the tongue; and when it has become inflamed it is greatly increased until the mouth is dry
And the operation in it is that you burn the mouth of the patient sitting before the sun and consider the swelling
And if sometimes you see a yellow or black spot, hard, to which the patient feels no sensation, then do not touch that which is rotten.
And if it is inclined to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then immediately put on the thumb in it, and cut that with a sharp instrument, and cut off all of it; and if there is blood flow from the wound during the operation, immediately stop it by pressing the bleeding, so that it is not dry, until the blood has clotted
And immediately return to your work until you have completed it, until it has been washed with wine and salt; and take care of that which is left of the other care until it is healed
Chapter XVI
Of the extraction of the wisdom from two ears and that which is nothing in the gullet and from the other wisdoms
When it is swollen in the gullet, so are the glands which are assembled together and which are outside and are not nourished by two ears, which when you cure with water as we have said in the division and it is not healed, then you consider if the wisdom is hard, of yellow color, with little sensation, then do not touch that which is rotten
And if it is of a brown color and the reason is large, then do not touch that which is rotten for the flow of blood; remove that which is soft, and you either extract that or it will break by itself
If it is pale in color, radon, and the reason is subtle, then that is that it is likely an injury.
If you consider the patient's condition, giving an account of your operation, if the swelling has subsided or diminished in any way; then do you cause the patient to cough strongly, turn their head to the side, and open their mouth, while the attendants grasp between their thighs according to the patient's tongue, leaving an instrument of noble kind in their hand.</end_of_turn>
Whether of silver or gold, and subtle as a coat.</end_of_turn>
Thus, when you promise this to the patient and show them the swelling, and touch that which is in the abdomen, then take hold once and leave the other in its place, and pull the other outwards as much as you can.</end_of_turn The other thing that you pull is any cause of the tunics, and in this way you apply that instrument of which I have spoken.
The other thing that you pull is any cause of the tunics, and in this way you apply that instrument of which I have spoken. It is joined like forceps, however the extremities of it are bent, so that the orifice of each one is at the end of the other, not acute, which is of iron without a bevel.</end_of_turn
Or if this instrument is not at hand, then apply that which is like a sponge: and be acute from one side, not from the other side.</end_of_turn>
And having incised one wound, then the other is to be incised in the same manner as the first wound, and then keep the wound closed with water from a jug.</end_of_turn
Or if there flows forth pus, keep water of decoction of poppy seed or of chamomile flower and remain as I have said of the causes mentioned above until the flow of the pus is restrained, and take care of that which remains until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And many herbs grow in the ground, other swellings, others two carbuncles, and these are to be incised as I have said above concerning the incision of two wounds together.</end_of_turn
And I have already treated a woman with swelling in the groin who was lying in the ground of the field, who had swelling which tended towards a dark color, little sensation, which already closed the field of the groin, and the woman breathed with great difficulty, and had been forbidden food and drink of water, and was on the verge of death if more days had passed for a day or two.</end_of_turn>
The swelling had already become so great that there were two fist-sized holes between which the surgeon had to pass two fingers.</end_of_turn
Therefore I must cut fistulately and remain with one of them once, and pull out the other, and when it is pulled out, I take away from it a great part, and I apply that which I have mentioned concerning the incision of the other hole, and I open the mouth of it, and I compress its tongue, and I remain with the finger in the wound.</end_of_turn
And I take away a great part of it, and there runs from it only a little pus.</end_of_turn Therefore the groin of that woman is absolutely saved, and she begins to drink water so soon, and I do not cease to incised that swelling until much time has passed, and there follows swelling in its place, which I must also incised as long as that lasts.</end_of_turn
Therefore I went and cauterized the groin of her, so as to avoid infection; and I remained there and did not depart until I had beheld that from God.
The end of the text.
From the incision of the heel when it is swollen.</end_of_turn>
When the heel becomes soft and is swollen and is long, then it is not called perpendicular; and if it is in the outer part large and round, and then it is called bubble.</end_of_turn
Or when it is cured with the water that we have said in the division, and you do not neglect your care, sometimes the swelling will go away and be subtle, when the time has come; and if it is at that length, and there is blood, of a yellow or black color, and it is not to its centimeter, then you must fear the incision, for in that case there is fear of the patient.</end_of_turn
And when you see that according to the manner that I have said of its paleness and length, that you must make the patient cough and praise the tongue with the instrument of which we have spoken concerning its shape, and you remain with the finger in the wound and pull out the other.
And know that you should only insert that which is adjusted according to the natural tendency of the limb, for if you insert too much, you will cause them to swell.
And if you insert, use of that which we have recommended in the incision of two incisions, and take care that it is sound.</end_of_turn>
More if the ailment is spread by the incision, cover that you use an engine in the cautery of it for fear, and the manner of handling the cautery is nothing but acute water, and it is that you hold the patient's head still, and immediately take hold of the tongue with the instrument that we have mentioned, and immediately pour water that we have mentioned in the chapter of cautery, and comfort her with that cause life, and stop that from spreading or becoming soft, and from that fill the cavity of the instrument which is like this:
Or the evacuation of the cavity in which the medicine has been placed just like the cavity of a bowl of ray, and hold the instrument with the medicine on the lip, and the patient will spit over the side of the lip so that saliva or mucus from the mouth of that for the intrinsic medicine, so that it does not remain from that cause any cause on the palate of him and that he evacuate that.</end_of_turn>
And immediately put your hand on the medicine, and press that against the uvula for a space of a minute until it has become softened and calmed by the bite of the medicine.</end_of_turn>
And if you wish, take a sponge and cover that over the limb of the ray, and immerse the sponge in the medicine, and put the ray on the sponge in a tube so that the sponge adheres to that tube, and do that for as long as you wish until you achieve what you desire from the cautery of the toe, and immediately stop that so that it dries up and falls off within three days or four.</end_of_turn>
And if you think that the medicine should be repeated, repeat that, and immediately stop the cautery from spreading in the circuit of the toe at the base of the nail, and modify that which is in the circuit of the medicine, and let it be washed with fresh water, and let it be cured with ointment, and let him rest until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And this kind of treatment is more saving than incision and more lasting for fear.</end_of_turn>
Some women are cured of the ulcer with that which is more subtle than cautery and incision, which is cured by fumigation in this manner: prescribe calamine, rue, origium, ruda, bitter almonds, chamomile, broth and similar to those of the herbs, and adjust all these causes, or some of them, in a wave, and let them be submerged in strong vinegar, and bubble; and the wave be given to her to drink adequately, and in the middle of the wave put a bandage, over which is placed an instrument of copper according to this manner; let it be made of silver or copper.</end_of_turn
And let her put her limb into the mouth of the patient until the vapor makes the uvula rest on the canula, until the uvula is not opaque.</end_of_turn
And immediately repeat that until it is dry, and take care that you do not perform this treatment at the beginning of an attack, because it would be too strong for the attack, and do not say that you are performing it, but declare that it is the cautery.</end_of_turn
More if you do not have this instrument at hand, then take a tube and apply to the limb of the ray a piece of sponge, so that the mouth of the patient is cleaned, because the sponge of the sponge prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.</end_of_turn
And this treatment is good for health.</end_of_turn

Of extractions of splinters and that which adheres to the palate and the other causes.</end_of_turn
A splinter or any other cause adheres to the palate or nail of the foot or any other cause.</end_of_turn
Then cover that you extract that which is apparent, on which you cast your gaze, for because you touch the tongue with the instrument that has a sole, so that you are told that that which is in the throat.</end_of_turn
And that which is not apparent and is hidden in the throat, cover that you make the patient vomit the patient before the food is digested in the stomach, for that strengthens the cause that is annexed to the throat if it is forced out by vomiting; or that he swallow the patient one spoonful of honey or radish or a piece of bread soaked in vinegar; or give him to drink one spoonful of sea sponge soaked in oil and bind that firmly with faith, and immediately give the patient that, for when it gets to the place where the thorns are and is extracted, the patient will have forgotten it.</end_of_turn E mays pren una anguila e be am fiel liada, e sia dedintz mesa e soptament sia extrayta; o pren un porr e soptament le metas e soptament l’en tratz.
If these causes have not been forgotten, then use a lead instrument in this way: ...
Make it thicker than a small ray, and in the extraction of it there should be a concavity which you will put into its groove easily
And elevate the heel of the patient slightly, and keep your hand from the heel of the limb to the groin, so that it does not touch the intestines or the bone, or that the hand of the physician should be on the chest.
However, when the patient is in pain, for his knowledge of the place of the underlying cause and the pain that is in it, and pulls his hand towards the instrument in his hand, as much as he is prepared to do so until it is forgotten
Chapter XXXIX.</start_of_turn>
Of the extraction of a blood vessel that is attached to the groin.
When the blood vessel has been treated with what has been said in the division of the cure with medicines and has not been relieved, consider the time of the patient in the groin towards the sun, because you have compressed the tongue of the patient with the instrument that we have recommended
Therefore, if the blood vessel has sometimes burst, extract that one little or slightly bent downwards adequately.</start_of_turn>
And if it is not possible for you to extract it, take a curved needle and insert it into the groin of the patient, and when you have placed it in the cavity of the needle put a burning iron on the concavity of the needle, and do this for as long as the blood vessel is dead and is not hindering the groin.
And keep a vessel filled with cold water nearby, and open its mouth in that place, and wash the mouth with that; and do not do anything else with that, but keep the water there for an hour or two with your hand, until the blood vessel has recovered as much as the water has cooled down.</start_of_turn>
However, if it is not forgotten as we have recommended, keep the patient calm by hand or by means of an instrument that we have recommended in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so that it will fall.</start_of_turn
This is another way of operating in the fumigation of that, that you take a bowl in which there are burning coals and cover the bowl with a cover, and there is a hole in the middle of the cover, and put the extremity of the instrument in that hole; and when the smoke has gone down, open the patient’s mouth at the extremity of the needle, and close the patient’s mouth so that the smoke is not blown out until you know that the smoke has reached the blood vessel, because the blood vessel must have fallen down.</start_of_turn
And if it does not fall, repeat the fumigation many times, and abstain the patient from drinking, and give them salty foods and drinks, and do not give them water, and if necessary, take them away from this regimen.</start_of_turn
This is the form of the instrument with which the blood vessel of the groin is treated when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps in this way, but it is in any curvature: ... ...which is similar to the groin, and the extremity of it is similar to the beak of a heron, which is hooked, in which it is grasped from five, so that when any cause is compressed, that does not slip away.</start_of_turn
Chapter XL.</start_of_turn
In which is the sum of the word in the opening of the abscesses and in the section of their.</start_of_turn
The abscesses are of various kinds, of various methods, as you remember from this book.</start_of_turn
And they are various in perforation and section of them by two methods, of which one is for the species of abscesses in themselves; and for what compresses of the humors.</start_of_turn
And the second method is for the places where the accidents of the body occur, for the abscess that happens in the head is different from the abscess that happens in the buttocks; and the abscess in the fleshy part happens differently from the abscess that happens in the joint; and each one of them must be treated differently.</start_of_turn
The wound should not be pierced except in the mature parts of the limb or as a consequence of it.
Other wounds which are crossed should be cut when mature, not according to their size, just like those which are proper for the joints, for an apostema which appears in a joint remains there until it is forced out; and if it is too strong, it corrupts the ligaments or nerves of that joint, because it is a cause of contraction of that limb; or if the apostema is that of a principal limb, and you delay the perforation of it until it is mature, it does not harm the principal limb; or if it is that of the heel, therefore perforate only when it is not mature; and do not perforate carelessly, except for the one which is proper for the heel, in order that you do not weaken the heel and that it is elongated towards the base of the heel, and that there is a fistula, or that it is healed in the end without being healthy. It is better that you know the time of perforation of the apostema, and that is when it is mature.
You know that it is mature when the pain and fever cease, and also the diminishing of redness and pulse, and the acuteness of the head of the apostema, and the other signs.
And you must know that the perforation must be made in the place where the apostema comes out and where its neck comes from.
The perforation should always be done along the length of the limb or the body, if the aposmata is in the parts of the feet or the legs, and in the place of the lacertices, of the cords of the nerves, of the arteries; and finally in all the places where there is no reflection; for in those where there is reflection, use perforation according to that limb.
When the aposmata is in a fleshy place, it is more convenient to delay the perforation until the digestion of the limb has been confirmed according to custom, as we have said; for if you perforate it before that, it prolongs the pain of the limb and its swelling, and it makes the lips of the limb stiff and deep
Other aposmata must be pierced according to the width of the limb or of the body as necessity requires, or as the limb itself demands.
And you must give a small perforation, and in large aposmata give great perforation or several sections according to the variety of the size of the aposmata.
And in other aposmata where the cord is concave and inflamed, when it is necessary because it is painful like bread and painful in the end that it should stay, just like that which happens in the groin of the buttocks and the armpits
And in those which are inscribed with three angles; and in those which are inscribed like the figure of a mirta leaf, like the aposmata of the ankle bones
And in those which are administered round section and lunar section, and which resemble these.
And in those which are not capable of such things like external aposmata, you must pierce only the superficial perforation, or only the flat one alone
And when the aposmata is large and has already collected much pus, that you pierce it and do not hesitate to extract all the pus at that moment; having extracted a part of it, immediately put the aposmata back into its place the next day, and the next day extract a greater part, and do this gradually until it is healed
And more if the illness is of cold origin, or of hot and cold, or a young child, or an old man in decrepitude, for the vital heat is resolved by the evacuation of the pus, and thus the illness is cured, and you must operate quickly.</end_of_turn>
Keep this chapter with great care, and take great care with your perforation in which you pierce these aposmata, because you must remove the humors and consider therefore if the humors of the aposmata are few or are flat, when you administer the which ones or the amount of them; and if the aposmata is large, and the tears of the perforation are many, you must pause for a moment until they settle down.</end_of_turn>
And if in the aposmata a part of the cord is detached or that you have concaved in the circuit, you must complex it with cloth or thread of silk, just like when you have treated bones or cartilage, its humidity; and strengthen that within the third day; and immediately after process that and care for it until the inflammation has disappeared.
And if blood flows out in the hour of your operation, immediately administer cold water and vinegar in which you have soaked a piece of cloth, and stop that over the area of the flow of blood until the bleeding has stopped.
May it be so that the flow of the sacred things persevere, for it is necessary that you administer regiment and care, and powders as I have recommended in many places of this present book and of division.
If it is wintertime, and the seat of the apostem is of nerves, then you must instill powders in wine and oil, and leave them on the area.</end_of_turn>
If it is summer, and the parts are fleshy, then you must leave powders in vinegar with oil or in wine and oil, and do so until the third day, as we have said, and you must remove the apostem and evacuate it, and administer to it the cure that is necessary for it until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And thus is what is necessary for the knowledge of the cure of apostemas universally, more so according to the way of distinction that I have already said of every apostem in what manner it is a way of the care of it by chapters singly.</end_of_turn>
Chapter LXI.</end_of_turn>
Of the section of apostemas which are in the codena of the head.</end_of_turn
In the small head there are small apostemas, and so of species of knots which contain tunics that are made for them; and the species of these are soft.</end_of_turn
And of these there are bubbles, and of those there are those that contain humidity similar to lime.</end_of_turn And of those there are those that contain humidity similar to urine, and resembling them; and of those that are waxy.</end_of_turn
And in the section of all, and in the extraction of these, there is no fear, as you must know the extension of these does not do harm to the arteries.</end_of_turn
And the operation in the section of these is that you remove them with an instrument of the kind that you see, which is called entromes, until you know that it contains.</end_of_turn
For if what is contained is humidity, then you must cut that apart by section according to the length by superficial section according to this manner:
And begin in the section of the line of B, entering into the line of G. For when the humidity is evacuated, then you must scrape that from which that humidity was contained, and do not leave from that any cause of all, for the troops that were fleeing return if they remain from that cause.</end_of_turn
And then you will immerse the wound in Egyptian unguents, if present, or in water and salt; and fill that with that the wound and leave that until the next day, for that which is eaten away corrodes all that remains of that membrane.</end_of_turn
And then you will repeat over that wound with Egyptian unguents according to the third and fourth if you command it, until you are confident that there is no remaining cause of that membrane; when the wound is cured with the unguents until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if the apostem contains fat nodes, then you must puncture that in this manner:</end_of_turn with a section having the shape of a cross, and take nails between two lips of the section and run that from end to end, and exert your virtue in extracting the tunic that contains that.</end_of_turn
However if your artery does you harm, then you must tell me that at once.</end_of_turn
Similarly you will do in the greasy apostem of section and care as we have said; and the section of the greasy apostem is less painful, for it is of little blood and little humidity.</end_of_turn
And many of these apostemas that are in the head in many homes with those whom there is no humidity; for the cause is that I do not know of an apostem in the head of an old woman who has not been bled, and I have seen that when it has been perforated, the apostem turns out like a white deaf stone, rough, white, which could not be drunk, and if any of you should wish to perforate that, you will cure that.</end_of_turn
However in other apostemas that happen in the head, another thing is not this chapter, namely as regards the apostemas that happen at the heads of children, you must take the reasons for the hangovers, however the section of these is superficial.</end_of_turn
And pause the perforation of those from the lower part of them so that the body of the illness is relieved in the lower parts.</end_of_turn
And then care for those with what is necessary for their care.</end_of_turn
Capitol .xlii.
Section of scrophulas which happen in the groin.
These veins are thickened in this area around the groin and in the buttocks and in the armpits; and some of them are thickened in other parts of the body.
And so those which happen in the groin, and those which are formed between them, and all the scrofula of these is without its own tunic, just like in the nodes and abscess of the head, just as we have recounted
And the species of these scrofulas are veins, which some of them are small stones, and some of them which contain moisture, and some of them are malignant which do not obey treatment
Therefore, in that place where you have a good opportunity in the touch, when the color of that which is manifested is proper to the color of codena, and it is bad for all, and it is not annexed to the nerves of the groin, neither to the veins, neither to the arteries, and it is not a swelling, because you should prick that which is just under the surface of the part from the part beyond the body from the line of G up to the line of B, and scrape that from all over, and stretch two lips of the codena towards both ends, or towards the nails if you need them, just as we have said in the abscesses of the head, and extract that little by little
And it is more cautious not to prick the vein or nerve.
And the sponge should not be too acute, that you do not damage your hand with the incision, or that you irritate the patient, and that you do not prick anything that is not necessary to prick; for if you prick the vein or artery you will prevent your operation, for the hours you stop the bleeding of the wound will be more plentiful of blood clots, and open the wound, and leave that which has stopped bleeding until the pain of the abscess has disappeared and the wound has become softer and the swelling has gone down. When the blood clot has been evacuated.<end_turn>
Therefore return to your operation when you have finished.<end_turn>
And in this way inquire whether there is any other small abscess, so prick them and wash them out.<end_turn
And if it is in the root of the large vein, cover that the hours you do not prick that abscess from its root. Always cover that with a faithful fold and that you leave that until it falls down by itself spontaneously.<end_turn>
And immediately fill the wound with old linen which you have already soaked in Egyptian balsam, and care for that.<end_turn>
And if you prick that abscess entirely, the hours cover that you adjust the two lips of the wound and compress so much pus that no blood remains superfluous.<end_turn>
More if there is still some surplus of blood due to the greatness of the abscess, cover that you understand how to prick the root of that, and remove that and administer suture and what is said.<end_turn
And that of the abscesses which contain moisture, prick that with a superficial perforation here where you see the maturity of them, and stop perforating from that which is below the belly, just as we have said.<end_turn><end_turn>
And immediately administer perforation, lukewarm in the water and similar to those, to prevent that which is remaining from the corruption.<end_turn><end_turn> And when the wound has already become soft, the hours you care for that which is generated in the water until it is healed.<end_turn><end_turn
Section .xliii.<end_turn>
Of the incision of the heel of the abscess which is without its own sac.
Say that the ancient doctors did this incision in the heel, and I do not know any man in our land who has ever had success with it.<end_turn><end_turn
This is the inscription of that sermon of them.
More in the women there is no slipping away, cover that the extraction of the heel is avoided, as for that it is not of any use for so much as all the veins and the major arteries of the patient are here.<end_turn><end_turn
More in those who have abscesses in the mouth or heel or two anklebones, when the disease is not in the bone, cover using the incision of the heel to escape the loss which is useful for perforation.<end_turn><end_turn
Therefore cover when you wish, that the wound bursts open and leaves three circles of the circles of the wound, or four at most for the width in that which there are two circles for quantity, that the section be in cartilage, not in the cartilage, and this place is suitable for section, for it is devoid of flesh and the vessels of sanctity are loosened from it.
If the doctor is cautious, cover when that the heel of the heel bone extends towards the ankle, and then cut the heel bone until it reaches the canal, but avoid the vessels of sanctity if you see any of these for any cause.
And then puncture according to what we have recommended; and it is significant to section the canal by the flame which is from that which arises from that which is broken and for the evacuation of the clot.
Leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore when the hour is ripe in which perforation is feared, add two layers of fat to the heel of the wound, and when only that remains of the cartilage
And then administer medicines that make the flesh vanish until it is healed.
And thus Albucasis says that the sum of the words we have recommended is not simply that you see that from these boils already postmortem the heel of the patient has become soft, and that the patient is dead, and that from him the flesh is separated, and these go to infect the epiglottis so that the patient can breathe over the wound every time he breathes, and is saved from death.
And thus I command that the wound be left open until the malice of the disease has passed; and the malice of it is for three days; and therefore I command that the wound be closed when it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And that which I have seen for my own business is that a servant brought a bowl and poured some medicine into the heel of the patient's foot and punctured in that place a part of the bone of the heel, and I was called to care for it, and I covered the wound with ointment just as it is done for a corpse, and I uncovered the wound and covered the flesh with the ointment which was on the wound itself little by little.</start_of_turn>
And thus I confessed that I had not pierced any veins or guided the needle, and that I had simply drained the wound, and cured that until it was healed.</start_of_turn
And I did not blame the servant if she did not understand, and I immediately returned to my duties.</start_of_turn
And now I say that in the section of the heel there is no fear.</start_of_turn
Chapter XLV.</start_of_turn>
Of section concerning the postmortem swelling which happens in the heel outside, and it is called hernia of the heel.</start_of_turn
This large swelling which is called hernia of the heel is large according to the colour of the body, and is not in the legs.</start_of_turn
And it is according to two methods, either it is natural or accidental.</start_of_turn
And in the natural one it is not a matter of cure.</start_of_turn
And the accidental one is according to two methods of which one is like grass knots, and the other method is like a swelling which is caused by the bursting of an artery, and in that one there is fear.</start_of_turn And do not cover that which makes presumption like iron except in the case that it is small.</start_of_turn And you should know that if you find it like grass knots, and it is not suspended from any vein, then you should puncture that just as if it were a node, and extract that which is contained in the skin and the membrane; and if not, the whole limb should be investigated to find the cause of the pain, and to provide proper care until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Chapter XLV.</start_of_turn
Of the section of the different kinds of knots.</start_of_turn
Of the knots there are many kinds, and I have already mentioned all the kinds in the division.</start_of_turn
And I cover that I recommend the difference between a node and an extrusion so that there is no doubt.</start_of_turn
Therefore I say that an extrusion is a fever and heat and severe pain until the swelling of the fluid subsides; and it is completed by decomposition when the time comes that the fever, the pain and the heat cease.</start_of_turn
The warmth of the node is neither heat nor cold nor pain, and it contains that yellow sac which is at the root of the disease.
It is according to the nature of the body, and its commencement is like cheese and is made like wax, whether greater or lesser, and they are of two kinds, either oily and containing moisture, or dry and containing fat, and the colors of moisture are muddy, as I have said in the division.</end_of_turn>
Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of the node, that you expel that which is called intumescence, according to its commencement which is at the root of the discomfort, as it will appear in the head which is nearby.</end_of_turn
It is a way of examining tumors and all nodes, that you take hold of this discomfort and bring that into the most humid place that you find in the tumor, and you will withdraw the fingers until you realize that the discomfort has already penetrated the cavity.</end_of_turn>
And finally put your hand according to the measure of the size of the tumor, and extract the tumor and consider what is left of it.</end_of_turn
And if the current moisture, whatever its color, has been discharged, then you will apply incision to the surface according to what I have said concerning other tumors.</end_of_turn
And if there is no moisture remaining from the intumescence, then you will know that it is fat.</end_of_turn>
And dry it over them with a blade having the shape of a cross according to this shape:</start_turn thus as I have taught you, and suspend that which is on nails, and scour the cavity thoroughly, and keep the skin or sac, if possible, over that and extract that marrow from the node.</start_turn>
However, if it is fractured in the operation, it is not possible to extract that marrow, and muddy spots are seen therein, and you will extract it piece by piece until no cause remains.</start_turn
For if there remains any cause, little or much, the node returns according to the most.</start_turn
And if sometimes some small part remains, then complete the wound with several sharp corrosive powders and stretch the wound, and rest over that which is the tumor caut, and care for the other treatment until it is healed.</start_turn
And if the node is large, then you will compress the two lips of the wound and care for that which is inside.</start_turn
However, if the pulse is contrary to it, or is not pulsating, then you will cover it and keep the place of the wound scraped with oil that is old and greasy for two days or for three until the wound has healed and the swelling has subsided; and finally you will return to cutting away whatever remains of the node.</start_turn
Chapter XLV.</start_turn>
Of the forms of the necessary discomfort in incision and perforation.</start_turn
Of those three kinds are the forms of the tumors, and of them some are great, and of them some are medium, and of them some are small.</start_turn
The form of the great tumor is like this:</start_turn
The form of the small tumor is like this:</start_turn
They are useful for iron, for alum, for fallen extremities suitably, so that they bind the intrament in the tumors.</start_turn
And these are the forms of the experts, and are known as barbers, and one of them is called barber.</start_turn
And of three kinds, of which one is great, one is medium, and one is small.</start_turn
The form of the great expert, form of him:
The form of the medium expert, form of him
The form of the small expert, form of him.</start_turn
I believe that these are for those tumors and exits and fistulas and abscesses so that between those there are bones and other causes.</start_turn
And so round, round, lions, like great needles with which the threads are sewn, and they are useful for alum, or for lead or iron, or silver, And the more they are of alum, the better.</start_turn

And of these, some have three curvatures, and there are three kinds

These are the forms of the scalpels with which the nodes and abscesses are cut and scorched, and there are three kinds, of which one is large, the other middle, and the other small.
The shape of a large scalpel
The shape of a middle scalpel
The shape of a small scalpel
The limbs of those on which the incision is made are acute, and the others are not acute, and are not interrupted in such a way, but rather because it is useful to assist in the excision of the nodes, for fear of injuring a vein or nerve, and for those it is healthy to the patient and provides tranquility in the reduction of the swelling which accompanies the excision of the abscess
These are the forms of helms, and there are three kinds: large, middle, and small, just like veyras.
They are useful for ears and resemble a ray on which there is an alcove.
And in the limb with the pierced point with hidden sponge and in that which runs to the parts downwards and upwards, when you wish, just like those you see
The forms of spatulas, which are hidden between the fingers of the hand must pierce the abscesses without causing harm, and there are three kinds: large, middle, and small These are the forms of those things:
The forms of winds with which the flow of blood is closed, and there are three kinds; large, middle, and small; the shapes of them are like this
They are useful for ears, circular with some length, and are subtle
And cover that these three kinds of winds must be used because they stop the flow of blood with speed, and in the beginning it is not medicine.
In no case must you apply these [cautery points] to all parts of the body, but only in fleshy places, thus as in the incisions of the thighs and buttocks, and in the incisions of the bones, nipples, belly, and genitals, resembling those in fleshy incisions huminous.
Many remedies are made from these small instruments resembling fish scales according to this fashion; for which the flesh is cut when it is deemed to be caused by inflammation, or incision of a vein or artery.</end_of_turn>
And these remedies are made round in this fashion:</end_of_turn

Some remedies swell the breasts of young men who have begun to grow, and when these swell the breasts, they become assembled like those of women, and remain so swollen afterwards, leaving them limp.</end_of_turn
And to the one who is suffering from this, command that he be incised with a crescent-shaped incision from the line of B to the line of G, and immediately excise the whole abscess, and place the plague of medicine intended, and adjust the two lips of the incision so that they lie close together, and care for the inside so that it becomes healthy.</end_of_turn
More so if the breast hangs downwards towards the lower parts and is softened by its magnitude as it happens with women, when it should be divided into two lateral sections as wide as necessary, at two lunar-shaped incisions, of which each contains the other at the end of each, until the greater line contains the smaller according to this fashion from the line of B to the line of G. And immediately excise the cord that is between the two lips of the plague, and stay the swelling, and administer what has been said about the suture and the patches that are necessary for the cure until it is healthy.</end_of_turn
And if you do not comply with the incision of that which you must make for the discomfort of the patient, and for the discharge of the abscess, then command that you drain the plague by submerging it in corrosive ointment and leave that which is left until the ointment has eaten away the fat, and care for that which is left until it is healthy.</end_of_turn

Of the perforation of abscesses that come from behind and irritate.</end_of_turn
These abscesses that come from behind and irritate are of the species of scrofulas, tough, which contain a sac.</end_of_turn
And of those there are some which contain moisture; and those which contain moisture must be incised with a crescent-shaped incision according to this figure: from the line of G to the line of B. And when everything has been evacuated from the abscess of the boil, then command that you close the wound with old cloth and leave it until the next day.</end_of_turn
And care for the wound both before and after with convenient ointment until it is healthy.</end_of_turn
And if the abscess is of the species of nodes, and of the scrophulas, then you must cut open that as we have said in the section about the scrophulas altogether.</end_of_turn
And if the plague is widespread in this way that it will not suffice to drain it, then command that you cauterize it according to what has been said above.</end_of_turn
End of Document</end_of_turn
Of the incision of abscesses which occur by artery or vein.</end_of_turn
When an artery is ruptured, and the cord which is above that is solidified, which is the cause of the abscess, it is known that inflammation and abscess are caused by the artery or vein: for when the abscess is caused by an artery, it is long aggregated in the belly of the body; and when it is caused by a vein, sit on it.
And that which is caused by a vein is round as the body manifests.</end_of_turn
And the incision of this abscess is wrong, especially in those who leave the heels, and the buttocks, and the groin, and in many parts of the body; and it is not great, therefore command that its cure by iron be avoided, and that which is in the extremities, or at the head, be avoided.</end_of_turn
More so if it is of the latter kind, cut into the cord section in the long; and immediately ligate the section with a clamp and hold the artery, and drain the tunicas until it is uncovered.</end_of_turn
And so do I place upon that needle and make it penetrate into the other side, and I establish the thread firmly doubled in two places, — which causes your eye to see clearly in extracting two threads which are in the temples.

And if it is a clot due to a vein being cut, then you must keep your hand there where the clot is at the root, and then insert the needle where you have left your hand, and make it penetrate; and double the thread in such a way that you can extract that which is in the other side, and then ligate the clot as much as necessary according to what I have told you about the ligate of the grape of two parts from two extremities of the thread.</end_of_turn>
Or if you fear that the thread will be torn, then insert the thread firmly with that needle leaving all the clot until the incision of the first needle, and strengthen the threads in four places.</end_of_turn
Then dry the clot in the middle of its place where it is when it is finished, and when it is dry, you will make an incision of the excess of the wound, and leave what is bound.</end_of_turn
And so do I place upon it the powder which you have soaked in wine and oil, and I give the care which is useful with warm compresses and heat until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter on the treatment of a clot caused by the twisting of nerves.</end_of_turn>
Likewise, when a clot occurs in an artery or a vein, and in the same way a clot occurs in nerves when it is affected by percussion or excessive work, and for the like.</end_of_turn
And it is more useful in the places of the assistants or the thigh, or in any place where stiffness of the joints is suspected.</end_of_turn
And the clot is difficult, and is like that of the other body, and is in the greatest part of its disposal when it is stretched violently, sitting in it the patient appears stunned.</end_of_turn
And it is not a clot that is added to the root of the body, and for so do you leave the wound open, and it is more painful throughout and does not go to the upper or lower parts.</end_of_turn
Therefore in those which are in the joints it does not suffice to apply iron, because great force must be exerted against contraction.</end_of_turn
And that which is in the head or in the front of the wound at the edge. And if it is a little clot, then you must bind it and remove that which is unnecessary.</end_of_turn
And if it is great, then you must suspend it with a bandage, and extract that, and then keep that; and close the wound with sutures, and care for that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter end.</end_of_turn>
Of the cutting of a clot that occurs from the heel that occurs in the belly.</end_of_turn
Until to the buttocks of those who are seated among those who are watching from the belly of those who are present who are infected with fungal diseases similar to those of the fungi, of which the root is subtle and the head of which is large; and already the lips of those are soft, and it is of those that is small, and is not majestic.</end_of_turn
And I have already seen one, and in the belly of it were two companions who were more like fungi resembling each other, and there was no difference between the white ones, of small root.</end_of_turn
And already the lips of those were ulcerated and bled, and moisture ran from it all the time.</end_of_turn
Therefore I recommend that you apply it on one side of the foot where the pain is.</end_of_turn and the other side of the foot where there is pain.</end_of_turn
And the operation in the incision of them is that you consider if the patient is sweating, and if the color of the patient’s nails is white, sweating, of subtle root; then you must puncture the side of the foot with the needle, and if in your presence there is a cautery in the fire, that the spotted matter must be expelled without causing harm; and if you see that the patient is sweating, burn that.</end_of_turn
If sometimes the patient is pale and fearful, keep him calm by reminding him that the recent pain has passed and that the ailment is not serious; the manner of which is that which we have mentioned; and let him rest for two days.
And so adjust the tension of the flesh of the palm; therefore, do not cease to press the great toe until it is split and falls off by itself when the work is done
And if it is of great reason, the hour at the beginning of the illness is a cause of fear and anxiety, especially in those who are in the belly
Perhaps you will split the mass of the foot, and then cauterize that so that it does not return
And so care for that until the wound is healed.
And keep in mind that you do not presume to split that which is of fatty color, of little sensation, with regard to the leg, because that which is abscess is rotten.
And I remind you of the wound nearby.

Praise be to the care of the Most High of the navel.
The navel is useful for many causes; or for fractures of the ribs which are above the belly, and yeys of them the cloth or the intestine according as it happens in other ruptures; or for healing which flows from veins or arteries as it is said above, or for cramps caused by excessive wind in the belly.
And if it is for a fracture of the ribs and for yanking of the cloth, the hour the color of the urine is similar to the color of the body; and is like a lion when it is in pain, and appears in various positions And if it is for the escape of the intestine, the hour its situation is that which we have recounted, of may be of various kinds, and as you have said that which is hidden from us is occultated, and so return; and it is strong in that place, and is increased by many blows of the hand and violent work
And if it is for moisture, the hour is like a lion and is not occultated when we put our hand on it, nor is it constricted, nor is it painful.
And if it is for healing, the hour this symptom disappears the urine appears dark and declining
And if it is for meat nothing, the hour is dark urine, thick and harsh, and remains according to a quantity
And if it is for wind, the hour it touches them is like a lion
And the operation in them is that you consider the hour if the navel is for the healing of an artery or a vein or for wind; the hour forbids you to take care of it, because in that case there is fear and anxiety just as we have taught you in the chapter where we said that the urine is for an artery and a vein.
And if the navel is for the intestine or for the cloth, the hour commands the patient who has the pain to sit still and be relaxed; and command him to lie down on the navel; and command him to put two hands over the patient’s legs and two hands over the patient’s chest; and command him to extend the palm of the hand over the place where you have marked with your finger; and command him to grasp the great toe firmly or weakly and with a gentle touch
And so hold the heel of the palm extended over the ligament and insert the tip of the finger into that place and ask for the intestine; and if you have found it neither grasped nor preserved for the ligament, the hour you will extract the intestine and expel the intestine to the parts under the belly
And if you have found the cloth, the hour take that one with your hand; and cut away the excess of it.
And if it is contrary to your artery or vein, the hour surrounds that thing, and then return to your operation; and take two needles and put them in those two strong fields and insert two needles into the circuit which you have made around the urine in the manner of a cross, which you will pierce; and then strengthen the urine in four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, keep the needles and rest the place until the meat extends and falls off by itself; or cut that when it is subtle and it falls down, and so care for that which covers the wounds until it is healed.
And if the navel is for meat nothing in it or for moisture, the hour commands you to uncover the urine just as we have said and extract the meat or the moisture which you find in it, and so care for that which covers and consolidates the place.

We have already said, in the division, concerning the species of cramps and how they are to be treated with medicines, and that it is dangerous to treat them with iron so that they are not ulcerated; and we have said that cramps are caused by excess and the care of their treatment.
And the old people say that some cramps can be cured only in their place where it is possible to eradicate them, thus as for cramps which are in the armpits or in the groin and similar to those which are in the limbs, it is better to remove all of them, especially when they are beginning small.
More when it is ancient and is strong, do not dare to touch it, for I do not know that I can heal either this or any other, or that it has ever been healed by anyone.
And the operation for it is when it is necessary, as we have said, that you precede the patient and evacuate from the black bile several herbs, and then anoint that area, if it is found to be painful, with ointment.
And prepare the patient for the operation in the preparation in which it is located, and prohibit in the tract a few nails which cover that; and press all around the abdomen so that no cause of the cause of the cramps remains And let the blood flow, and do not tear away that which is urgently, express the boils, and wipe off the blood with your hand or with an instrument.
More if at your hand should arise contrary to great bleeding from a vein or from an artery, then cauterize that until the flow of blood is stopped, and then care for that as for the other care until it is healed
Capital letter LIV.
From the care of hydrophobia.
We have already mentioned, in the division, concerning the species of hydrophobia of water, and we have told you of the care of each of them with medicines
And that which is cured with iron is only the species of althitas alone, and it is not approached with iron to the species of timpanists or to the species of yposarcha, for that is deadly
And when you have already treated this species of hydrophobia of the timpanist with medicines and you do not perceive your medicine, then consider that if the patient has already achieved abstinence, or is suffering from another disease, just as if it were in his throat or in his belly and resembling those, do not give him iron, for fear of that.
More if sometimes the patient vomits excessively, and it is only hydrophobia alone, and not a child or an old man, then the manner of the operation for it is that you place the patient between your thighs, and express his belly with your hand, fill the water to the part beyond the fifth, and take sponge thorns in this way:
both in two sharp parts long, with the sharp end towards the sponge; more however even if in the course of the operation some should pass into the intestine, you must lead that away.</start_turn>
And consider if the generation of hydrophobia is from the bowels, for in that case you must with the incision remove three inches from the belly below the navel
More if the generation of hydrophobia is from disease of the spleen, then your incision must be to the left of the navel for three inches.
And if the generation is from the liver, then your incision is in the flanks
And do not let your incision be over the side on which the patient wants to vomit, for it will cause the blood to flow there carelessly.</start_turn
And pierce with the instrument all the way through the belly, and enter in that incision, and raise your hand with the sponge between the belly and the skin, and you will expel that; and if the amount of an inch or two.
And pierce the spleen until the sponge reaches the place where the water is.</start_turn And extract that and insert an instrument of this kind: and it is similar to a silver cannula; it is made of silver or of ivory or of lead, to which there is a small hole at the lower end, and on the sides there are three holes: two from one side and one from the other side; and the end is blunt according to the manner of a feather, as sometimes.</start_turn

Keep this in mind during your surgery, for blood clots can occur during the procedure; pause the operation when you see them separating the blood vessels, and care for the wound until it has healed.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</start_of_turn>
If there is swelling in the scrotum at the root of the testicles, varicocele, hernia and adhesion of the testicles to the root of the scrotum.</start_of_turn
These veins that are causing the swelling in the scrotum are a sign of impending rupture of the testicles.</start_of_turn
One of them is malignant and the other is not.</start_of_turn
Not malignant, for if you suspend it with a clamp and remove it when the swelling has gone down; and place another over that part that is submerged in Egyptian unguent; and do so until that also is cured.</start_of_turn
If the swelling is malignant, dark in color, then you must administer cautery immediately at the root of the testicles and in the proportion of the testicles.</start_of_turn
If the swelling is in the prepuce at the root of the testicles, not circumcised, and half of the swelling is inside the prepuce and the other half is outside, then you must keep the swelling which is inside until it is solidified; and when you have cured that which is outside, for when you have cured that the prepuce will not be torn.</start_of_turn
And already there are seen to occur swellings in the groin and in the prepuce, black and rough, where you must conquer all that is already blackened and that is about to burst or that is already burst; and for this you must apply oil over that which is soft, which is composed of millet flour and poppy seeds and lead.
And care for that until the other cure is finished so that it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if there is blood flow in the wound, then administer lunar cautery in this way:
because the cautery needle is useful for both clotting blood and for cleaning the wound when it is corrupted.</start_of_turn>
And if the head of the testicles is corrupted and is destroyed at the same time, then you must insert into the meat of the prepuce a a plum catheter so that the patient can urinate for that.</start_of_turn
In the adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the testicles (and this adhesion does not occur except in the case in which the prepuce is soft, and over it no circumcision is required; and when it occurs by wound or swelling) you must excise with blunt forceps until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the testicles is freed entirely.</start_of_turn
And if it is difficult to grasp them, you must excise with blunt forceps all around the head of the testicles and the prepuce, and know that when the prepuce is soft, firm as it is perforated by its softness.
And put between the prepuce and the head of the testicles a piece of lint, which is already wet in the cold water so that it does not adhere to another vein.</start_of_turn
And care for it with vinegar until it is solidified.</start_of_turn
End of text.</start_of_turn
Of the castration of children and the care of what occurs in those who undergo circumcision.</start_of_turn
Circumcision is not a solution to continuality just like any other wound: however, even if it is our operation and our will, and because of that it is properly done in children, it is necessary that we assign in that better operation and way less suffering for the loss of life.</start_of_turn
Therefore I say that the ancients did not ordain circumcision in any of their laws, because they did not use it, and it is only because we have learned through experience that the greatest part of physicians and barbers use to circumcise and castrate with new instruments and with nails; and they use thread and sting.
And I have already proved all these methods and I do not find a better mutilation than that with forceps, thread and needle that when it is done to the testicles the codena escapes more easily, for the cord of the prepuce is split into two tunics, and the tension is left behind, and it is strong enough to force another incision and pain without doubt.</start_of_turn And as for the castration which is useful for almsgiving and is digital, which is what the tailors use, it is not followed by the incision of the extremity of the virile member, for it is strong enough to enter the cavity of it.</start_of_turn
More on the operation, let me observe further, for you are corrupting the work. And the cord of the child is short by nature, and many times it does not require modification, and I have seen such a case.</end_of_turn>
More on the modification that you make with the forceps and sutures, I have learned from experience that excessive force should not be used, for when the force is too great, the sensation that remains is just as great; and therefore, as you promised your hand, I shall now proceed with the incision according to a comparison at a suitable time; and it is enough to compress the suture with the shape that contains the cord of the fetus from the start to the end, without causing any error.</end_of_turn>
And the manner of the first operation is that you must take the child out mainly if he is of those that I understand to be small, do not take out the cord but simply tie the suture in its groove alone, and that you watch for that which enters on the other side the next day.</end_of_turn
And indeed do so in such a way as is possible for you to receive her intelligence.</end_of_turn> And indeed do so in such a way as to make your hands appear more statuesque prepared in advance, and do not be seen to be clumsy; and hide the forceps in your hand or leave them at your feet, so that the child does not see them or any other instruments.</end_of_turn
And indeed do so by placing your hand on the belly and blowing in the cord, and pulling that which enters until it comes out from the head of the cord, and then modify that which is added to it from the beginning.</end_of_turn
The way of the forceps for modification is as follows:
The outer handles are non-taloned, and the inner handles are taloned, so that it does not irritate the flesh of the thumb, and the length of the two acute angles is as great as the length of two thumbs together.</end_of_turn
More, the error in modification is that if you force too much you will expel the intrinsic cord entirely, or part of it from the incision.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must extend that of your hour at your nail before the apostematization of the place and that you make the incision according to equality.</end_of_turn
And if you cannot hold it at your nail, then extract it with your hand and make the incision again.</end_of_turn
More, if three days have passed and the cord remains flat from the outset, then you must watch until the apostemata of the cord has subsided, and then extract that which remains easily, and make the incision as you are prepared.</end_of_turn
And take care of the head of the cord, so that it does not come to it.</end_of_turn
And therefore care for that which concerns the consolidation of the powders which we have recommended in the treatise of powders.</end_of_turn>
And if it is necessary to make an incision of the cord beyond measure, and you obey the parts above, do not notice it to them.</end_of_turn
And indeed do so with that which we have said until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter 58.</end_of_turn>
Of the care of retained urine in the bladder.</end_of_turn>
Retained urine in the bladder is caused by excessive population, for stone or for sand, or for poverty or for meat, and it remains like those which we have said concerning the methods of care in the division.</end_of_turn
And if it is not dissolved in water that we have said, harsh is the cause of the disease, the hour that we must administer extraction from it with an instrument that is called a syringe, which is like this: of silver or of lead hammered, like a nail with a round head, to which be added a tube of lead with a length equal to that of a palm and a half, to which be added a little bit of lead at the head.</end_of_turn>
And the method of extracting the urine for that is that you take the bladder fold and bind it at the root of the bladder; and you bring out the bladder from the belly through the flank of the loin, and prick with the forceps if there is any hardness remaining, more especially if you insert the finger into the tube with force.
And do the patient rest on the bench, and cover the bladder with a cloth and vinegar with olive oil and vinegar.
And immediately insert the bladder through ease until it reaches the level of the navel; and then bend the navel downwards to the part of the abdomen; and then bring down the bladder along with it; and then bring down the bladder until it reaches the bladder, and the patient is relieved of the pain, and that is not useful according to this order, but the meat in which there is torpidity.</end_of_turn>
And gradually pull out the bladder with the thread, so that the urine follows the thread.</end_of_turn>
And extract it and do urinary care, and use the bladder, do not leave it until the bladder is evacuated and the pain is relieved.</end_of_turn>
End of document.</end_of_turn>
What is the quality of the bladder catheterization from this time on, and what instruments will be in agreement with the water?</end_of_turn
When there is an ulcer or swelling in the bladder, or it is congested with gravel, or it is contracted due to pain, and you wish to drain urine and medicines, the hour is to use a clamp catheter, which is like this:
But if in the extraction of the liquid it is deaf, so it is closed.</end_of_turn And in this there are three tracts: two of one side, like when it is repeated.</end_of_turn
At the beginning is the liquid with the sediment, and is as much as the quantity that covers that, until when any cause is overcome from that, it is thrown away, and when it is expelled, with that it is thrown away, and when it is expelled long, according to the quantity of the clamp catheter that is placed in the battles of the sea.</end_of_turn
Therefore if you wish to expel humors from the bladder, insert the extremity of the clamp catheter into the humidity, and pull out that liquid that is deposited in the parts above, because the humidity is expelled in the curvature of the clamp catheter.</end_of_turn
And immediately insert the extremity of the clamp catheter into the navel according to what we have recommended in the bladder; and then bring down the humidity with the water, because that humidity returns to the bladder at the same time, and the pain is relieved at that.</end_of_turn
Shape of the subtle crystallization of the bladder, which is this:</start_turn
And it is useful either of silver or lead, of which the head is like a small pen, and is held by a thread.</start_turn
And immediately grasp the bladder from its movement, and stop in that place the humidity that you wish to crystallize in the bladder, and then tie that between two with a strong thread doubled, and scald that humidity over the fire.</start_turn
And immediately insert the extremity of the crystallization into the navel.</start_turn
And immediately place your hand over the bladder with the humidity at a stretch until the pain is relieved that that humidity has already reached the bladder.</start_turn
And if your bladder is not present, the hour is to take a bundle of wool and make of that circle; and pierce that through all its roundness; and immediately insert the strong thread into those veins, even if they are revolting; and immediately add the circle so that it is added to the sponge, because you rest in that water that you wish to expel humors from, and oil and vinegar.</start_turn
And immediately tie that in the instrument and do like you did with the bladder, and express with your hand until the humidity reaches the bladder.</start_turn

The stone is slippery and difficult to grasp, for its angles and margins are sharp.
And thus it is like a lion’s claw, round and it is slippery from its smoothness.</end_of_turn>
Therefore, if it is the one whose angles and margins are like this, adjust it in the fissure.</end_of_turn>
And if it is not like this, then cover what is above it with your hand, or grasp firmly what is below it adequately, the limb which is like this with a lime, and do not neglect it; or that you enter and leave behind the instruments of curved limb.</end_of_turn>
Or if you do not see that, increase the wound a little, and if you see discharge of pus, cut off the infected part that is causing it.</end_of_turn
Or if the stone is bigger than one, then at the beginning of the operation you grasp the hand to the mouth of the bladder, and then you prick it there; and then grasp a little of the stone.  Like this do if there are several stones of greater size.</end_of_turn
And if the stone is large, it is ignorant to insert it into that great cavity, because it causes to the patient two evils: either that it remains there or that it causes continuous discharge of urine, for which reason the limb is not completely consolidated.</end_of_turn
Or administer expulsion of it as soon as it is possible, or make an opening in the fracture of the limb with forceps, and extract that in pieces.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe leaves and dragon's blood, and grasp that.</end_of_turn And rest on that limb soaked in oil and wine, or in scented oil and warm water, so that the burn becomes softened.</end_of_turn
And provide the patient with rest on the bed, and do not remove the dressing until the third day.</end_of_turn>
And when that has gone, bathe the limb with water and a little oil, and care for it with ointment and balsam until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Or if in the wound there is remaining a burn, stick to it and do not remove it, and if it appears like the urine is frozen in the bladder, that is to say that it is the prohibited urine (and that is known for the emission of the urine with blood), then enter the gut said in the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains it will cause the bladder to corrupt and putrefy.</end_of_turn
And finally wash the wound with vinegar, water and salt, and against all spices, against anything that could impede its healing until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And keep throughout all the care that you lie both thighs together and adjust the medicines that are placed over the limb.</end_of_turn
And if the stone is small and is in the meat of the marrow, and is fixed in it, and there is no discharge of urine, then care for that as follows: since this cure is recommended only when it is necessary, because it is reproved for this treatment, and indeed I have seen it condemned for this care.

On the surgery of an abdominal hernia.</end_of_turn
An inguinal hernia is nothing but the accumulation of moisture in the white sac which contains the intestines and is called a sac.
There are several veins in the proper bowel which nature has prepared in the part of the intestines, until it is complete; and that is the cord of the genetius between the white sac which we have mentioned, and it is not water but bile.</end_of_turn
The cause of this hernia is by excessive pressure on the genetius, because at those it is infiltrated by this matter, and sometimes it happens by a violent blow that is done on the genetius.</end_of_turn
This moisture has various colors, because its color is declining to yellow or bloody, or sometimes it is black and feculent, or it is white and watery, and that is the best.</end_of_turn
The signs by which it is known that this accumulation of liquid is in the white sac that we have mentioned, are that when it is pressed it is slightly rounded down in length as if it were a ball of water, and the genetius appears, because the liquid contains all around it.</end_of_turn
If the liquid is in the proper bowel, then when it is pressed it is rounded down towards the part of the intestine and by this it is believed that it is another portion of intestine.</end_of_turn
If the liquid is between the cord of the genetius and the white sac, then leave it alone.</end_of_turn
And when you want to know the color of the liquid, then express the color of the liquid from the swelling by cutting a piece of the substance which precedes the swelling; and according to what comes out in the residue, judge of what is contained in it.</end_of_turn
Therefore when we come to the treatment of it, we must command the patient to abstain from eating if that is possible, and sometimes to lie down.</end_of_turn
And make them rest on two pillows on any cause a little high, and stop them from moving around.</end_of_turn
And sit down on the left side of them, and command the servant to follow on the right side of them, who will extend his thumb from two fingers to the cord of the genetius and the part of the navel of the belly.</end_of_turn
And take hold of the thumb and split the cord of the genetius from the middle part of the limb to the length almost to the fifth finger.</end>
And make the incision according to the rule at an equal distance from the line that should be drawn over the skin of the genetius, until it reaches the white sac including.</end_of_turn>
And evacuate that, and observe, and keep me informed so that I do not cut that; and your evacuation with which you evacuate that part should be suspended with the greater and subtler humors and written on the skin according to the amount that is possible for you.</end_of_turn
And then pierce the full sack with a wide perforation, and extract all the liquid.</end_of_turn
And then separate between two layers of the incision with scissors, and stretch the sac downwards; do not touch the cord of the genetius including, and close the sac in that manner that is possible for you.</end_of_turn And pierce the whole or in parts, and especially let it be with a needle, because if you do not precisely pierce the area, it is not safe that the water does not return.
Even if there proceeds from that area beyond the hip in the hour of your operation, when you have completed the incision of the sac, return the gut, and then adjust the two flaps of the hip towards the genitals with sutures, and take care of this just as with the other wounds, until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if you find the gut corrupted by another disease, then know that you must ligate the vessels which are sore the suspenders, and extract the gut, and take care of this as we have said.</end_of_turn>
And if the water is added in two parts it is sufficient; therefore pierce that part as much as you did in the other swelling; and if you are of the opinion that it is an operation, then do it.</end_of_turn
And then withdraw the blood, and enter into the sections of the fatty substance submerged in oil or in scented oil; and place another layer of fat which you have submerged in wine and oil over two genitals and the belly; and place over that a bandage which you have doubled and powdered, and ligate those over like this:</end_of_turn
and take two cloths and fill them with coarse wool according to this shape; and ligate the extremities which are between the knee or the wet wool, and join them together in the groin of the thighs, and one of the extremities extends to the belly button within two fingers, and the other extends to the loin, and two extremities over two toes and two others over two fingers, and join all the restrictions in the groin of the thighs.</end_of_turn
And many hernias of this kind are medicated artificially with cautery in place of incision with iron; and it is that you take pointed cautery and pierce that area of the hip, and it is ignited as we have recommended until the white sac containing the water is discovered, and then you take the cautery as we have said.</end_of_turn and is assembled in Greek letters.</end_of_turn>
And pierce that sac, and it is ignited until all the moisture is expelled.</end_of_turn
And stretch out the sac with fingers, and evacuate it with fingers, and evacuate with pointed cautery ignited; and pierce that according to what is possible until you have eradicated everything; and take care that the fire does not touch you.</end_of_turn
And know that this operation is more saving and more lasting than an incision.</end_of_turn
And if during the incision or the cautery or the flux of blood there is opposition, know that you must take care of whatever opposition is done to you for that reason, with the care that you are accustomed to give to them.</end_of_turn
And if the disease is slight, and you do not expect the second operation because of its horror, know that you must administer the perforation as we have recommended; and it is when it is certified that you must, for the things we have said about the significance, that that hernia is harmless.</end_of_turn
Know that you must place the patient above any elevated area, and pierce the apostema in the lower part of it at the waist, and stop the perforation according to the length of the body.</end_of_turn
And let the incision be wide enough to drain out all the water.</end_of_turn
And then place over the area the knee and ligate that and leave that, so that the water remains there.</end_of_turn And take care of that until the wound is healed.</end>
And if there is opposition when the water comes out in that hour you perforate that: and the water is not useful except for the fact that the white membrane in the orifice of the wound prevents the escape of the water, know that you must put in the wound a little or some instrument with which to extract the water from the abscess, the form of which is preceded; or adjust in the oppression of the wound a little piece of sponge.
And know that the water returns, and is added again with wine in a few months or in February; and when it is added, pierce that according to that custom, for the disease will also pass those seven days.</end_of_turn

Of incision concerning the cartilaginous hernia and its care.</end_of_turn>
Sapias that in this section concerning this hernia there is fear of loss of consciousness in the greater arrangements; for I see the dismissal of them and their preservation for that better.
And I remember the operation in that case and the species of the apostemas.</end_of_turn>
Therefore, I say that apostemas arise in the testicles of those who have them composed and that it is caused by various causes: or by sudden excessive moisture which is spread to the testicles, or by impact.</end_of_turn>
The color of the apostema is according to the color of the testicles, and it is not found in pain, and is a hard apostema.</end_of_turn
And a soft apostema is often seen, of which the color is dark, and is not firm to the touch.</end_of_turn
And certain herbs are useful for the swelling of the arteries, and for the inflammation of those veins which are already perceived, or for the inflammation of veins.</end_of_turn
Moreover, that which is for the inflammation of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the apostema when you compress that which is between the testicles; and do not touch that.</end_of_turn
Moreover, that which is useful for the inflammation of the veins is not dispersed by any cause due to compression of those.</end_of_turn>
And it is already possible that in this species it is useful to make an incision and over the others meats; and that you insert the needle of the testicles, and then stretch the skin downwards, and extract that from the white sack, and deliver the sperm of the vessels, and link them, and insert more sperm than you deliver from all parts of the skin.</end_of_turn
Therefore if the testicles are already solidified in those meats, then cover that you extract the testicles and insert that.</end_of_turn
And if there is adhesion between any cause of the sack, or between those which are between the veins, then cover that you deliver all that adhesion and insert that by incision around.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if it is born from meat in the place of the adhesion which is behind, then cover that you insert all that which is of it, and extract the testicles as we have said.</end_of_turn
Therefore when your operation is completed, then fill the wound with soft wool soaked in olive oil and vinegar; and take care of that as soon as the other care is completed until it is healed.</end_of_turn

However we must say the operation in which the first appears.</end_of_turn
I say that one should make the patient lie on a high cushion; and then insert the sperm of the testicles to the lower parts; and take hold of the testicles with the hands that are to be verified; and have those other ministers that you have, and extend those with violent extension.</end_of_turn
And immediately insert with a blunt knife a transverse incision through the sack of the vessels until the vessels are revealed.</end_of_turn
And immediately extract all that we have said in the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.</end_of_turn
And leave in those a needle which is doubled over, and link that at the first place where it happened, and link that other herb at the end of them.</end_of_turn And immediately insert those at the middle of the belly for transverse incision according to the length of the body, and extract what is added of the foul and corrupt humors.</end_of_turn
And take care of the wound with the care of the other wounds in which you wish to be cured so that the vessels which support one of the two testicles are not injured, which is not bad for that.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if all the veins are injured, then cover that the testicles are extracted or that the testicles because of the vessels are crushed, for that is private of all nourishment for the nourishment of the veins, and that they are established, or that they are crushed so that they are not useful with those.</end_of_turn

The origin of this hernia is by incision that extends over the abdomen from the flanks of the navel, so that the intestines coming from the rupture are intermingled with the abdominal fat.
Or this rupture is of the bladder or of excess of gas, and these two things happen for various causes: either by percussion, or by swallowing, or by straining, or by elevation of any serious cause, or by remaining in a sitting position for a long time
The sign of this is that if it is an extension of the bladder, it happens slowly over a long time, and does not happen abruptly, and the edema subsides within a few days without any treatment.
The sign of this is that if it is an incision of the bladder, at the beginning it causes severe pain immediately; and it is edema that makes the belly appear swollen, and this is because of the displacement of the intestine by the tumor of the bladder against the walls of the abdomen
Therefore every physician must know how to treat this hernia of the intestines immediately, because it is an urgent thing that must not be delayed
Some physicians are of the opinion that the cause of this hernia is excessive wind, others that it is caused by a wound in the intestine, and here it is retained, and it is in this way that it causes great suffering, and other physicians say that it is caused by violent vomiting and mostly when it is accompanied by pain
And in the treatment of this disease there is fear, for that one must fear that it will escape from the physician's grasp in that moment.
The way of operating in this case is that you command the patient to reduce the swelling of the belly with their hand to the extent that they can bear, and if they obey your order, then put a wet compress over the area between their thighs and hold their legs up.
And then close the opening which is between the testicles and the skin, and suture the opening of the testicles all the way through; and at the end of the suture close the two lips of the incision as much as you wish to open the incision with those things
And if the opening is large as you are able, that from that one must not forget the dressing of the wound
And immediately remove from that area the phlegmas which are left in the opening of the testicles, until the white hard membrane of some part is discovered.
Then you must empty the intestine called in this case testicles, between the white membrane which is left in the opening of the intestines, which is left in the opening of the wound, and the membrane which is between them, and remove from that the adhesion which is in the back of the wound
And finally put your hand over the opening of the testicles at the edges, and with your left hand extend the white membrane towards your hand, and elevate the intestine with the membrane towards the incision; and command the assistant to extend the intestine outwards and you dissolve the adhesion that is behind with a solution accomplished
And seek that there be no cause for the swelling of the belly covered with the white hard membrane. Maybe you will find some cause of this in the belly that you left behind
And finally insert inside the opening of the testicles for the incision of which we have spoken, so that there runs blood and air out of it as we have recommended above
And give a soaked bandage in oil, and wait on the wound; and administer the thread which we have recommended (and several physicians cauterize the white membrane of the abdomen, which we have mentioned above in order to prevent the flow of blood, because many physicians say that these happen in those).
May it be that despite the delay of the case, the hour of cold water is opportune, and pause until it falls as we have said.
And thus treat the plague with the other care of the plagues until it is healed
Chapter 66
Of windy hernia
In this hernia nothing has been observed that has been omitted in its care
And first say that it is useful in this hernia as we have recommended in the other hernia that is in the vein; that you ligate the vessels near the section where it is necessary to facilitate them; and dry in the midst of the place around the abscess with water until the vessels fall.
Care for the plague as we have said until it is healed
Chapter 67
Of the dislocation that is useful in the ankle bones
Some veins outside break in the ankles as we have said, and examine the place
And do not cause the geneuses any cause of the bulges to the geneuses; and if you cause them, it is little; and return in all hours
May it be that despite the prolonged time of the water, an adjusted fracture is made in the tibia until the bubble disappears in the tibia; and do this because of the extension of the tibia which is in the ankles as we have said, which cause is that the tibia is stretched, and therefore it is softened and the place is apostematized and examined
And the care of it is like that which precedes the narration.
And many wounds are cured with iron according to this manner: the patient lies over the seat of two between his thighs, and dry the place of the rupture of the abscesses examined with a section for the breadth according to the quantity of three fingers
And dry the white tibia that is under the knee until it is discovered
And take the ray and stop it on the prominent part of the tibia, and press that against the navel
And press the two prominent parts over the extremity of the tibia, and suture one of them to the other
And extract the extremity of the tibia, and do not insert the tibia from the heel, nor extend the heel, nor any other cause like that which I tell you in the care of intestinal hernia
And care for it like the care of the plagues, and when it has been inserted, soften it and restore the wound until it is consolidated; for the tibia is contracted and the prominence of the rupture is not adjusted
And it is better in this place, for it is more likely to recover
Chapter 68
Of the softening of the knee of the testicles
Many wounds the knee of the testicles in various houses are softened to help soften the flesh that is between them, and feed it accordingly
When necessary it is necessary that the patient sits according to the seat of two, and dissect the whole knee which is softened over the natural knee; and then suture two lips together
Or if you wish, when you commence to soften the knee with three sutures or four and a firm suture
And insert between the sutures; and care for the care of the other wounds until they are healed and the wounds fall off
Chapter 69
Of castration
Wisdoms that castration is prohibited in our law, however I remember it in this book; and it is not necessary to recall it except for two cases, of which one is that the physician should know the care of it when it is questioned about it, since he knows the care of it to which it corresponds; and the other case is that we must sometimes castrate other animals for our judgments for those, as well as mares, and sows, and goats, and for such like beasts.
And therefore I say that castration is useful in two ways: or by traction, or by incision at section
May be in that which is causing the pain, the way of the work is that we must make them cease the beast in cold water until the veins of them become softened and limp and that they hang down. And immediately take hold of them with your hand so that they do not appear to touch them again
May be in castration there is pain for fracture and section, cover that you have the beast and press the testicles of them with your left hand
And immediately bind the supporters, and pierce concerning any humor on a section until two humors proceed.
And immediately pierce those which have been scorched And do not let them be about those of the hips any cause, but the subtle hip which is above the veins
And this manner of castration is better than that which is for attrition, because attrition strong would leave any cause of the testicles so that the beast would desire to bite
And immediately care for the plague until it is healed

On the care of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men is according to two methods: the one is when it appears that the space between the testicles is cut off in that place where between two testicles appears what looks like a woman in which one can insert.
And many women of that age urinate in the space between the testicles
And in women it is a kind: and it is that the known woman about the fifth is like two testicles of a man a little big and a little small at the end like two testicles of a man and two testicles
And the care is of three kinds: two of the men and one of the women And it is that you put your hands on those parts that are adjusted until you drive out the sign of that, and immediately care for those with care for the other diseases
And in the second kind of the men of whom we have spoken who urinate in the space between the testicles, there is no care or operation in them
End of treatise
On the limping and the prominent belly in women.
Strong limping is adjusted for natural causes until it is relaxed and is done without regard; and many women experience swelling in various parts as much as in men and even during coitus
Therefore take hold of the excess of limping with your hand or with an instrument and pierce it
And do not hesitate in incision, especially in the groin, so that there should be no discharge of urine.
And immediately care for that which is with care for the diseases until it is healed
May be no new flesh is flesh that is not in the horror of the mother until it fills that, and strong is expelled from the parts at the end like a coat (and for this reason the first callers call it “caudal disease”); therefore take hold of it like that which is taken of limping and care for that until it is healed
End of treatise
On the care of the ulcer
The ulcer is that which does not pierce the known woman, or that which has a small hole It is either natural or accidental
Accidental is by disease which has preceded, and that which is done or for no adjusted flesh or for subtle or thick fat
It is either in the groin or in the belly, or on the sides, or on the belly of it, or on the buttocks, and prohibits lying down and standing up and sitting down, and strong urine prohibits menstruation
And the knowledge of that is profitable for regarding the uterus, if the swelling is apparent, it is recommended; but if it is not apparent, the hour you seek that which is in the belly or in the ribs.
And if the swelling is for subtle fat, and is recommended to the two lips, the hour you touch and break that
And so you should place your hand over the two lips and indicate with your tongue that they are indeed cold.
And the woman should place her feet upon the two heels, the heels spread wide, and then stretch the two lips as forcefully as necessary until that soft bag is ruptured and the fluid is opened
Then take wool and soak it in oil and place it upon the area, and keep it there until the area is healed so that it does not solidify
If the bag is large and full, it is necessary to cover it with some soft cotton wool or a leaf of myrtle
If the fluid is bloody, suspend the bleeding for a moment, and then incisions the area.
And so with the medicines which cause the cessation of the flow of blood, such as vinegar, and wine, and enxofre, adjusted with alum of vinegar.
And then administer a broad needle of lead so that the wound is not solidified carelessly.
Keep it for several days and administer cold lime juice
And so with the other care of consolidation until it is healed
Many times these accidents happen in the great majority of births of other animals, and so you should incisions according to this manner If there is swelling of the brain, do not make incisions against the swelling in any way

Of the care of haemorrhoids, piles and red swelling that occur in the groin of women.
Haemorrhoids are caused by the congestion of the veins around the rectum, and as long as they are not excessively painful, they should be treated conservatively
I have already spoken about the different kinds of these and their signs, and I say that those who receive treatment and those who do not receive treatment should be treated differently
Therefore I say that haemorrhoids and piles are not very painful when they are in the prime of life and do not cause discomfort, it is not necessary to treat them with iron
If however they are in the groin and cause discomfort, then they must be treated
And so you should place the woman in a cold bath and extend her with the thumbs upwards, or with rough hands, and incisions should be made at the root of the veins
And so sprinkle over those veins the flow of blood from one of the incisions so that the bleeding stops, just like vinegar and the like
And so keep the legs pressed for an hour, and then stop that for cold water
And if the bleeding persists, do that which will cause decoction of alum and of poppy seeds and of mustard and of vinegar and the like
And so take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar and make a plaster with water over both of them
If the blood is clotted, it is good; otherwise, adhere to two cushions, and to the nipples sacrifice.
And so take wool and soak it in the juice of cocksfoot or in the juice of elderberry or in the juice of pomegranate with a little wine and adhere it to the area; and care for the area until it is healed
And care for the area until it is healed.</start_of_turn>

I will tell you in this treatise of the caut which is used in the groin when it is a carbuncle, and if you wish to know how it is performed with the iron, I will tell you

Then consider that you must cease the pain over a bladder that has two bladders; recline on the buttocks two and adjust the feet of the patient below the belly, and the buttocks will be expanded, and stop the hands of the patient below the navel, and tie whatever is convenient to them
And approach the matron following the lord's order and administer the instrument with which the opening of the major orifice has been made, the form of which will come in those cases that make it necessary.
And consider that when you administer this instrument, stay with the edge of the major orifice of the bladder, and what enters from the instrument into the bladder should not be more than the edge of the bladder and cause the patient pain. If the instrument is larger than the edge of the bladder, then consider that you should sprinkle powder over the surface of the edge of the bladder so that the insertion of any instrument into the bladder is prohibited
And consider that you should stop the vertigo that runs in the instrument of the lord once it is detached and that the minister should hold the instrument and rotate the vertigo until it is inserted into the major orifice of the bladder.
And when the evacuation is complete, and it is grasped by hand and is lean and wet, then consider that you should remove the head of the instrument from the wound with a sponge soaked in fat
And when the urine is evacuated, consider that you should place a wick soaked in olive oil or green oil at the opening of the bladder; and stop the bleeding at the incision in the major orifice of the bladder.
And stop the bleeding from the bladder and put a clean bandage over the wound soaked in water in which are boiled mallows.
And approach both cured two days from now and until today when they are convenient to water until they are healed
And every day the bladder and the wound are washed with water and vinegar, and with water in which lilies or long-stemmed violets are boiled, and then return to the wound
And if the wound in the bladder is inflamed and swollen, consider that you should refrain from its care with iron, having cared for what has been said in the division.

To teach the midwives how to properly handle patients with unusual figures.
A necessary cause is that the midwife should already know in the beginning the figure of the natural childbirth for signs of it, and that when a woman gives birth to the parts beyond and wants to smell the air, and what is expelled by her about what is above, and it is stifled by what is below, the hour knows that this part is of a natural figure, and that is the sensation of it on the head, and the second that it is about that or the umbilical cord or suspension.
Therefore, when you see these signs, consider that the belly of the womb should be compressed so that the embryo can give birth easily when it comes out of the head, and that it is moistened from those superfluities with good management.
More than that, that part is not natural and unusable, because when the embryo is ejected from its feet and the body of the fetus is ejected in front of the head of the fetus, and the hand of the fetus, or at the foot of the fetus, etc., then... ...or the head of the fetus and the hand of the fetus, or at the belly of the fetus, and it turns into a figure like those that are not usable
A necessary cause is that the midwife be wise and skillful in all those cases, and that she guard against error and deception
And I show you all the figures of those things, and what is their meaning for what is significant and what has been stated about it
When the fetus is ejected from the head for natural evacuation, and that is vehement over the woman and is difficult for her, and sometimes the virtue of the woman is already exhausted, the hour recommends that one should do what the women have to do, and that one should expel the afterbirth with rue and with oil.
And approach the matron between the thighs and say to her that we must insert a little sponge and open that which is at the second part, or cut that which is at the navel until it comes out what is in it of humidity E preme le ventre de la femna entro que deyssenda le fet.
Maybe if it does not descend, the hour covers that the woman be impregnated with mucus of peas and fennel with blood.
And order them to lie down, to cover themselves with a blanket, to compress and to prevent them from vomiting; put your hand over their mouth and nose for an hour, so that the fetus will be forgotten as much as possible
And if the two pains of the fetus are forgotten at the beginning, the hour covers that you reduce them gradually. Maybe if they do not obey the command, the hour pauses the woman over a cushion and lifts their feet up, and then put the cushion on the ground; and the woman must be held so that she does not fall off the cushion
And if the two pains do not cease, and the fetus dies, the hour incites those two and delivers the fetus or binds its body to the hand of the patient and delivers that as well, because that will be forgotten
When the fetus is over the knees, the hour covers that you press those against its sides, and then make the fetus small, and that you bring that close, and that you take a hand of the patient and extend the other little by little
Maybe when they are like this inside the thighs, the hour orders them to cry out, and make them vomit with force, because if God wills it, that will be forgotten too
And if it is not forgotten in this that we have recounted, the hour returns the fetus gradually until it pauses that second figure natural, because that will be the hour forgotten in delight.
And if it is prohibited in all that we have recounted, the hour takes from high mucus and gum dissolved, and pierces all in the heel for good percussion, and then put a little pressure on the place where the woman's hand was, the pus from the belly of her And order that this be done in water that boils, until it succeeds in emptying them completely.
And when sometimes the limbs leave them soft, the hour gives them a fumigation of myrtle and pauses that for them And when the fumigation has lasted for an hour, the hour orders that it be placed on a cushion, and order that it vomit and stretch its mouth, take away from that, and press the lower part of the belly of her lightly, so that the fetus will be forgotten as much as possible
Like this when the fetus is latently hanging from one of its legs Try to reduce its hand, but if that cannot be done, the hour raises the woman and makes her push forward
And if pushing does not suffice, the hour makes the woman lie on her side, and with great pressure wrestles the thighs of the patient, and order to administer to her liquids that are warm and recommended by mucilage.
And if it is urgent for childbirth, the hour orders that it be placed on a cushion, and order to study the reduction of the hand, and to deliver the fetus according to the natural figure, and to make the woman vomit and order her to press herself until it is forgotten
Like this when the fetus is over the buttocks, expand its limbs and the belly of the fetus is two-thirds of its greatest size When the midwife has the hand of the fetus and gently turns that little by little, and that will facilitate it
And when it is equal in amount, and when it has become equal, then pause your hand over the head of the patient, where we have recommended oil and unguents.
And command them to move their hand slowly, and when you have finished, then cease upon a cushion and command them to lean forward, and command them to be compressed; and let them vomit at will.</end_of_turn> The fetus is prepared to come out through the wide opening.</end_of_turn>
When they groan from the mother according to this manner, consider, and when you have finished, then insert your finger into the moisture until it is expelled.</end_of_turn
And if the fetus is suspended on the face and the head, then insert your finger into the navel, so that it is not retained and remains.</end_of_turn
Then pull the fetus towards the buttocks until you pause when you have covered that which covers, and command the woman to press her thighs together, and the spirit will be gone from her eyes if God wills or no.</end_of_turn>
The birth of twins or many fetuses.</end_of_turn> Be wise that twin births from many eggs are rare, and sometimes three or four are born, which is strange and perilous; for these things are not from ordinary causes, but from God.</end_of_turn
And count those which are multiplied, whether by one or more, and are separated by the cord, distinguish those which are within the ligament of the navel of each of those eggs, and each egg is expelled as it were naturally from the womb; and so remain several eggs which are not able to be delivered naturally as we have recommended.</end_of_turn
And if they are difficult to deliver, you must perform an operation and go until we have spoken of the unnatural figures, then take care of those as we have recommended.</end_of_turn
And if the midwife is discreet and makes it easy and pleasant, and is prompt and intelligent according to the figure as she has prepared for the danger to health.</end_of_turn
Remember that they are formed in the womb from embryos and are aborted.</end_of_turn
Some women have periods that last one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, or nine days, and it is enough to verify that a woman has a period when six months have passed without one, or for nine months altogether.</end_of_turn>
And all this is covered by the science of the midwife who is strong in that part like that, and therefore does not pause until she has covered that.</end_of_turn
Chapter Lxxvi.</end_of_turn
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.</end_of_turn
When you care for the dead fetus as we have said in the division of medicine and it does not depart naturally, and you must use an operation with a hand, then cover that you consider if the woman is of sound virtue and is not likely to suffer from the accidents for which she is feared to be in danger.</end_of_turn
Then cover that the woman is covered over the genitals over the seat of the two, and that her head is inclined towards the chest and her thighs are raised.</end_of_turn
And the minister has that of two parts or is bound in the genitals for so that the body does not extend beyond the extraction of the fetus.</end_of_turn
And moisten the mouth of the mother with oil of olives and with high mucilage of fennel and seed of lily.</end_of_turn
And put your hand on the midwife's hand with those oils and mucilages, and interlace your hand with hers in the belly, and seek with your hand the hand in which the nails remain in the fetus.</end_of_turn
And place it conveniently in that place: where you consider that the fetus is prepared that it should be delivered headfirst, and when you have held the nails in the heels of the fetus, or in the head, or in the mouth, or in the palate, or leave the beard, or in the chin, or in the flanks, or leave the hip bones.</end_of_turn
May it be that the cause of the pain is in the feet, in the fifth [toe], or in the middle of the back.
And let us take hold of the thumb with the left hand, and let us break the curvature of it at that place which is between the knuckles of the left hand, and interpose the hand so that the thumb remains in place at these places until the cause of the pain has disappeared.</end_of_turn>
And let us pause for a moment and remain in this position another thumb, or a third if necessary, so that there is equal traction and not simply extension according to its rectitude.</end_of_turn
And thus may we massage the whole part, so that the sensation of the pain is alleviated as is done in the case of toothache by the extirpation of the tooth.</end_of_turn>
And let us say that between these [thighs] the extension is softened; and if any part of them is retained, the lady should anoint with oil the edges of their fingers and interpose these and rotate over those that are retained.</end_of_turn>
Therefore if the part of the foot is extruded, let us exchange the thumbs between those which are outside; and do so until the whole foot is extruded.</end_of_turn>
However if the hand is swollen before the other, and it is not possible to reduce that due to the stiffness of the parts, let us wrap around that [affected limb] with a bandage; and let us extract that until the whole thing is extruded, and then we shall puncture that or at the junction of the thumb and the wrist.</end_of_turn>
And thus let us also do on the other hand and on both feet.</end_of_turn>
However if the head of the foot is large, or if it is swollen in the sensation, or if there is water adjusted in the head, let us interpose between the knuckles a cushion of spines and split the head and extract the water, or that we scrape that with an instrument which is named “alundat,” the shape of which will be like that of the other instruments in the capital which is similar to this.</end_of_turn
And in a similar manner if the foot is large by nature: and let us puncture that with an instrument, or that we bind that with a bandage as we have said; and let us extract the bones with forceps.</end_of_turn
And if the head is swollen and is contracted behind the furcula, let us split that until the moisture which is in the feet is expelled.</end_of_turn
However if it is not complicated, or if it does not obey this sensation, let us puncture the head as much as possible according to our skill.</end_of_turn
And if the belly of the belly is swollen or is full of liquid, let us drain that until the moisture which is in it is expelled.</end_of_turn
However if the foot is above the knees, the traction of the thumb is light and the direction of the thumb towards the mouth of the palm is light.</end_of_turn
However if it is swollen behind the belly and the foot, let us extract that which is wrapped around our hand, and split the belly and the foot until the water which is in them runs out.</end_of_turn
However if the other members are relaxed and the head is returned, let the lady interpose the left hand; however if the mouth of the palm is open, let the lady put her hand into the armpit, and circle over that the head, and draw that towards the thumb; and let her interpose in that place one or two thumbs, and draw them towards those.</end_of_turn
And if the mouth of the palm is closed by swelling of the caut which has happened to it, let us not press upon it; let us rather administer an ointment of oily humors.</end_of_turn And administer plasters; and keep the patient in lukewarm water that softens and hydrates.</end_of_turn
And if the foot is above the knee joint, let us if possible, make an incision: and let us administer what we have said concerning the foot seen.</end_of_turn
And if that is not possible, let us pierce in pieces, and extract it.</end_of_turn
And let us say that we do not leave any cause of discomfort of the second kind.</end_of_turn
And when you have completed all your operation, let us administer what we have said concerning the care of the caut which has happened to the palm.</end_of_turn
If blood flows too freely, the hour descends into watery sweat and administer the other remedy.
I have already seen a woman in the belly of whom was dead, and at that time another leech was taken out, and at the same time the other died. It happened to me or to someone that after a long time after delivery in the belly there was an opening, and it was blown up until the blood was seen to be flowing out, and it started to swell up.
And I was called to take care of them, and I treated them for a long time, but the disease did not subside.
Then I left them for some time with some strong attraction, and I evacuated one of them, and a few days later I evacuated another one; and I was amazed that in the belly there was no bone.
And then I thought that they were the bones of the dead fetus.
Therefore I again treated the disease, and I extracted from them four bones, the woman exists in the thousand milho at ease, and I have seen in such a way for a long time, without any relief from her disease.
I do not know what to say, but in this matter there is science and help for the physician to administer his cure.
As for the forms of the instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus
Like a spiral with which the belly is opened.
This is the form of forceps in which two hooks are grasped in two extremities of two handles. The hook must be more flexible than the extractor, and should be made of iron or bone or gut of boys.
And the width of each handle should be equal to two fingers, and the distance from each thumb to each index finger should be equal to one finger; and the length of each handle should be one palm and a half; and at the middle of two handles there should be two adjustments of that middle handle, which already are fixed, the length of which is the width of two palms and a little, and the width of each handle should be equal to two fingers, or a little more
And these two additions are introduced into the mouth of the belly so that it is opened with those two hooks when you rotate the two prescribed hooks.
Another form similar to the previous one but more flexible and lighter
It can be made of gut of eba or boys according to the form of the forceps But at the end of these there are two additional things which are like sometimes, and the length of these additional things is one palm, and the width of each is two fingers
And when you want to open the belly, the hour you make the woman lie on her side with her feet hanging down, open what is between the thighs of her. And then open your hand with the instrument like forceps as if for grasping something, according to the degree of opening of the mouth of the belly until the uterus makes it so that you can do what you want
The form of the spiral which they call the ancient one:
The form of pushing in which the fetus is pushed out
The form of holding the head of the fetus
And it is assembled like forceps to which teeth are added at the end, as sometimes, and several veins are made like forceps in this way, as sometimes, to which teeth are added like teeth of a saw with which the incision is made and the fetus is contained The way of holding the fetus less
The way of holding the fetus with a spine:
The way of holding the fetus with two spines
The way of holding the fetus with two extremities with which the head is separated
The way of two wide spatulas
All these instruments are exercises, and when there are more of them the more the physician must be skilled, and more than anything else you must ask the men for their help with their number.
Do not perform any work with those instruments, for their use is not excusable.
That action is not justifiable with those instruments.
When the second [substance/humor] is retained, you must forcefully expel it. Command the patient to expel it naturally, and if necessary, order them to vomit. Place your hand over their mouth and their nose, and if it continues to come up, do not be afraid to withdraw your hand.</end_of_turn>
Or, take an egg-shell and pierce a hole in the covering above the big toe, and place it on herbs such as chamomile, rue, saffron, marjoram, and pomegranate seeds, as well as Arabic gum, mastic, and mastic lily.</end_of_turn> All these herbs, or some of them, should be submerged in water in the bowl, and place that above the fire.</end_of_turn
And place a sponge made of papyrus in the mouth of the great toe, and keep it there until the vapor rises to the concave area of the toe.</end_of_turn>
And do the same as we have said, and the second will be expelled quickly.</end_of_turn
If it remains close to the wound and is not expelled, order the maid to immerse her left hand in olive oil or in milk of almonds, and mix that with the herbs and apply it to the area around the wound. When that has happened, take hold of the second and slowly pull it out little by little, as it is likely that the wound will become inflamed. Then insert your hand once more as we have recommended, and when you have found the second, extract that gradually following the rule so that the toe does not suffer excessive pain.</end_of_turn Repeat this until the sides are soft and the left and right are equal.</end_of_turn
If the mouth of the toe is closed, as we have already recommended, the treatment with vomiting and the use of the bowl with herbs.</end_of_turn
However, if it is not expelled in all these ways that we have recommended, know that you must not tire of the attempt to expel it, for what comes out of the toe at the mouth of the toe is due to the female’s condition. Therefore, anoint that area with unguent and tetraherba; for that will bring relief within a few days and will be expelled without difficulty.</end_of_turn
When it has become pale, it is because of the bad odor at the head and in the stomach, which causes the patient’s suffering; and therefore know that sub-fumiguous remedies and convenient remedies with liquids are to be administered.</end_of_turn
Indeed, the ancients often used sub-fumigation with rue and dried figs.</end_of_turn
The way in which the instruments are used in which the woman is sub-fumigated is due to the retention of menses and the second [substance].</end_of_turn
Whether by vision or by hearing.</end_of_turn>
And keep the lower limb in the crotch and the upper limb over the fire, and the sub-fumigation over the sleeves of the fire.</end_of_turn
Keep that within you until the sub-fumigation is consumed and repeat again.</end_of_turn
The treatment of the fistula of the young child is not perforated.</end_of_turn
The young children do not have it, and the holes of their buttocks are not perforated, for they already secrete secretly and are oppressed.</end_of_turn Therefore order the maid to pierce that [fistula] at the place we have mentioned; and if not, pierce it with a pointed instrument, and take care not to damage the surrounding area.</end_of_turn
And place over that ointment of wine and oil; and anoint that area until it is well healed.</end_of_turn
If you fear that it is oppressed, stay in the hole for a few days, and keep it that way until the child can defecate on its own.</end>
And indeed, oppression of the buttocks can occur from consolidation of plague or of edema; therefore know that that consolidation must be softened, and that it should be cured with the remedies and plaguaries that we have mentioned.</end_of_turn
The treatment of the fistulas that arise from the toes.</end_of_turn
The fistulas that arise in the lower part of the thighs are nodular and large, and arise from the buttock or in the space of the one part.
It is a fistula or abscess.</start_of_turn>
And when that nodule is old and corrupted by moist white or purulent humidity, and some veins are seen to penetrate from these fistulas.</start_of_turn
And those that penetrate are known for causing the patient to vomit by their emission and by heat; and some physicians use the patient's vomiting as a sign, and it is very useful for their emission.</start_of_turn
And from these fistulas some veins penetrate into the bladder, and into the marrow of the heel; and some penetrate into the groin and into the armpit.</start_of_turn
And it is known that a penetrating fistula that enters the buttock does not penetrate, for your hand should be placed on the buttock and you should try to grasp or remove it from the fistula when it is soft.</start_of_turn
Or if it is swollen, when you sit down try to grasp or remove the swelling with your hand or with the heel of your hand.</start_of_turn
And if you do not see any discharge of blood, urine or wind, as we have said, then it is certainly not penetrating, and you should take care of it.</start_of_turn
And when the fistula penetrates the bladder or the marrow of the heel, the sign of it is the emission of urine from that fistula, and the prohibition of its emission so that the area may be consolidated for medical treatment.</start_of_turn
Or if it penetrates the groin or the bone and causes pain in the circumference, the sign of it is that the hand has penetrated here if it is not swollen in the bone, and pain in the circumference of the limb; and that from it there is discharge of pus; and that it is not useful for treatment, nor is it consolidated at once.</start_of_turn
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure for all, and the cure for them is the work and diligence of the physicians concerning which they are ordered to be treated.</start_of_turn
But in that which is not penetrating and is not old, healing with iron is expected as you will recommend, and that which I have already done and proved.</start_of_turn
And that the patient lies between your legs towards the navel and raises their legs into your arms, the thighs are inclined towards the patient's belly, and you should try to grasp or remove the swelling with your hand, or with the heel of your hand if it is soft in the fistula, for you must know that the hand has penetrated here if it is not swollen in the bone, and pain in the circumference of the limb; and that from it there is discharge of pus; and that it is not useful for treatment, nor is it consolidated at once.</start_of_turn
And if the patient is sitting on the buttocks, you must place your hand on the buttocks.</start_of_turn
And if you sit on the hand, the hand has already penetrated on its own without your having to grasp or remove it; and indeed you must certainly know that it is penetrating; and if you do not work on it, it is not healing, as we have said.</start_of_turn
And indeed I say that in some homes it is healed in some people.</start_of_turn
And the treatment for which it is expected to help is that you burn the cautery pointed with the breadth of the fistula, as it is said before, and you insert that burning into the fistula until it comes out around the buttocks; and you do this two or three times until you know that all those tissues surrounding the fistula that seem like feathers of a sparrow are already adjusted.</start_of_turn
And take care of those that are wrapped in cloth around the border until all those tissues that are adjusted are healed, and take care of those medicines that generate and consolidate the flesh, and if it is healed, it is good; but if not, it is not healed in any other way.</start_of_turn
And if the hand enters but does not penetrate into the buttocks, which is on the buttock, and between that and the hand which is visibly swollen with flesh or fat, and sometimes the fistula breaks the surface of the heel, then the heel dries from the beginning of the fistula, and you see it dry on the hand, and it is freed both from the fistula and from the limb itself.</start_of_turn
And you should soften those tissues that are surrounded by the fistula, which resemble a sparrow's quill, and do not remain from any cause.</start_of_turn
May it be that during the course of treatment, when the patient experiences sudden inflammation of those parts, the physician should then cauterize with fire or an acute medical instrument, as the cautery with fire is appropriate for good healing of these parts: this is the customary remedy for these parts, and the exclusion of the superfluous humors.
And thus care for those parts covered in hair or in which there is an underlying wound until the limb gets better, and also care for the wound so that the hardened flesh engulfs and consolidates.
And so are the medicines in which there is styptic action and excision; when the time has passed, it is already healed and there is no fear of recurrence
May it be that if the fistula has already penetrated the belly of the cul and is elongated on the surface of the body, then enter with the thumb into the cul and inquire about it.</start_of_turn>
And thus if you seize the limb and enter between you and her, and it is very probable that it has penetrated, then it is not an operation for her but rather by way of trust and hope.</start_of_turn>
The cause of which is to administer in her three ways: either that you cauterize that immediately as we have said; or that you extract that which with your fingers restores the concavity of the limb so that you can easily enter the parts and the subsequent cure; and do not proceed without extracting because you may cause the ulcer to burst, and act with regard to the patient as you wish for the existence of the illness; or that you lengthen that immediately and say that pus which you extracted from within the cul, as we have said, or by means of another acute instrument, and modify those parts which are fistulaed, which are in the excision within which you must perform the crusting; and exert yourself to restore the whole wound by excision, and if the ulcerous pus does not consolidate, and the fistula remains open in the part of the cul, and if there is still pus in the ulcer, be more curious about the illness.</start_of_turn And sometimes the fistula is ended in this way: when you insert your thumb into the fistula, at the waist of the cul surrounding the surface of the body at the hip and the flank of the cul, the thumb tries to perforate the extremity, which is like sewing the layers according to this method.</start_of_turn
and enter into that tough covering of flesh or around those; and thus enter the thumb into the fistula until you restore the concavity of the limb.</start_of_turn
May it be that if it has penetrated the margin of the cul properly, then extract from that thread that is in the wound as soon as you have inserted the thumb into the cul; extract the extremity of the thread and join the two extremities even, and cover each with a bandage, and rest for a day or two, and when the thread has become soft in the flesh, renew that which is between two extremities of the thread and which cause them to adhere.</start_of_turn
And thus care for the wound until it is consolidated and healed.</start_of_turn
May it be that if the ulcer of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever way you are prepared, but not in the belly, because that is not your concern, because you may cause the ulcer to burst; and thus do that which is necessary until it is healed.</start_of_turn
The form of the spatum spinos in which the fistula is split: the curvature of which is not acute and the other part is not blunt, so that you do not cause anything unnecessary, even as sometimes.</start_of_turn
Suturing of hemorrhoids in which runs sanctum at the incision of those.</start_of_turn
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds, either those that remain in the rectum like charcoal, or those that are like clusters of grapes.</start_of_turn And of those there are small and large, and that the sanctum runs from those to the other, and is one, and is not in the belly, but in the extremities of the rectum.</start_of_turn
May it be that those which are outside the rectum are according to the measures of little humidity, of which run citrine water or a little of that continuous sanctum, and according to the color of the flesh.</start_of_turn
And the treatment of that which is inside the abdomen is that the patient should be commanded to sit and express himself until the flesh heals and the hemorrhoids disappear from your sight.</start_of_turn Then you must lie down and suspend your hand over your head or that you have those things over your nail, and thus the cause of the problem will be known.</start_of_turn
May it be that if your nails are not suitable for those things because of the humidity of them and their softening, then take those to the thumb and index finger and extract those from the belly of the wound, and thus insert those and sprinkle over them some powdered charcoal nearby the incision, so that it is applied to those instead of cauterizing; or cauterize those as it is said above.</start_of_turn And immediately treat those with the other treatment until they are healed.
If the pain does not subside with evacuation, then criticize the patient for their scanty diet and wash them with the liquid in the pot that obeys evacuation obediently when the patient defecates.</end_of_turn>
If the erruptions are outside the bowels, their cause is slight, and it is that you take those with your nails, or that you take those with a sponge, and inscribe those, and immediately treat those with the other treatment until they are healed.</end_of_turn>
And whoever has suffered an incision, cover that you administer sutures according to this manner: take fine thread and pierce it through a needle, and then extract the abscesses from the parts above, and make that penetrate through the needle at the root of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the thread in the part below the needle, and stretch them laterally; and stretch the abscess with a strong structure, and immediately give him the thread and extract the needle.</end_of_turn
And do all this, and leave those ones alone and do not boil them, so that the surplus of the healing runs from that.</end_of_turn>
And immediately place over the thighs a compress soaked in olive oil or beeswax; and place that over the body and command the patient to rest.</end_of_turn And immediately remove that within the box; and when it is urgent, treat those with ointment or with another treatment until they are healed.</end_of_turn
And since these are ancient and do not work in this medicine, cover those at the point of spurting or with your nail until they are moist and host those with the thick pus that comes out, which hinders those from solidifying; and immediately treat those until they are solidified.</end_of_turn
And keep those things moist in a ratio more violent than the first time until the wound is healed and is scabbed; and immediately treat those until they are healed.</end_of_turn
I say that blistering is key, and do not be surprised if you do not see it redon according to the color of the body resembling the head of a nail, and it is useful in all parts and especially in the lower parts of the feet and the buttocks, and because of these pains you must support them.</end_of_turn
And immediately cover that which is in the circumference of the key, and hold it with forceps or with a sponge, and extirpate it from its root; and immediately treat that.</end_of_turn
And if you want, cauterize according to what is said above in the groin.</end_of_turn
But a wart is a small, rough, round elevation on the surface of the body, and many appear in the most of the children.</end_of_turn
And the treatment for them is to stretch and inscribe them, or to open them up with thread or skin within the box.</end_of_turn And if you want, cauterize as we have said, with fire or acute medicine.</end_of_turn
But a bee is a small, fragrant or large fistula that appears on the surface of the body like a wound caused by a bee, and is useful around the body.</end>
And the treatment is to take a needle of ivy or of wormwood, and be strong, and place that over the bee until it is contained within the circle of the needle in the parts around it; and immediately rotate your hand with the needle until you have inscribed what is in the circumference of the bee, and stop that in the belly of the beast, and evacuate the bee from its root.
And if you want, do the same with a needle of hare or of iron according to this form:</end_of_turn
The part that comes out of the needle should be grasped by moisture, deaf (so it is not perforated), wrapped so that over the thumb the learning of the hand is ablated and the revolution of that.</end_of_turn>
And if you want, cauterize the bee as it is said above in the cauterization of other ailments in the groin.</end_of_turn
Of like manner as the instruments which are administered to give comfort.
Some medicines are useful for giving comfort, such as silver or lead, powdered or malleated; others are useful from those small and large instruments according to those which are administered, for whoever is administered in the care of small children is small; and of those from whom the buttocks are rough or painful, their comfort is small.</end_of_turn>
The way of giving great and little comfort:
The head of the needle is detached from the thread in which it is bound, and be wide in this manner; and be distinguished by the place where the thread is bound thus as sometimes.</end_of_turn>
And the extremity of the thread that is behind the buttock, which is entrapped in the buttock, be silent (so as not to be opened) more than a lion, hindering understanding; and on one side of the thread there are two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the breadth of the hole be according to the thickness of the rays and more thick a little.</end_of_turn
And the thread be in the which the medicines of bladder of beast or of sheepskin are held, and the size of the thread be a palm.</end_of_turn>
And be pierced by means of four holes thus as it is revolved; and if the space which is between the holes be the thickness of a finger.</end_of_turn
And then insert into those holes firm with firm thread, or throw those away; and adjust as you will to that thread; and when it is placed in it the thread, be straight in the head of the comfort between two distinguished men with strong constraint, and almost comfort that with each hole: More the quality of comfort is that you fill the bag with the medicine, that is scalded according to the quantity of the patient's tolerance; and take care that it is not too cold or too hot.</end_of_turn
And then the patient be placed lying down on the seat, and elevate their limbs in their ease and pause; and place under them a cushion on which already lie men or a servant; and apply oil or album of oil or fat of hen or fennel seed or similar things to the extremity of the cautery. And insert that into the buttock with ease, and the minister grasps the bag and expresses that out two more and quickly until it is evacuated from the belly up to the very bottom of the comfort; and then remove the comfort and the patient takes their limbs to the wall.</end_of_turn
And if the medicine forces that to vomit, keep it for as long as possible; and if he sleeps with that for the whole night, it is better in the morning.</end_of_turn
More if you comfort that in the ailments of the solution of the belly and the vomiting of it, the hours you do that the cautery will be healthy until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if in the buttock there are ulcers or bloody abscesses, the hours be the comfort soft and lion-like, like the comforts with which children are accustomed.</end_of_turn
Of the care of wounds.</end_of_turn
And I have already said in the division of the care of wounds that which is convenient for the free, and I say the same of the care of those with hand and medicine according to the compliment.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to what is the cause of the wounds and according to the place where the wounds are cast.</end_of_turn
And the causes by which some wounds are caused are in like manner as from stone, or incision of space or rib, or percussion with a lance, or with a fist, or with an arrow, or similar to those.</end_of_turn
More the wounds that are in the parts of the body are in like manner as a wound that falls on the head, or the shoulder, or the foot, or the belly, or the wrist, and similar to those of the members.</end_of_turn
And I recommend the care of certain wounds so that you stop that ratiocination and rule about the others.</end_of_turn
And I will begin with the simple wounds of the head, for the memory of the compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that when an accident happens in the head a simple wound and it is not a fracture, consider: if it is from stone or something similar, and if it has already drunk the codena only once and is a great wound and you fear that there will be vomiting because of the wound, cover the head quickly and apply pressure to the head as much as possible, and do not delay until; extract that from the sacred according to the quantity of the virtue of it if not more any prohibitive cause of vomiting, especially if the sacred that is extracted is little from the wound.</end_of_turn
E sia la flaubotomia del contrari de la partida plaguada; e guardase le malaute de replecio e de vi e de viandas grossas.
May be if there is a slight restriction from the beginning, then reduce the food and do not approach meat or strong drink.
And pause on the wound, if it happens to happen after the cautery, smear lard or wine on it where it is sticky.</end_turn>
May be if you are sure that the cautery has ceased, then pause on the wound, if it is recent and the air has not altered that powder which I would recommend to apply a little of.</end_turn>
And if the air has already altered that, then pause on the wound until it has healed.</end_turn
May be if the wound is great or is because of excessive space and swelling, and the lips of the wound are not adjusted for pupils, then adjust those as I recommend by suture according to what I recommend for the suture of them.</end_turn
May be if the wound is already uncovered from the bone and skin, and is not a retention but a small swelling, then prick that and apply medicines to the wound and restore the limb close to its proper place without tension, and command the patient to abstain from eating strong foods: eggs, sausage and fat until it is healed.</end_turn
And if you find pus in the cavity and it does not adhere to the bone, then prick all that is putrefying and evacuate it, and apply medicines to it.</end_turn
May be in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows freely, and which is not stopped by medicines, then inquire about the artery, and if you find that it is not bleeding, then prick that part, or ligate that; and if necessary, because of the pain you cause, that what we have said you should not do, you cauterize until the blood stops bleeding.</end_turn>
And if these wounds are simple and small, the cause of them is likely to be slight; thus if you powder over those things this powder, which has been consolidated while the air has changed those.
And the manner of the powder is this: take olive oil half a part, of blood one part, of vinegar two parts; let it all be ground and powdered, and let the wound be filled with it, and let it be tightly closed until it adheres, and let it be coagulated with the blood.</end_turn
And apply that tightly to the wound and read that, and do not remove it until it has healed, for it is not recommended to remove it until the medicine has been applied until it has healed.</end_turn
And every time make that alone which is to your benefit, when I am not present with you olive oil and blood.</end_turn
And thus this medicine has been used in great wounds when it was considered that it should be interrupted over those and that they were stretched, and only for recent wounds where the blood has not been altered.</end_turn
And if the air has already altered it, especially in summer, it is not understood concerning the position of this powder, but rather you should apply that which we have said, that is, if you stop over these abscesses with decoction, or that you stop over the grains of barley with water and honey until it has become reduced; and apply the other treatment along with this until they are healed.</end_turn
May be if the wound fractures the bone, and is small, then extract that with your hand.</end_turn
And I say the treatment for fractures of the head is in poison.</end_turn
The provided text does not include information regarding "plaguas del col", so I am unable to translate that portion.
May be if the wound occurs in the heel, there is no difference in treatment between that and a simple wound of the head.</end_turn
May be if the nerves of the heel are cut or an artery, then if it is a nerve, it is not in its healing but that it should be avoided treatment of it with that which makes violent constriction, just as with zinc and sage which is old and resembles them because it does not cause the nerves to swell and relieves that.</end_turn And do not pause on any cause of great cold, because the substance of the nerves is cold and the continuation of them is at the brain, which is the most important of all the members.</end_turn
And if it is necessary to treat it with medicines that are light, even like washing with lukewarm water, any vegetable matter boiled in olive oil or not, and then when washed with lukewarm water and the other stones that are not harmful according to this manner, and heat.
When the plague is great, administer sutures, or bind the lips tightly, and then care for the swelling that remains until it is healed.
When the plague is profound or severe in the lower parts, the doctor will perforate it in the most depressed area
When an artery has already been cut in the plague and blood flow has stopped, the doctor will separate or dry that area, or ligate that area, or cauterize that area if necessary to prevent further bleeding
When the vertebrae of the groin or all of them have already been cut, and the veins of the belly have been preserved, the doctor will adjust the lips of the belly with sutures over the edge of the groin and do not touch that; elevate that and reduce that to its natural position, and then strengthen that by stretching downwards, and rest that for several days; and care for that which is in the bowels where there is stickiness and excitement until it is healed.
When the plague has already caused great damage to the bones, the doctor will pierce that; and if there are fragments of bone, remove them all; and what is not injured, rest that until the plague has subsided, and let the discharge of that be alleviated
And if the plague is recent, the doctor will sprinkle powder over that powder which has been recommended When there is a fistula in the plague, the doctor will care for that as soon as it comes to his mind in the capital city.
If it is percussion of the hip or of the shoulder, and sometimes of the groin, and sometimes of the depth of it, the doctor considers more if there is excessive wind in the patient; the doctor knows that the plague is mortal
And if there is not depth and the plague is recent at the edge of the wound, the doctor will stop there for the first hour with powder, and do not strengthen that because it will not retain the blood in the depth of the wound and will return to its course and aggravate the disease, more than stopping it there attracts, and remove those two veins that give the day.
And if the vomit is not at your present, the doctor will pause at the orifice of the plague because of the humors; and make the patient sleep over the plague so that it runs off what is in it adjusted
When already from the plague three days have passed or more and the patient does not have spasms or trembling of the body or stiffening of the bowels, and sometimes other good signs of the patient, the doctor knows that the plague is saved; and then care for that as for calamine and another care until it is healed
When the healing of the wound is excused, and has already passed a long time, the doctor knows that there is already a fistula; care for that for the capital city
And if the plague is for incision of the space or of the shoulder, and is simple on the surface of the foot or of the thigh, the doctor will care for that with a suture if it is great, or with powder if it is small
When already great damage has been caused to the bones, and only a few fragments remain, the doctor will turn the plague and cover to extract those fragments, if they are separated When they are not separated, the doctor will rest them until the plague subsides, because the extraction of them is alleviated
And as for the other plagues that happen in the other limbs, the help in their care is the help of what has been said above.
Of the plagues of the belly.
The indisposition that happens in the belly is either great, or little, or moderate
A slight rupture is difficult by another method, and if it is so, if you do not guard against the intrusion of them into the cavity of the body, it will open up and swell because the substance of them is already spoiled.
Therefore the best rupture is moderate, because in that one the reduction of the belly is not difficult, just as it is difficult in the two preceding ones.
The suture of the belly is done in four ways, more commonly two sutures are common than in the sutures of the other parts of the body
Two other sutures similar to these connect the other wounds, but in the suture of the belly they are more specific.
And I recommend to you that you make any necessary exposure and declaration.</end_of_turn>
Therefore I say that when the wound is small and there is any cause of the intestine remaining outside, and it is difficult to reduce it, then there are two methods: either because of the small size of the disruption as we have said, or when the intestine is inflamed by the cold air.</end_of_turn>
And therefore, when it is like this, you must cover that area with a sponge soaked in warm water, or that you compress it with water squinance, and cypress, and pepper, and cloves, until the inflammation is resolved.</end_of_turn
And many doctors make it so that the vinegar is in the vinegar in which it has been steeped, and it is better than simply with water in resolving the inflammation.</end_of_turn>
And when the inflammation has been resolved, then you must moisten the intestine with water in which it is contained, so that because of this the contents of it are alleviated with little cause.</end_of_turn
However, if the intestines are not evacuated immediately, you must make an incision with a small instrument with which are incised the sores.</end_of_turn
The first treatment is better when it is appropriate and does not cause excessive drying, and is not necessary to dry it immediately.</end_of_turn
Of the instrument, dry its shape:
One part is acute, and the other not acute, and the extremity blunt, and do not be like the shape of a spatula, advancing neither obtusely a little.</end_of_turn
And when the wound is enlarged and the intestine is outside, then you must cover that the reduction is according to its natural shape, in the place where it is proper, if possible over the wound, because it is better.</end_of_turn
However, when the disruption is wide and is in the lower part of the belly, then you must make the patient lie on his two sides, and suspend your limbs above the navel; and if it is in the upper part of the belly, you must suspend the head and the limbs above the chest.</end_of_turn
Similarly, if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the belly, then you must suspend your attention and your thought for a moment so that the part in which the wound is located is higher than the other.</end_of_turn
And so you must administer water in the large wounds and in the small wounds.</end_of_turn
And in the small wounds, suspend water until it is ready, and make sure that it is administered between your greatest pressures, which has the disruption whole with its hand and adjusts the lips of it, and immediately uncover from this to that which if it should happen to close any cause of this other.</end_of_turn
This is the common suture method: that you grasp the needle, or the needle handle according to the size of the wound; and immediately grasp from the tip of the disruption of the ring finger, and tighten the needle one, or more that you do not put faith in the two extremities of the codena, at the two extremities of the scaphoid that is left by the codena of the parts that are downwards, until you have pierced that part; and you have already added two extremities of the codena and two extremities of the scaphoid, so there are four orders in total.</end_of_turn
And tighten firmly twice around the circuit of the needle, and several threads of two parts together, and immediately add the two lips and the wound together by adding downwards; and immediately withdraw the thickness of the finger and fix another needle in that place, and immediately bind that as firmly as the first needle; and do not stop until you have completed the contraction of the wound.</end_of_turn
And the fine needles between thickness and bluntness, because the fine needles do not bite cruelly; and the thick ones are difficult to handle in the codena, and therefore because of this you must make them move in bluntness and thickness.</end_of_turn
And do not make the needle stay in two extremities of the codena too much, for so the flesh is not bitten cruelly and the wound is healed before its consolidation.</end_of_turn
And do not prolong the suture too much so that the wound is not prohibited from consolidation.</end_of_turn>
And immediately after piercing the extremities of the needles so that it does not cause the patient to shiver; and you will pause on the suture of pulpy expansions of every part, which have the extremities of the needles; and leave them in place until you know that the wound is already consolidated.</end_of_turn
These kinds of sutures with needles in the palm of the hand are more convenient in small wounds, where there is only need for one needle or two, or around those.
The second suture should be done cautiously: and it is that you administer the suture to the four extremities, from the shoulder and two extremities of the forearm, in a bundle, with a needle in which there is reliable envelopment of the tissue in smoothness and size.</end_of_turn>
And when the needle has pierced these four extremities, reduce the needle of that middle part from which you began, so that the faithful thread retracts somewhat from the part that hangs up on the wound, so that the suture is as strong as the other that is made with the thread with which they are dressed.</end_of_turn>
And pause between each suture the quantity of the thickness of the middle finger.</end_turn>
And this suture saves the lives.</end_turn>
And thus I sutured the wound which was caused to a man in the navel who was stung by a wasp, and it was the disruption of the greatest wound of a palm, and it was ejected from between two palms of the heel and was the disruption in the middle of the limb; and when I had reduced that which had been outside the wound for xxx hours.</end_turn>
And the wound healed in the space of fifteen days or so, and it was cured; and thus I saw that for a month, and it was reported to me afterwards.</end_turn
And other doctors had judged that it would not be cured; and by a miracle, behold, it was cured, for in that place where no other remedy had been found or medicine, I simply put a compress over the wound every two days and I bathed it diligently with honey water until it healed.</end_turn
But I say two kinds of sutures that are proper according to the narration of Paraula.</end_turn
And it is that you begin with the suture of the shoulder, and you enter the needle from the back to the front.</end_turn
And thus when the needle penetrates the shoulder and in that middle laceration according to the rule and in length throughout the body, and leave the forearm in which you have introduced the needle; and make penetrate in the other extremity the needle from the back to the front in the other extremity of the limb.</end_turn
And thus when you have finished that penetration, then make another penetration in that same middle part of the limb from the back to the front; and leave the forearm which is in that laceration, and make penetrate the needle in the other extremity from the back to the front.</end_turn
And thus make penetrate in that way that the one that you make in the forearm at the level of the wrist where all those penetrate.</end_turn
And thus begin from this middle side and grasp that which is the forearm in the other side, and extract the needle from the shoulder which penetrates, and then reduce that in that shoulder and close the forearm which is in the other side to this extremity; and extract that from the shoulder which is of the side of the thighs.</end_turn
And thus make one turn and another, and make one turn almost another turn until you have closed all that which is outside according to that example.</end_turn
And the sum of this manner of stitching is that you close with a suture of hair with which you close the skin, in such a way that you close the forearm one turn from the part of the wrist, and that you leave that other turn until it is completed.</end_turn
But the second kind of suture which I say openly is Gualia, and this is of such nature that it is recommended that you close that according to the manner in which many doctors close that, in such a way that you add all the parts to their proper parts; and apply the forearm of one to the other of the thighs, and that which is done is right according to what I recommend to you.</end_turn
Because you must keep the needle in the forearm at your will from the part of the front, and make that penetrate to the part of the back in that hole, and leave two forearms; and then turn the needle and make that penetrate from front to back in two forearms of the limb.</end_turn
And thus turn those parts, and make penetrate whatever of the back parts into the front part in two extremities of the limb other than those which are in the side.</end_turn
And this manner of stitching is better than the common suture of the leg, and is a suture of which there is precedent.</end_turn>
This is the speech of Gualia.
And thus I say to you, the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles, so that you enter into these with any thread, and begin with the inside needle from that which is due to you, and make that penetrate into the other side according to the suture of those which cause the body to swell.</end_of_turn>
And know that when the disruption is in the middle of the belly, then the suture of it is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.</end_of_turn
Moreover, the judgment of the plague is the judgment of the other plagues.</end_of_turn>
The cause is that when you recognize the recent plague on the skin, then the air alters that, and reduces the swelling and boils of that, and makes that descend adequately, then you stop over that dusty powder.</end_of_turn
And if the air has already altered the plague, then you stop over that ulcer until those which are at your presence enter within that it makes the skin hard and black, and that consolidates; and you watch over it like that; and you care for that just as for the care of the other plagues until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if you are not present with the medicines, then you stop over that immediately, because it begins to vomit bile, cough violently, and exchange two meals a day, just as you and I teach, until it is healed, for you do not take any other medicine in large quantities when the plagues are simple.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if you fear that the plague communicates by wound to the principal members, then you cover that you immerse linen soaked in oil of lavender of good quality, or in rosemary oil, and stop that in the circuit of the places that are between the armpits and leave the armpits open.</end_of_turn
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in the swellings, that many meals have been vomited, then you crush that with black vinegar which you should give to him, especially if the swelling has been reached in the belly and is clearly useful for the evacuation penetrating into the curvature of it.</end_of_turn
And know that that which is of the big belly is easier to heal than that which is in the small belly.</end_of_turn
And it is of difficult healing that which is called “gegunu” which does not receive healing from the plague that remains in it of all; and that is because of the great multitude of veins that are in it and for the greatness of it that is in those, and for the subtlety of the body of that, and for its proximity to nature of nerves.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if what proceeds from the plague is the cloth, and you have recently recognized it, reduce that according to your precept which you reduce the swellings of the body.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if it has passed to the space and it is already green or black, then you strengthen that with a needle over the place that is degraded of it, so that comes out flow of health, for there are veins and arteries in the cloth.</end_of_turn
And thus it is said that another ligament is necessary, and you stop two extremities of the thread pending the part left of the plague outside, so that on your part there is relieved the attraction of it from the body and the emission of the bile of the plague.</end_of_turn
Remember the plagues when they happened in the belly.</end_of_turn
When disruption occurs in the belly and it is slight, it is possible that it remains contained in the ulcer homes, to help so that you see that which was previously sick in the belly with percussion of the palm and which was the plague of the right part of the stomach, and the plague was old and had become fistula, and evisceration of it with wind.</end_of_turn
And thus I proceed with the care of it even if it is not confident in the healing of it, but I cease to subtilize it until it is healed and the place is consolidated.</end>
And I must say that when you see the place already consolidated, time passes over the sickness that you remember having happened in the belly; and do not remember anything for that which happened and remain in your many things doing and eating, and approach in bath and exercise in your words.</end_of_turn
And I say that those who have experienced it say that when the plague is in the belly, and it is slight, it must be bound in this manner: that you take large grains of barley; and that you adjust the two lips of the plague and stop a barley from those which are above the two lips of the plague; therefore when you take over those and stretch your mouth, you burst the head of it, which adheres and is not dissolved.</end_of_turn
And immediately stop another bleeding from the first one, and do not cease until bleeding has stopped throughout the entirety of the wound.
And immediately reduce the swelling with the wound closed; and keep those extremities attached in the belly until the swelling has subsided; and do not cause any damage to the patient during the process.</end_of_turn>
And it is already possible that the swelling is attached to the surrounding flesh, which is caused by the swelling of the beast's belly attached to it; because it is more pointed; and that you grasp the extremity of these veins of the belly, and do not dissect it, and immediately bind the extremity to it with gutta and thread, and encase the thread in needles and cos it up again to that swelling.
This way of stitching with bleeding is nothing but by faith and hope.</end_of_turn>
Even if the wound is large and wide, most of all if it is in a delicate toe, the time is not to be hasty but to be skillful, and not to heal it entirely.</end_of_turn>
Care for wounds and fistula.</end_of_turn>
Be aware that all wound and swelling when they age become ulcers, and it is called a fistula when it is not consolidated and does not break down, whatever the part of the body it is in.</end_of_turn
And fistula according to truth is a foul, hard, white swelling which does not cause pain and which is concave like the swelling of a wound of punishment; and for this reason it is named after that punishment, that is, wound.</end_of_turn
And it is in a wet wound that the swelling breaks down; and when the humidity is strong, it is expelled in a few hours.</end_of_turn And many plants have this humidity, it is little, it is great, and it is subtle.</end_of_turn
Indeed, all those causes have been shown, and the treatment of them with medicines has been mentioned in the division.</end_of_turn
And so I inform you of the treatment of fistula which is effective by surgical means with the hand.</end_of_turn
And you know that fistula can occur in all parts of the body; for example, fistulas which run through great veins and arteries, or nerves, or the bladder, or the belly, or the testicles, or in any of the vertebrae, or in any of the compound joints such as the hand and foot; and those which give proximity to the main limb and its vicinity.</end_of_turn
Therefore, of all these fistulas, which are treated in this way, some are those of difficult healing, and do not receive care, and are accompanied by work and ignorance.</end_of_turn
And if it is of any fistula the depth of which does not reach these places that have been mentioned, and you hope and trust in the treatment of them, and you wish to learn about them, when you wish to remove or cut them out, and if the fistula goes according to rule, inquire about that from me.</end_of_turn
And if the fistula is tortuous, however, investigate that which is under the skin, for the swelling of the body is alleviated and curved over the tortuousness.</end_of_turn
And if the fistula has no very horrifying motion, it is not in your power to signify about it when you attempt to do so.</end_of_turn
Therefore glorify the Lord for his works, for the humidity for which you glorify him goes away from the other works and comes from them.</end_of_turn
And immediately inquire thoroughly, according to what manner you are able, if here you have bone or nerve, and whether the fistula is long or short, or if it is one to which there is more than one orifice and this is over all that you can do with the sum of your strength, with your wisdom, with which you diagnose the disease, with which you comfort the patient, and the invention of pain due to your compression with the hand over the area, and the resemblance of the signs and the causes of the swelling.</end_of_turn
And when you have completed all these preparations, look at the patient steadily and carefully consider whether the pain is due to an apparent fistula close to the joint, or far from the joint, or to a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or any other part of the body which you suspect may be the source of the pain.
Look carefully at the fistula as described in the history, and keep that which is in the filtration and putrefaction of the carnation, and that which is born in the orifice of the limb, or in bone and marrow, and cure that which is necessary until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
If the fistula is of great depth and is according to custom, keep the area surrounding the fistula as wide as possible, and remove all the corrupt flesh; and administer cold compresses with acute medicines, and introduce them into the cavity of the fistula which you have outlined with iron.</end_of_turn>
And do this until all the decayed matter within the cavity of the fistula has been consumed by the acute medicine.</end_of_turn
And finally restore the parts which were opened to their natural position when the fistula has healed.</end_of_turn>
If it has not healed by this means, you cauterize it as we have recommended.</end_of_turn>
If the cause of the fistula is bone, and you suspect this, certify that it is so, and dry it up as we have recommended, if you do not prohibit any cause of vein or nerve or major limb as we have said.</end_of_turn
If the bone is exposed and is in any corruption and blackness, burn away that which is rotten; and cure that which remains until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if it is not healed and is festering like this, know that you have not reached the root of the corruption; and now you must uncover it further and consider the cause of the pain and the strengthening of the surrounding area, and restore that.</end_of_turn
And thus if it is healed, well and good; but if not, know that the corruption is in the profound depths of the body, which has not been reached, and do not attempt anything which may aggravate that.</end_of_turn
If the bone is slightly corrupted, or if you are able to remove it, do so with fine forceps as seem suitable.</end_of_turn
And if it is a large bone, carefully extract all of them, and do not leave any cause of weakness in your strength.</end_of_turn>
If there is any cause of the moisture, and in the beginning there is no fear or error, cut those ligaments or flesh if they are present here, and remove the bones.</end_of_turn
If you are not prepared to remove the bones at this time, pause upon the wound so that the wound does not grow worse; leave that which is around the bones of flesh and ligaments, and keep the wound from being consolidated, and support the section which you have incised in your operation.</end_of_turn
Hence, if you fear it, pause upon the wound covered in boiled broth with oil, or upon Egyptian unguent, or in some other soothing ointment, for when these have softened the ligaments, and the bones are separated from their sockets, and the tension is relieved.</end_of_turn
If it is a large bone, such as a limb or a socket or the like, and that only the front part is corrupted, burn away that only as far as necessary until the blackness and corruption are gone, and then restore the wound.</end_of_turn
If the corruption is great and has already reached the marrow of the bone, it is necessary to close all that has been incised and to prevent the corruption from spreading further, and cure that which remains until it is consolidated.</end_of_turn
And I recommend to you that you seek the advice of a skilled man in his home so that he may stay with you and help you with your operation.</end_of_turn>
For example, a young man who is about xxx years of age, who has recently experienced pain in his heel, and from which matter has flowed out from his foot into his knee, and which matter has spread to his heel, is a case of apostematous inflammation, not of external cause.</end_of_turn
And thus the time should be extended in which the doctors are making their mistake until the apostemata has subsided, and care should be taken of the morbid matter, and the healing should be delayed until the fistula has formed, and all the bones and cartilages which have become loosened should be reduced and the humors of the body should be evacuated.</end_of_turn
The physician observed a multitude of doctors surrounding the patient for two years, but did not notice any of them until he himself was called.
He observed their movements and the matters that flowed from their bodies from those orifices towards the great bones; and already the color of that man was pale and his complexion was yellow
And then I intervened with a hook to one of those orifices and grasped the limb with the hook.
And I immediately saw and inspected all the orifices and found them to be open throughout the limb
And then I closed my hand over it and pierced one of those orifices until I saw a part of the bone break, and I stopped there, for it was already dead and corrupted, and the part of the limb that had penetrated was already corrupt; and it was already corrupt from the inside out
And then I followed what I had been taught and prepared from the bone that was uncovered
I judged that it was not in the bone but in that corruption which had escaped and I followed it, and I had already driven it out.</start_of_turn>
And then I stopped the restoration of the wound with medical consolidatives for a long time, and it is not consolidated.</start_of_turn>
And then I repeated it and discovered a second time on the bone as before, and I found that corruption continued in the bone.</start_of_turn
I saw that from that corruption appeared, and I immediately performed the cure and restoration, and it is not restored.</start_of_turn>
And then I found out about it again and I did not stop but I gradually pierced the small parts of the limb piecemeal until I perforated the restoration of the limb, and it is not restored until I pierced it around a palm of the limb, and I extracted that with the bone marrow, and then I restored it with medicine, and it is consolidated firmly and healthily.</start_of_turn
No further intervention is necessary in the operation of the limb and its section, but for the arrangement of the humors of the limb and for the scarcity of its tolerance and fear of its death, which is in all hours for excess of evacuation without undue discomfort.</start_of_turn
Therefore health is for entire healing, and nothing is like the hardness of the bones; and it is a good thing to dispose of them in their legitimate place and restore their virtue; and it is enough for their disposal and they do not cause them to stumble or suffer in any way.</start_of_turn
If it is prominent in the limb already brought to the surface, the hour covers that you should take ligament and strengthen that at the end of that prominent limb, and command someone to extend that limb outwards; and pull that ligament of wool thicker than the first ligament; and then bind that over the bone that you leave behind the limb, and stretch the limb outwards so that you break the bone in its parts, and then uncover the bone over the place where you want to close it so that the saw does not burn the bone.</start_of_turn
And stop immediately or table for a while so that when you do that the saw does not cut the corrupted bone.</start_of_turn
And that the sawing be gradual over the corrupted part, for if it is in the cavity of the bone corruption does not appear in its appearance to the feeling, and forces the closing of it again.</start_of_turn
And if the bone is corrupted and not prominent, bring forward a continuous part with the other, and the corruption is at the middle or in part of it, the hour you uncover the bone throughout; and immediately stop bleeding, and immediately saw that which is in the first part where the corruption is, until the closing of the other part is completed.</start_of_turn
And let the sawing be according to the location of the corruption a little, as we have said.</start_of_turn
And if the corruption is in the joint, pierce that corrupted joint and saw the bones that are continued from the other side.</start_of_turn
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, the hour is not in proportion to them but is cunning.</start_of_turn
And if the corruption is in the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot, it is not easy; however, cover that the corruption appears to you, and open that, and tell us how you want to manage it, and in what way it is possible for you, and in every way make it right to you, when it does not cause you to stumble or damage veins or nerves.</start_of_turn
And you know what is incisions and what saws to use for incisions of these bones are not always according to the situation of the bones, and the preparation of those, and the size of those, and the fineness and greatness and smallness of those, and the hardness and rarity of those; for it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation the appropriate instruments for that operation.</start_of_turn
You know that this operation signifies for you the nature of the instrument from which you will indige; when you are great in study and long and know the methods of this art, and testimonies of the methods of diseases, which you have already had for your master in what is convenient for them from all diseases.
And thus I say to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will perform as simples as those which you will perform at your prohibition, which you will experience about the others This text refers to medical instruments and their uses in surgery, but the specific details and terminology are not clear due to the language barrier.

This text refers to medical instruments and their uses in surgery, but the specific details and terminology are not clear due to the language barrier Both the head and the points of this instrument are shaped like a star with claws, and the points are like those of a starfish
It is not appropriate to join the heads of the joints when they are corrupted, or when the large opening is wide open
This text refers to a surgical instrument that is smaller than the others
This text refers to a surgical instrument that is broad like a razor
This text describes an instrument that is designed to grasp tissue in a curved fashion, with a wide base and fine tip, and to grasp tissue vertically by puncture. This text provides a description of the instrument's shape, but the specific details are not clear due to the language barrier
This text describes a razor-like instrument with a concave surface
This text describes a subtle or delicate razor-like instrument
This text describes a razor-like instrument with curved extremities
This text describes a small, tentacle-like razor-like instrument
This text describes a smaller variant of the previous instrument for cutting bones
This text describes an instrument that resembles a ray, with a serrated edge, and is used for cutting bones in various locations
This text describes an instrument that is suitable for perforating bones, such as a drill bit
And its extremity is triangular and acute-tipped
It is made of Indian steel, and resembles all the causes that we have mentioned of razors, scissors, and saws
From the incision of the extremities to the closing of the bones
The extremities are sometimes damaged either by an intrinsic cause or an extrinsic one, or when you have treated that corruption for the care of those medicines and the care does not relieve it, or sometimes the corruption goes away from the limb without you having inflicted any cause, and in that case you must suture that limb as soon as possible to prevent the disease from spreading due to death or malice, which is a greater defect of the limb.
The sign that a limb is black is that it turns black before it is healed, or that the blackness approaches close to the root of the limb before it is reduced, so that it seems to blacken the limb itself and all its parts; therefore you must know that the limb is already dead in that case
Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is a venomous blow, such as from a scorpion or a viper or from a bite of a spider or from something similar
If the corruption or the blow is at the end of the finger, then you must suture the finger and do not allow the corruption to spread to the hand
Similarly, if you reach the hand, then you must suture that from the root of the nail, and do not allow the corruption to spread until it is reduced to the root of the arm
And if you see that, then you must suture the arm at the crease of the joint
And if another one comes, the corruption sometimes passes around the crease, which is the death of the disease; and to administer another cause along with the treatment is not of any use
E semblantment fay del pe quan corrupcio envezeys le dit del pe, lahoras tu inscideys aquel entro ad un dels nozes.
And if you take hold of the foot, the doctor should puncture the whole foot. Or if you see that it has penetrated to the bone, the doctor should puncture the area around the joint of the bone.
And if the corruption has already spread over the bone, it is not useful to do anything but let the patient die naturally
The manner of puncturing the limb or closing it is that you grasp the ligament behind which you wish to puncture, and grasp another ligament over the joint; and extend the minister one ligament towards the lower parts, and extend the minister another ligament towards the upper parts; and you separate the flesh which is between two ligaments at a space greater than a palm's breadth until the whole flesh is revealed; and then you either puncture or cut
And that you keep the hand of all parts still so that it does not touch the joint, and that the patient receives a slight wound and some ointment after the cautery
Or if blood flows forth during the work, the doctor should cauterize the area surrounding the wound, or suspend their works until the blood vessels are narrowed; and then return to their medication once the bleeding has ceased
And then bind the affected limb with a ligament as desired, and care for that which is within until it is healed
I urge you that you must take care of a man in the sick foot, this means that you must look after this unfortunate man as I have recommended, as he has suffered from a burning in the sick foot like a fire in the air.
That corruption first appears in the marrow of the foot until it affects the whole foot.
And when that man has prepared himself for himself more than when he went for the cure when he suffered from the pain and discomfort of the limb, and when the puncture has been made to the joint, and when the bone has healed.
A long time has passed since that medicine was applied to the foot which was the sign of the corruption
And then I saw that it had passed away, and so I was astonished at the result of the medicine which I had placed on the hand of the physician; for it did not produce the result I had expected, but rather caused the malady to progress to the other foot before it had finished with the hand.
And I was commanded to puncture the hand, and I did not dare to do what I had hoped would be the result of that superfluous remedy, for I feared that by puncturing the hand I would cause the patient's death, since the power of the disease was great.
And when he awoke from his sleep, I learned that that man had prepared himself and had cauterized his hand entirely, and that he was healed
I have not recounted this story except to show what can be done in such a case, and to signify the reason for its being significant and useful to others who may be afflicted with the same disease
From care without wounds and the quality of care of physicians.
When an abscess occurs in a fleshy limb, the space of the abscess is prolonged until collection of pus is complete, and then it is ruptured and drained; the pus is discharged, and the wound remains open as if it were a vessel, and the surrounding tissue is pulled out as if it were a thin veil, and there is no further corruption, and it does not affect the bones or nerves or ligaments, it is called an abscess, and is not named fistula
However, if the space is prolonged until the corruption precedes in some limb, it is called fistula and not an abscess
The treatment of such a wound is that you should puncture that membrane throughout as if it were a wound, and more so when it is thin and is like a membrane, and comfort yourself that it does not adhere to the location by its corruption
And if you hope that the membrane will adhere and that the corruption will not result in any further consequence, and if the membrane has become soft, the doctor should care for that which is in the cluster of pus
And you must consider the safety, and if the limb is large, and the hand which you are using is of such a foul odor, the doctor should cauterize that part with Egyptian medicine which is of olive oil and vinegar and saffron receiving parts of vinegar, and should be applied to the wound in a vessel, and should be covered over the fire until the medicine has solidified and become of use.
And now take what is necessary from the patient and dissolve it with vinegar and honey; then instill it into the wound, strengthen the orifice, and leave the medicine in for two hours.
And now extract what is superfluous; and make water for as many days as necessary until the wound is healed and the pain is gone
And every bruise is cleansed with water of ashes, when it is not at your present disposal of this medicine; and you take the ashes of vinegar, and put them on it; and return that and cleanse it with that until you are confident that the wound will heal in an hour.
And if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the water of the ashes, then cleanse with water and honey and add vinegar, and cleanse with wine and honey mixed, because honey has the property of softening and washing, and wine makes the wound adhere more, and especially when there is an excess of styptic and drying.
And when you have made water of every bruise and you are confident that the wound has healed, then cleanse with water that causes the wound to swell
And you take of fennel seed and dissolve it with that olive oil and wine styptic; or that you instill that with any other medicine that has the properties you have already read in the treatise of medicines
And if the orifice of the wound is narrow in which the catheter of the syringe cannot pass, then you must gradually widen that opening with a small needle, and place a bandage wrapped in Egyptian or balsamic ointment until it is widened
And in the same way if the orifice is wide, then you must suture the edges of the wound and leave it as much as the amount of blood that comes out during the irrigation
And if the wound from which blood flows is elevated to the upper parts, then dry that in the lower part of the limb that is in the wound so that the limb flows downwards, because when the limb is compressed in the wound the flesh is squeezed out of it.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the wound around the bone at the bottom as you wish, then you must perforate that you prepare the limb with the preparation for which the limb flows with great pleasure as you are accustomed and that it is not retained by any cause of the limb.
May whoever is over the wound remain there for an hour in order that it may dry what has swollen in the limb. And that you may know if the blood that comes from the limb is thick or thin, or is digested or not digested
And take into consideration the place of that wound, if in it the patient feels pain or not, and if it is swollen
And when your medicine is prolonged in this way, and you see that the matter that has adhered to the edge of the wound has already adhered, or has proper adhesion, then you must remove the dressing or change the dressing, and when you remove the dressing, change the bandage.
However much there may be nearby of the wound with subtle humors, do not despair of the adhesion of the wound, for the healing of the wound is proper, for in those in which the generation of flesh in the wounds is delayed, and in those in which it is useful to oppose it
And if the limb has been swollen for several days without recovering, then you must know that the wound does not adhere; and if the adhesion of the limb is delayed and is the cause of the prolongation, then you must adjust in the drying of the medicines, and if the medicines are humified in their substance and in their virtue, they are as dry as fennel seed when it is adjusted with excessive addition of vinegar
And finally, when the wound is healed, take fennel seed and dissolve it in olive oil, and let it be poured over wine vinegar in its substance, and mix that with that, and use that.
And thus it is done in that action, when not with a limb, with fennel seed, honey when it is cold, use of that; or take myrrh and aloes and incense, grind all of them and powder over the honey when it is lukewarm, and pour liquid over the bandage and strengthen that over the wound; and pour that liquid over the wound when it is cold, and powder over the bandage and strengthen that
Each vegetable is administered with long-handled forceps and reason from celestial lilies (and these are celestial lilies) and barley flour and centaury, and use these simples or adjusted, crush these and sprinkle over honey which I have recommended; and use of these.
If prolonged, and it is not healthy for this treatment, it is said that the corruption is in the belly, and already inquiry is made in the bones or in the other solid members or ligaments; the hour you must treat with fistular treatment, as is said.</end_of_turn>
Treatment of swelling of the joints and nails, attraction and incision of the finger added and section.</end_of_turn>
Swelling is a swelling that does not leave the nail of the finger outside the palm of the hand or the foot, and is strong in the other fingers, and as it is prolonged and its treatment is less valuable, or is a swelling of a swelling caused by cautery, or is corrupt, and pus is secreted until it corrupts the root of the nail, and is strong that it corrupts the whole, and is strong for its corruption to the bone until it is odoriferous, and is beneficial to cut off the extremity of the finger. The color of the swelling is beneficial.</end_of_turn
And therefore when you have that which we have said in the division and do not confirm your treatment, the hour you must insert all the superfluous that is removed from the nail and immediately cauterize the wound immediately adjacent to that, because the burn is not useful in this.
If the bone is soft and the nail is healthy, and the edges of the nail have already penetrated the flesh, and begin to swell, the hour you must pause and leave the angle of the nail that you have pierced the flesh, and push that back and pierce that again with the point, and place over that which remains of the flesh from the medicines that burn away the corrosive; and immediately treat that which remains until it is healthy.</end_of_turn>
If the corruption has already settled in the bone, the hour you must insert the bone and extract it, because at no time is it healthy that the bone be corrupt.</end_of_turn>
And if sometimes the corruption and the corruption go down the finger, the hour you must pierce that in one of the joints according to what is foreseen for its memory, and immediately treat that which remains until it is healthy.</end_of_turn
If the nail has percussion or adhesion, and there is acute pain, the hour you must at the beginning apply cold to the patient, and immediately dry the nail with rough sponges with transverse cuts, and keep that the cut does not reach the flesh that is left under the nail, because you will cause acute pain, and if you cause injury to the adjusted flesh in the place; and immediately treat that place where pain persists.</end_of_turn
The more adjusted it is, which is born from the most of the household, the more is it meaty all, and the more is it in the bones, or the more is it in the nail.</end_of_turn
And these are born from the root of the joint, or is the birth of them in the bones of the fingers.</end_of_turn The one that is born in the bones of the finger does not spoil, and the one that is born in the joints is strong and spoils easily.</end_of_turn
And of those that are born fleshy, the section is light, and it is that you must insert that from which you must take the root with a blunt sponge.</end_of_turn
And of those that are born in the root of the joint, the treatment is difficult; and therefore keep that from the amputation of them.</end_of_turn
If in that which is born in the finger you must cut the nails, cover that at the beginning the flesh of them with an incision round about the bone, and immediately grasp with one of those convenient serras, and immediately treat that which remains until it is healthy.</end_of_turn
If consolidation occurs in the fingers between their bones due to the vegetable diet or by the birth of the child who did not give notice, or by consolidation of pus or by burning of fire, or by remaining silent, then cover that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape.</end_of_turn
And immediately stop between their layers of fat with olive oil so that they do not consolidate too much, and separate between those, or put between those a layer of soft lead until it is consolidated as much as necessary.</end_of_turn
Similarly if consolidation occurs in the bones of the palm, the hour you dry that consolidation according to what is prepared and convene to the shape of the limb.</end_of_turn
From the beginning of vice, so are varices.</end_of_turn
Vices are varices, and these are veins that are wrapped around large veins filled with melencolic fluid that flow in the bones of the body, and their greatest advancement is in the limbs of travelers and laborers and porters.</end_of_turn

From the extraction of the vein of the thigh.
This vein originates in the buttocks as well as in Arabia and India, in dry and arid lands where there is little vegetation and little rain.</end_of_turn>
It is also found in other parts of the body, especially in the buttocks.</end_of_turn>
Its digestion is putrid, like that of serpents, worms, and beetles, which cause swelling between the bone and the flesh.</end_of_turn
The sign of the approach of its arrival is that this vein causes violent inflammation in the buttock; and it is seen there; and from there the vein begins to rise from the place of that inflammation which seems to be cut off like a plant.</end_of_turn
And thus when you see the limb, then cover the area with a plum whose weight is equal to two drachmas. Enter to two drachmas, and note that and leave the plum suspended from the limb.</end_of_turn>
And as many times as you see it for any cause in the limbs, cover it with lead and do not remove it.</end_of_turn If it is not prolonged, remove a part of it and cover the rest; do not remove that which is contracted inwards, because if you remove that, it causes contraction and enters the flesh, causing swelling and ulceration of the flesh and pain.</end_of_turn
For it must be treated with gentleness and gradually extracted, until it is expelled from the buttock and no residue remains in the body.</end_of_turn>
And from this vein is said to be in abundance in the homes of the wealthy, who are from five palms to twelve palms in length, and I have already known one that was twenty palms long.</end_of_turn
And if it is extracted at the time of its treatment, put the point into the groin of the limb and perforate that along the limb to the flesh, until everything that is in the matter is evacuated, and administer putrefying medicines to the area for several days along with medicines; and take care of the wound for the healing of abscesses.</end_of_turn
This vein has many veins, especially when it appears at the ankle or in the foot, and it causes swelling in it, and is said to be from some vein which is split.</end_of_turn
Therefore take care of it as we have said in the division and as regards what has been said above.</end_of_turn
From the incision above the worms generated under the skin and is called bovine dropsy.</end_of_turn>
This disease is called in every land bovine dropsy because it is found in abundance among the rich and is little among the poor, and is seen throughout the body, causing swelling and debility, and is shown by the feeling of swelling in the limbs until the bone is fractured and the marrow is expelled.</end_of_turn
Its generation is from the putrefaction of some humors as well as from the bites of worms and serpents, and from the presence of worms and lice in the belly.</end_of_turn
It is feared for its malice, for when it enters the body and is raised to the head, it causes great pain, and that is why it is said that it breaks the head, and that is what causes the swelling of the limbs.</end_of_turn
Therefore when you want to cure it and extract it, do not do so without noticing its walking and appearing with the feeling, and when you have seen that the swelling has gone down and that there is relaxation of the limb and strong constriction of the flesh, and when you have dried it over the limb and extracted it.</end_of_turn
And if it is prolonged in the flesh and you do not remove it, put a cautery point over the area until it stays put, and the greatest cause of fear is the corruption of the marrow which causes corruption of the limb as we have said.</end_of_turn
Or if sometimes it comes to the head close to the head, strengthen over the swelling with great firmness, and dry it over the limb, and extract it; and let the patient take purgatives to evacuate bad humors, and keep away from foods that generate putrefying substances.</end_of_turn
From the incision above the dropsy.
This disease is called in our land nafir, and it is a pain that is seen in several limbs, and is usually transferred from limb to limb.</end_of_turn
And indeed, I have already witnessed such a case in which I recommended it. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I saw a small swelling on the funis vein of her arm, which disappeared after an hour, as if by magic, without any other cause.
Then I applied pressure to that area and remained there for an hour.</end_of_turn>
And I repeated the procedure on the other side until it reached the other arm.</end_of_turn>
And I recommended that she move her entire body as I had seen; and I was amazed at the change and the speed with which her limbs moved.</end_of_turn> I had already heard of such things in my studies, but I have seen many who experience pain when their limbs are moved from one place to another.</end_of_turn But I have not seen anything like that in women.</end_of_turn>
I do not know whether this has anything to do with the fact that the woman was old, as she had many old bones and exposed veins, and in such a state she must feel that violent movement.</end_of_turn
It is necessary that this not appear in those who are delicate and have humous-laden veins hidden under the skin.</end_of_turn
As for the treatment, and as the patient feels that pain, do not be afraid to touch her; rather strengthen your hand over that area and leave her feeling curious without doing harm until that violent movement subsides, and then cauterize the spot.</end_of_turn>
If you do not see results immediately, do not be discouraged; at that time your treatment will be the expulsion of the humours and the reduction of the swelling, and sing these antiphlogistic pills and these of serapi, and similar ones.</end_of_turn
From the extraction of arrows.</end_of_turn>
Arrows are diverse according to their species and the parts of the body in which they are cast, for the diversity of them is that some have large heads and small points, and others have concave and blunt heads, so they are solid; and some have three angles, and others have tongues; and still others have shafts.</end_of_turn
And from the swelling of the belly is when the arrow penetrates it, and passes through the os, and is situated over the brain, which happens because of the violent heat, swelling, dizziness, vomiting in the head, and inflammation and vomiting of the tongue, spasm and mixture of understanding and vomiting of bile, and strong inclination to fainting and destruction of speech, and it is situated in the place of the wound a white moisture resembling wax, and its appearance is like the abundance of blood.</end_of_turn
Therefore, if you see this symptom, do not attempt to treat or extract the arrow, if not outside.</end_of_turn>
More often than not, when the arrow enters the heart, it is at the nipple on the left side, and is found to be in a solid cause, not a soft one; and the movement of the arrow is similar to that of an iron bar, and runs black blood, and if there is any coldness in the limbs, sweat, fainting; therefore understand that death approaches immediately.</end_of_turn
When the arrow has pierced the lung, it is accompanied by black spots of blood, and swelling of the blood vessels that are next to the gut, and changes the colour of the sickness, and expels great amounts of air, and requests an attraction of fresh air.</end_of_turn
When the arrow enters the membrane that is in the foot, and the pain is great, it is from the small bones, and it causes great pain and difficulty in breathing, and does not allow the use of all the muscles.</end_of_turn
When the arrow enters the stomach, it causes vomiting of any indigestible food.</end_of_turn
If the arrow is lodged in the belly and remains there, there will be any wound of the plague, or the cloth, or intestine which is ruptured, and no hope for its cure except for its extraction from the body.
If the arrow lodges in the bladder and is expelled with urine, and proceeds from it any cause to the outer parts, and there is great pain in the abdomen, it is known that it is deadly
Likewise with the face, the throat, the gullet, the spleen, the kidneys, the ribs, the collarbone, the shoulder blades, the arms and their joints, they are all saved according to the greatest precautions when the arrow does not strike a vein or artery and is not venomous
And I advise you concerning the matter of these arrows, for they signify concerning their treatment.
The cause of which is that in a man who was hunting an arrow struck his eyebrow in the root of the nose, and I extracted it from the other side, leaving the hair of his eyebrow, and he was healed, and it did not leave a mark on his nose ever since
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew who was hunting it on the hair of his eyebrow, I left the eyelid below, and the arrow was already hidden and could not be found except for a little bit that adhered to the eyebrow, and it was a great arrow of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with a lion’s head in which there were no hairs.
And thus is the Jew, and it did not leave a mark on his eyebrow at all accidentally
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian who was shot in the gullet, and it was an Arabic arrow, and these are the ones that have hair; and when I came to pierce it between two ribs, it had already sunk into the Christian’s gullet; and when I came to take it out, I had to do so cautiously, and I extracted it, and the Christian was healed
And I extracted another arrow from a man who was shot in the lower belly, and I thought he would die from it; and therefore, when three days had passed and there was no improvement in his condition, I pierced the arrow and pulled it out, and he was healed, and it did not leave a mark on him accidentally
And I saw a man in whom an arrow had been shot in two places, and the plague was confirmed over him, and when I approached seven days later, I extracted the arrow from the root of the thigh.
And I saw a woman who had been shot with an arrow in the lower belly, and the plague had settled in her, and it had not improved in her condition even after a long time, and the woman did not suffer any other serious illnesses.
And I saw another man who had been shot with an arrow in the face, and the plague had settled in him, and he removed the arrow without causing him any pain or discomfort whatsoever
And I extracted the arrow from the prince of the king who had been shot in the middle of his nose, and it had already decreased somewhat, and the whole arrow was hidden.
And I was called to care for him shortly after the arrow was shot within three days.
And when I arrived I saw that the plague of the arrow had not spread; and when I inquired about the cause of this I did not find it; however, I noticed that he still had some hair left on his eyebrow, and I hoped that this wound was caused by the tip of the arrow
And I put on the plaster on the area which has an astringent and digestive virtue, confident that the area will recover because I saw that the wound appeared to be caused by the arrow, which is drying up on that area
And there was no significant accident concerning the wound caused by the arrow; and I continued to keep the plaster on for several days, and there was no further accident; and the plague subsided during that time, and he recovered from the pain caused by the extraction of the arrow within a few days after the arrow had been removed from his nose and I confirmed that to him.
And I stopped the acute corrosive plague for several days until I saw an improvement in his condition; and when I saw that I took off the tip of the arrow which adhered to the head of the arrow
And I used that medicine to combat the acute plague until I saw that the tip of the arrow became visible to me; and I left it like that for a certain amount of time, for about four months
And when the plague had increased, I thought it would be possible to remove the arrows from it, and I left it like that, and I did not object to that; however, I continued to skillfully manage and administer treatment for it in various ways until one day I removed them according to the fashion of those in power in the capital, until I had extracted them; and I restored the patient to health after that
The cartilage of the nose is not restored; I restore that, and the plague is consolidated; and thus is the patient healed of the disease, and it is not to be feared in him in any case.
I recommend to you the quality of extracting some needles so that you can pause what is regular and significant about what I have not said, for the parts of this art and the definitions of that are not comprehended either by the narration or by you.
And the skilled artisans compare a little with the few who know little; and in what is present is what is absent; and they find a new operation and a new instrument that must descend from the causes external to the art when it happens by chance
Therefore I say that needles are not excluded from the limbs in which they are placed but according to two methods: either by attraction of the place in which they are entangled; or by the contrary of the other part.
And that which is placed for the place where it is introduced, or is a needle proceeding from a fleshy place, is thrown out and excluded
And if you do not obey these things at the time of the catz, the hour commands that you leave them lying for a few days until the surrounding flesh has decayed, and that the attraction of them and their egressio is relieved
Similarly, if it is pierced in bones and you do not obey them at this, the hour orders that you leave that one lying for a few days and repeat that until the attraction and movement in every day is over, and it is excluded
And if you do not obey this thing for almost a whole day, the hour commands that you perforate in the circuit of the needle in that bone of the whole part with a slight tremor until the place is enlarged by the needle, and then extract that
Maybe if the needle is already hidden in the body of the limb, and is hidden from the feeling, the hour commands you to inquire about that which you attempt, and if you sit that one, the hour pulls that which is convenient for the attraction of it.
And if you cannot do that because of the constriction of the plague and the length of the period, and here neither bone nor nerve nor vein, the hour commands you to stay on the plague until it is amplified and until it is possible to extract the needle
And if you have doubts about which of these things you should do, the hour commands you to dissect the limb in which it is pierced throughout its entirety with all the skill that you can; and inquire about that, if you cannot do about the evasion of the flesh in the fracture of the bones and in torsion of those until you obey
And when you administer the extraction of the needle in any place, the hour commands you to use with your hand and forceps of all parts until you make that obey; and suggest that with your left hand you have great delicacy that the needle is not broken and that it is successfully extracted from you
And if you cannot do that of your hour, the hour commands you to leave it lying for almost a whole day until the parts that are in the circuit of it have decayed, and that you repeat that until the hour is relieved Maybe if you do the contrary of the flow of health, the hour commands you to administer what we have said of care in the head.
And keep your prudence in the incision of a vein or a nerve, or a string, and administer skill in every way possible to facilitate the escape of the needle; and do that with such ease and tranquility and moderation as I and you have recommended
Therefore you must oppose the needle so that the disease is according to the figure according to which you must treat the case of the needle in it, for that is more beneficial. Maybe if that is not possible for you, the hour commands you to administer what is possible for you according to the figures
The wound has gone beyond the normal limits of the other side, or already proceeds from one side to the other side, or causes swelling of the limb from the root up to the elbow; therefore you should draw back from that; and make the incision according to the quantity in which the forceps are grasped.
If it is retained in the bone, then draw the limb along the opposite side until the arrowhead touches the bone, and expand it further inwards, and then extract it.</end_of_turn>
Or leave it for a few days, and then try to extract it again.</end_of_turn>
If the arrowhead is firmly fixed in that place, then pierce it through with your thumb.</end_of_turn
Or if it is stubborn and you wish to give it another impulse, then insert your hand inside and, if it is silent, touch its concavity against the side of the arrow and then pierce it through with your thumb.</end_of_turn>
Or if the arrow is curved, then pierce it through with your thumb from the inside outwards, because the arrow is relieved by that.</end_of_turn
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must cover all the surrounding flesh with something, if possible, and then take care of the wound as you deem necessary.</end_of_turn>
And if the arrow has penetrated the foot, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side, and is close enough to do so, grasp the wound with your hand and, if possible, draw it out.  If it breaks, cover the wound with a bandage and keep your hand over the area to prevent any further bleeding or nerve damage.  Then extract the arrow and, if necessary, close the wound when it has healed.</end_of_turn>
Form of forceps with which arrows are grasped:</end_turn
Their handles are like the beak of an owl, which are useful when they grasp the arrow so that it does not slip.</end_turn
And there are various kinds of forceps, large, small, medium, according to the quantity of the size of the arrow and its thinness, and the width of the wound, and the constriction of the area.</end_of_turn
Like this to relieve the tension of the arrow inwards and push it inwards.</end_turn
Of venipuncture.</end_turn
The veins from which we usually take blood for phlebotomy are usually...</end_turn of which there are sixteen in total.</end_turn There are two pulse veins that are close to the ankles, called the tibial veins; two veins that are in the two temples which are called the temporal veins; two veins that are in two holes of two nails which are called the lachrymal veins; a vein that is in the middle of the forehead; a vein that is at the end of the nose; two veins that are at the collarbone; two veins that are in the lips above; two veins that are in the lips below; and these are called the palpebral veins; and there are two veins that are below the tongue.</end_turn The veins that are punctured in the armpits are worth five.</end_turn And the cephalic vein, which is the armpit vein, is worth five because it is the mother of all the veins, and it is blind, and is called the “root vein”, and it is a medium-sized vein, and it is composed of a branch of the basilica and another branch of the cephalic; and people call it the “trunk of the body”, and the basilica vein is the one that is stopped in the armpit, and is called the “cephalic vein of the armpit”, and the one that is on the forearm is called the “radial vein”, and it is stopped over the elbow, and this is the one that appears on the surface for a visible sign; and the brachial vein, which is between the thumb and the little finger, and there are two branches in it.</end_turn
And in the foot and the leg there are three veins; one of them is the one that is below the curvature of the little bone of the armpit; and the second is the saphenous vein, the place of which is below the crease of the armpit; and the sciatic vein, the place of which is below the crease of the armpit; and in the leg there are other veins similar to these.</end_turn
The nourishment of the veins that are close to the ankles is due to clots of ancient catarrh, emigration, saffosis and ulcers of the head, old evils.
And as for the quality of sleep you must know that it is related to the state of the patient: that is, that the head of the disease must be soft, and the head of the disease in the back of the head in the place where two veins are wide and well-frictioned; then strengthen the patient with a cushion between two points where the veins are close to the ankles in two places depressed from the head; and that is what I told you before, and if you sit on the side of those that I told you, here is the attempt.</end_of_turn>
Then take the pointed lance and that which is incidental, and introduce the vein into the codena until the blood comes out to the bone.</end_of_turn> And then elevate your hand with the vein and the codena to the parts below and puncture the vein at the beginning of its incidence.</end_of_turn And the length of the puncture is the quantity of two fingers adjusted or around that; and do it quickly as much as you want.</end_of_turn>
And then strengthen with powder and leave that which is within until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And already at the beginning of the treatment the puncture of those and their cauterization.</end_of_turn>
More of the two veins that are on the temples that help with the phlebotomy is ancient embolism and bad blood and habitual obstruction and acute swelling of the belly.</end_of_turn
And as for the quality of performing those is that I recommend to you: constrain the patient with a cushion between two points where the two veins are visible at the moment when the feeling appears and demonstrate that you have understood their situation; and if you sit on the side of those that I have told you, here is the attempt.</end_of_turn
And then elevate the limb over the vein to the parts below as I have told you, and introduce the phlebotomy incision from the outside, and elevate the vein in its place; and puncture that just as you did with the other two veins; and do the treatment according to the quantity of your need.</end_of_turn
And then remove the bandage from the patient, and keep your hand on the vein for an hour, and then place it over the wound and the powder and strengthen that below with great constriction, and leave that which is within until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And already the memory of those is recalled, and of those the puncture and the attraction at the beginning of the treatment.</end_of_turn
And therefore the nourishment of the phlebotomy of the vein of the forehead is similar to the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein to the ancient maladies of the face and to embolism, dropsy and fetid ulcers.</end_of_turn
And as for the quality of the phlebotomy of those is that I recommend to you: that the patient tighten their limbs with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument called fossori of which this is the form.</end_of_turn
Pause the puncture when the tip of the fossori is on that vein and puncture it with a lean or other cause in the manner of those who do it; and let the blood run out according to the quantity you want; then remove the puncture from the patient and strengthen that which is within until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Many veins are open with phlebotomy, however, the phlebotomy is not of acute extremity just like the others, but rather of remote extremity, and phlebotomize that according to the traverse, because the bone is proper and strong enough to withstand the phlebotomy when it is subtle.</end_of_turn
More the nourishment of the two veins that are on the edges of two eyes for the scabies of the eyes for dropsy and swelling in the eyes, and to the maladies of the face.</end_of_turn
And the quality of the phlebotomy is that the patient tighten their limb with a bandage, and then phlebotomize those, and you stay standing over their head.</end_of_turn
And the phlebotomy is successful according to the traverse from a little distance to a little distance, because in that place it is not bone; and if the phlebotomy is subtle, the limb of that is fractured is fractured.</end_of_turn
And then do the treatment as you desire, and pause over those wounds, and strengthen those for a night, and then remove those.</end_of_turn
More the phlebotomy of the vein of the nose is related to acute fever and violent sweating, and to the maladies of the face and embolism and dropsy that occur in the face, and especially when it is ancient.</end_of_turn
The quality of the bleeding of the patient is that the patient stretches their tongue and approaches their nose with their left hand, and takes a moderate amount of blood from the middle of the nose following a direct line, so that the vein does not appear to be affected, and the blood flows freely.
Because you have finished bleeding the patient gradually and made the blood flow steadily, lie the patient down for a night, because that is how the bleeding will be restored pleasantly
The greatest benefit of the bleeding of the two veins is to cause constriction of bile and commencement of leprosy and to abolish various diseases, such as measles, smallpox and corrosive ulcers, just as if by herpotromeno.
The quality of the bleeding of those veins is that the patient stretches out a little in their seat, and the physician should be placed over the head of the patient, and the patient should sit on a cushion
And then perform the bleeding of the vein gradually with moderate bleeding; and extract blood in a temperate quantity, or as many times as is necessary; and keep the other vein still
Then remove the ligature and tighten the two veins slightly to prevent excessive bleeding, and leave the patient for a while until the wound is healed
The benefit of the bleeding of the veins is to relieve small boils and pimples of the mouth, corruption of the gums, bad ulcers and fissures, and bad ulcers that are in the nose and in the throat
The quality of the bleeding of those veins is that you will see the patient blush before you, and stretch their neck with a bandage, and turn their lips up, and touch two veins, one from the right lip and the other from the left; and the sign of each is for the blackness of each of both, and the more so in the circuit of those two veins there are many small black veins; and where any of them is seen to bleed, there is an opening there.
If you are in doubt, leave it to me, and do not know which of those you should puncture; when you understand the situation you will learn to make the incision of the greatest of those, and the pus will manifest itself from those.
And keep the two veins that are in the lips still.
The two veins that are in the lip are of more benefit to the patient when the bleeding of the cephalic vein is performed for phlegmas that are in the gullet, for the disease of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth
The quality of bleeding those is that the patient follows the pain between your hands before the sun goes down, and raises their tongue, and leave their tongue from one side of the vein and from the other side of the vein, and the color of each is declining towards blackness.
And when you have bled enough; and keep in mind that you should not finish the bleeding of those veins, for they are arteries.
And the veins that are bled in this place are commonly bled in all homes, and the bleeding of them is useful in two ways: either by making a superficial incision with a needle or by cautery with olive oil; or by scraping with a blunt needle, and this is the way to do it:
Like this with the needles as many times as needed, and proceed to open the blood vessels that are concave and full of apparent large blood clots, and to those that contain thick blood clots.
This bleeding is of smaller latitude and of less violent extraction, and is suitable for the bleeding of subtle veins that contain thin blood clots
The greatest benefit of the bleeding of the basilica vein is that it is one of the three veins that extract the blood from the gullet and the neck, and from which the feet and the belly are supplied.
And it is necessary for the bleeders to take care, when they bleed that, that they keep hold of that and be over-calm in that, because if they err and prick in the puncture of the bleeding, they will injure that artery and cause the blood to flow, so that they must avoid doing that by cutting as little as possible.</end_of_turn>
If the swelling does not appear visibly, then it is necessary to lay the hand on one side and move it to the other, or to seek some limb that is stiff; or to cause vomiting at the end of the arm where the swelling is evident. Then remove the vomiting from the body in the same way as before.
If you wish to perform a venotomy of the limb, then before you tighten the bandage around the arm, place your hand over the area where the vein is to be cut; then grasp the vein with your hand and cut it with a curved incision as we have said; and hold your hand over the area to prevent bleeding.
When you feel the stretching of the ligament, the swelling in the area that you have marked with your hand is due to an embolism of the artery, so avoid that.</start_of_turn>
When sometimes during the procedure of the venotomy, something like urine from a child comes out, this is an indication that the artery has burst; so stop and rest the hand for a long space; then tighten the hand again, and if the bleeding continues, the artery has been severed, so tighten the hand firmly and leave it like that.</start_of_turn>
Take care of the patient's urine output, and remain calm about it, do not fear it for a few days until he is healed.</start_of_turn>
If the artery has not burst, and if you do not see any medicine at hand, then you must cut the vein yourself; because the limb is contracted and the artery is burst; or take a little bistoury, and do that, and take the hand that you are using to hold the vein and tighten it over the area of the cut vein until tomorrow.</start_of_turn
If the artery has burst, it is no use; but if not, then care for the wound from which the blood has flowed until it is remembered that the area where the blood vessels burst has recovered.</start_of_turn
The cutting of the artery is difficult in many situations because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of injury to the ligament of the arm.</start_of_turn
More importantly, the opening of the vein is useful for extracting the blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of the brachial artery and the cephalic artery, as we have said.</start_of_turn
If you are afraid that there is too much tension during the process of the venotomy, because there is a nerve there; if you prick the vein too much and damage the nerve, it will cause paralysis, and the healing will be difficult, and will not be complete. If that nerve is hidden from sight in some people, and is subtle and not visible, then you must stop the venotomy at the point where you perceive that you have already cut the vein, and avoid the nerve as much as possible.</start_of_turn
If the vein is between two nerves, then cut the vein lengthwise.</start_of_turn
The usefulness of the cephalic vein puncture is that it extracts the blood from the head and relieves the suffering of the limbs.</start_of_turn
It is necessary to avoid in this way the puncture of the vein, whether with olive oil or with myrtle; because this is the only way to save all the veins, without damaging the artery or the nerve.</start_of_turn
It is often forgotten in some people, when it is not performed in the first incision, even though it is not noticeable afterwards.</start_of_turn
It is necessary to know that the puncture of the vein should only be carried out in cases where there is hope of saving life and health, and with caution to avoid any risk of complications, since it is useful for the vein that is in the armpit, that is: the cephalic, the brachial and the basilica, and that the puncture of the vein should be done at the beginning of spring, in the spring and in the autumn, and in the winter when there are signs of replenishment.</start_of_turn
And it is necessary that the puncture of the vein should not be repeated more than three days or one fourth of the day after sunrise.</start_of_turn
When the puncture of the vein is administered, it must cause convenience and necessity, whether at night or during the day, in every hour and at all times.</start_of_turn
E cove que efant no sia fleubotomat entro que aja xiiii ans, e femna que sia prenhs no sia fleubotomada sino del quart mes entro al sete, e les viels no sian fleubotomatz les quals ja han passatz lx ans.
And if someone wants to be phlegmatic for any reason, cover the diseased bulges beforehand with a plaster of bees, if there is retained pus in them, so that the veins do not draw out the excess in the phlegm of the bulges, which are pressed, and do not swell the principal parts.
They are not phlegmatic by nature, neither by drunkenness, or by eating too little or too much, or by bad air, or by excessive sweating, or by eating too much vinegar or drinking too much wine, or by eating fat or drinking cold water, or by excessive sexual pleasure, or by excessive work or sleeplessness, or by any other cause that dissolves virtue, or that makes the body weak or the animal sick
And consider carefully the temperament of the humors in order to know if the patient is cured by food and drink, or by medicines if this is possible alongside them.
And take a bath if no other cause forbids, or exercise with any exercise so that the patient's temperament is calmed.
And stop the phlegm of the feet in the third hour, as we have said above.</start_turn>
You must know that the feet of that patient must be guarded on that day in all accidents, whether animals or men, whether it is envy, wrath, fear, or any bodily accident, whether it is work, excessive food or drink, or other similar things to them.</start_turn
And as for her, make present to her the causes which usually accompany men, such as aromaticness and odor, and fat and similar things, according to the amount of possibility.</start_turn
And follow the phlegmatique over a cushion that is thicker than the cushion of that which must be phlegmatique.</start_turn
And draw out the limb, and wet that part with your hand twice or thrice; and then tighten the ligament with a cord and bind that twice.
And the tempering must be temperate, neither too tight nor too loose, for if it is too tight, it prohibits the discharge of the healing; or if it is too loose, it weakens the body of the healing.</start_turn
And when the tempering has been applied, cool the parts between their thighs until the veins are swollen, and declare it to the feeling.</start_turn
And give the phlegmatique a a little oil of castor specifically; and then stop the limb with the thumb of your left hand over that vein, so that the vein escapes a little, and the percussion is calmed because the vein which is most affected by the phlegm is the one which escapes the most, and from those is that which is filled with air and when you stop the phlegm over that one it is contracted against the phlegm, and it is discerned by the phlegmatique; and the phlegm does not burst the vein, and if it bursts, that one is tight.</start_turn
Therefore, for this reason the phlegmatique must be calmed and solicited in all these things.</start_turn
And in case the vein should be burst in a moment, it is not good; but if so, repeat what you have done before and leave that place a little, or perform a festination there if the place is not swollen.</start_turn
And if the place is swollen or the illness spreads, leave it alone for a day or two, and do not tighten the ligament, for that will cause further swelling, nor take a bath.</start_turn
Repeat the phlegm if necessary.</start_turn>
And if the opening is small and the healing is proceeding well, and you fear that the quantity you wish will not suffice, then repeat the phlegm in that place according to the rule and adjust a little in the opening, and do what is called festination before the place is swollen, for the place is swollen in many people because of little opening.</start_turn
Although sometimes that is swollen, do not repeat over it, for that is not useful to you for any reason; and leave on that part a little of the ointment of oil, which will relieve the body of the healing.</start_turn It is better in this location than oil and the others oils.
Similarly administer oil externally throughout the inflammation, to which bleeding from the veins is forbidden by law, and make it turbid and slimy when one of them is applied to the area, because the inflammation is subtle and is reversed when it is thick.</end_of_turn>
And if in the area of the inflammation there is generated great swelling, which causes wounds to appear, especially in those that have not bled, or in the opening of the small vein, and when the area is pulsated, and you cover with sponge soaked in water and salt, a little scraped, and hold for an hour, because it is dissolved.</end_of_turn>
And cover that area with a bandage of sufficient size of the vein with the compliment of another vein.</end_of_turn
And if you stay in the area for several days, any blackening or greenness does not matter; and if you wish, pause for any cause of pain and swelling dissolved, or any cause of urine of semen or of stool or similar to them.</end_of_turn
And bleeding from wounds causes swelling and eminences due to inflammation of the basilica.</end_of_turn>
And therefore place your hand on that area, and if you find them soft, put on your compression on that area, for that swelling is bad and harmful; and then keep that you do not put your hand on any cause of that which we have said, because blood flows strongly from the main vein.</end_of_turn
And apply with oil that is styptic, so that the area is hardened, and then care for that which is left over until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And cover that you extract from the vein according to the quantity of its virtue and according to the color of the vein remaining over the vein as much as it appears.</end_of_turn
Because if the vein is black, then you leave it to fester until it is cured; and in the same way if you see that it is thick, then you leave it to fester until it is subtle; and in the same way if it is acute, until the acute phase has passed.</end_of_turn
And cover that which is full and strong and has need of extraction of a vein in a wound, that the inflammation of the vein is increased and that the bleeding is plentiful.</end_of_turn
And in that which is frail, do the opposite of that, and cover that you extract in troops, and that the bleeding be direct.</end_of_turn
And the best thing for inflammation of a vein is that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.</end_of_turn>
And this method of lithotomy is saved from the flow of blood and from the injury of nerves, and is more harmless and more safe than lithotomy according to breadth and length.</end_of_turn
And to which it is accustomed to occur without fainting, you must perform the lithotomy, and care for that before and after the lithotomy with a little bit of bread soaked in wine instead of a thousand grains or oximels simple scraped; and extract from the vein three or four times.</end_of_turn
And if it is a cold congestion of the spleen, before performing the lithotomy prepare by infusing with an ointment of myrrh or with an ointment of fragrant honey with spices like cinnamon, ginger and the like, or with an aromatic and fragrant ointment.</end_of_turn
And if fainting occurs during the lithotomy, and is a cause of that the lack of blood, then cover that you must precede with drinking water of barley and fragrant ointment; and use of aromatic substances with some, and keep the legs bound to that.
And use other causes that have been said in the division of fainting for evacuation.</end_of_turn
And whoever wants to happen the evacuation of the arms and dissolve the blood according to each time, cover that from which the lithotomy is for the movement of evacuation, and the virtue of which is cold, which evacuates the blood little by little, so is according to the quantity of the virtue in the continuous days.</end_of_turn
Whoever wants to happen the evacuation of the arms, and grasp the blood according to days, and the body is strong, then do that with almost seven or eight hours of the first lithotomy.</end_of_turn
Whoever wants to throw out the blood of the body contrary to the part to which it declines, cover that it should be done on the second or third day.</end_of_turn
Whoever in the body where there is no blood already clotted and is acute and causes fever, cover that you remove from it the blood in one blow and remove a great quantity of it and amplify the opening until fainting occurs, because you have preserved all the conditions of lithotomy; and that you place your hand over the area where the vein is to be lithotomized, because if you do not do that you will endanger life instead of fainting, for there are many who are ignorant and negligent in lithotomy.</end_of_turn>
And do not cover when you want to remove the arm and evacuate the sacred according to custom, as the orifice of the vein is already closed and it is difficult to extract the sacred, so that you must surpass that malice and curve excessively, for that is too bad.
There remains liquid inside that is fleumatose according to custom; or remain with the acuteness of the fleumatosis which is coagulation of the sacred in the orifice of the vein; or stop over that of mercury, or saffron, and compress that until the sacred is outside and settled
And if the vein is clotted, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the clot is dissolved
And if necessity compels you to evacuate the sacred according to custom, and it is not excused, then take hold of that on that limb or in the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called “funis of the arm” is fleumatized in the place of the lymph or of the fatty tissue, when not obstructed or hidden, for it is composed of these.
And the quality of the fleumatization of them is that the disease brings its hand into cold water until the cavity is softened and the vein appears manifestly
And do the same with that ligament and stricture of the middle; and fleumatize according to the small transverse, not latitudinally or along the length
And the opening must be wide and your fleumatization must be of the kind that you fleumatize that above the junction of the hand a little bit
And if the flow of the sacred is prohibited, then you iterate the hand in cold water and let the sacred run in the water until you achieve your need
More so if you are in the summer days, for in that case you are excused from iterating the hand in cold water, and the more is that the body of the sacred is kept in cold water in wintertime.
And the fleumatization of this vein is more severe than all the others, for it has neither pulsating vein nor nerves
And the fleumatization of the cubital vein is related to the diseases of the foot.
And the quality of the fleumatization of them is that you strengthen the hand with the ligament or with the hand itself, because you have placed it in cold water, until the vein is swollen and is shown at the same time; and do the same with the transverse; if you do not do this, it will not be cured in this way
And take care not to touch your hand with the fleumatization, for you leave only the nerves of the fingers naked of flesh.
And do the same by iterating the hand in cold water and letting the sacred run in it, for if you do not iterate in cold water, the sacred will coagulate in the orifice of the vein, and it is prohibited to flow.
And when the sacred is extracted according to the quantity of need, then you stop over the vein with oil and salt, so that it is not solidified too much; and similarly cover that you may not leave any wound open
More useful is the fleumatization of the left hand, as it is related to the diseases of the heel.
And do the same with the fleumatization of these as you have done in the other case.
The benefit of the cephalic vein in fleumatization is for the diseases that are in the lower part of the body, as well as diseases of the major veins, and retention of menses, and the diseases of the tonsils and ulcers of cavities and old wounds.
And the quality of the fleumatization of them is that the disease brings the whole foot into cold water and makes it swell over that friction until the veins appear; and it ties over the ankle joint like a cord; and the place of the vein that appears must be indicated by the thumb, and from that so branch out on the face of the foot many veins that reach the knee
Therefore fleumatize the most extensive branch or leave the limb without its limb, because of the adhesion of the blood to the bone is better and more salt
And if you fleumatize that on the face of the foot, then you must take care of the nerves that are left over that on the face of the foot, and stop your fleumatization with the one that you fleumatize across, as if you were going to puncture it
And do so always.
May it be permitted that I repeat the foot in the cold water and allow the sacred liquid to flow into that which must be evacuated.
And if the physician errs in the first portion of the treatment, then repeat the cautery a a few times, because the place is salt; and fear not its malice, for it is better to guard the nerves as we have said.</end_of_turn>
Likewise do the same with the other foot, equal measure.</end_of_turn>
And as for the sciatic vein, the place we have mentioned must be grasped by the heel to leave the cavity of the hairy part.</end_of_turn
And the assistance of the cautery is to pull down the thigh when it is for the sacred cautery.</end_of_turn
And the quality of the cautery is that the patient between bouts of pain rests, and is relaxed and holds the limb from the waist down to the ankle with a long, narrow bandage that does not appear except for water.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when it appears, repeat the cautery according to the custom of each case and according to the situation, for it is better; or insert it by incision or remove it by excision, because the place is salt.</end_of_turn
And it is in most homes not to be seen; and if you find it, and it does not appear to the feeling of all, repeat the cautery on some part of it, for that which appears in the two feet beyond the ear and the ankle.</end_of_turn
Beware of the nerves, and allow the sacred liquid to flow in the quantity you wish.</end_of_turn
Then remove the stricture and place your hand over the place of the cautery to strengthen the place, for curiosity is health.</end_of_turn
From the breeze and the qualities of the vinegar.</end_of_turn>
The winds are of corn, or of ivy, or of ivy leaves.</end_of_turn
And the breeze is useful in two ways: one is by sacrifice and extraction of the sacred, and the other is by the breeze itself being a sacrifice.</end_of_turn
And this sacrifice that is by the breeze is in two ways, for either by fire or by fire.</end_of_turn
And to the winds that are administered with sacrifice and extraction of the sacred are thirteen parts of the body, of which one is the nail of the thumb which is in the heel; and the two parts of the heel; and the two parts of the elbow; and the two parts of the wrist; and the two parts of the ankle; and two parts of the big toe; and two parts of the little toe.</end_of_turn
And the breeze does not extract the sacred except from the small veins scattered throughout the flesh, and for this it does not take away its virtue, just as is the case with cautery; neither does it suffice that the breeze should be by fire or fire in any illness that is useful for replenishing until the whole body is evacuated.</end_of_turn
And if necessary, we will provoke the breeze for illness or for continuance, let us administer it at the beginning and at the end of the month, and in the middle of the month and at any time.</end_of_turn
Therefore, whenever in any case of these, and properly if it is in the third or middle of the month, we command that the breeze be more useful than it has been for two or three hours.</end_of_turn
And the assistance of the breeze from the neck is that when it confers to gravity in the head and descends to the knees; however, it does not suffice that it should be close to the evacuation of all the body.</end_of_turn
And this breeze is in the place of the cephalic cautery.</end_of_turn
It is not permitted to use those who are excessively cold or suffering from catarrh as attendants, as they give rise to great discomfort.
For this reason it is not proper to use those who are too old or those who are feverish.</end_of_turn>
More suitable are those who are continuously occupied with their duties; and therefore you must command the windpipe to withdraw its hand a little from the sides, fearing the generation of oblivion.</end_of_turn
The blowing of aloes is better than the incision of the vein of the groin and the bladder: and therefore you must confirm to sneeze, and to constriction of bile and spleen, and to vomiting, and to filling up.</end_of_turn
And you must cover the blowing of aloes with a little oil, for if it is stopped from below, it brings about debility in the body and in the stomach.</end_of_turn
The blowing of chamomile brings about headaches and ophthalmia, and diarrhea, and fainting, and pain in the roots of the teeth; and is better than the incision of the mesentery.</end_of_turn
And you must command the windpipe not to touch its hand with scarification, so as not to puncture the artery and cause blood to flow backwards.</end_of_turn>
The blowing from below will make the saliva comfortable, and will correct the corruption of the gums, and will keep them away from the diseases that are in the mouth, and will be better than the incision of the tonsils that are in the armpits.</end_of_turn
Better is the blowing that is made over the two spatulas, as it brings about capitation, which is useful for replenishing heat.</end_of_turn
The blowing of the armpits towards the flanks of the ribs brings about the support of the incision of three veins, namely the basilica, femoral and cephalic, for those three veins together take away all the greater veins that are in the flesh, and the smaller veins of the other veins which enter under the influence of the attraction of the three veins.</end_of_turn
Command the windpipe not to proceed excessively with the scarification, for the flesh is naked, and leaves the nerves and arteries exposed.</end_of_turn
This is a blowing that is made over the cushions and brings about the hemorrhoids of the buttocks and the ulcers below.</end_of_turn
And you must command the windpipe to be a great blowing, and that it should be from the palms of the hands, for the flesh cannot digest a strong section; and for that matter there should be coarse and fine blows and be scarred with a scarification.</end_of_turn
Better are the gentle blows from the palms of the hands than strong blows manifested for a moment, for they take away the blood of the whole body, and bring about relief of ancient pains of the kidneys and bladder; and provoke menstruation, and bring about vomiting and diarrhea; and are better than the incision of two large veins, and of the spleen, and of two hollow cavities.</end_of_turn
However, they do not drive out all the blood from the whole body and cause fainting in many people.</end_of_turn>
And the support of vomiting is useful for the support of the blows from two veins.</end_of_turn
The quality of the position of the blows is that it stops the initial vomiting and supports the temperate vomiting, and does not prolong the position of the blows, but rather pauses them leisurely, and resumes them gently, and that the humors come to the place for their movement.</end_of_turn And do not cease until you see the place already swollen and puffed up and that the color of the blood appears.</end_of_turn
And when you have finished, scarify and repeat the vomiting little by little, and take into consideration the condition of the body.</end_of_turn
For the person who has a soft body of a rare complexion, you must make a slight incision and not too much, for the flesh is not to be ulcerated.</end_of_turn
And command the windpipe to enlarge the incision a a little extent and to soften it, and to breathe slowly and easily.</end>
And if there is thickness in the blood, you must make two incisions, for in the first incision the passage of the veins to the blood and the water of the blood is opened up.</end_of_turn And in the second incision the acquisition of the extraction of the thick blood is made.</end_of_turn>
And if the blood is not thick, you must make a third incision for the third time to achieve the fourth.</end_of_turn
E derierament, quan volem extrayre le sanc pauc a pauc o un petit, abasta a nos una scarificacio.
And if we wish to extract a great piece of flesh, we must make a great sacrifice; and if we know that the flesh is large, we must make a more abundant sacrifice for it.
And the term of sacrifice is the depth of the wound alone
And if the wound is large, hard, fleshy, and its veins are straight, then let the areas of the veins be greased with milder unguents, opened and resolved; if it is in summer, thus as olive oil of aloes or violet oil, or oil of marigolds, or olive oil of poppy seeds; and if it is in winter, then olive oil of marigold, or oil of lily, or oil of chamomile, or of alum, and to those who are similar
And if the discharge is large, frothy, then let the oil be bitter almond, or balsam oil, or aloes oil, or pennyroyal oil, and those who are similar
May it be if the carrier has wide wounds of tough flesh, then let it be forbidden to give oil, and let the areas of the veins around it be washed with warm water or hot water of the sun, or with vinegar, or with wine, or with broth, and those who are similar
And if the piece of flesh is of moist humidity, wash the veins with vinegar or with water of myrtle, mastic, and those who are similar
And if the discharge is thick, wash the veins with strong vinegar or with decoction of rue or of chamomile, or of marigold, and those who are similar
And let the wound be protected from the bath; having said that, it must be administered together with the bath for an hour or two, and let it rest on the wound.
What is it that should be done so that the wound from the phlebotomy does not appear on the wound?
Consider at the outset: if the phlebotomist or the one who gives the flebotomy is choleric and vents over the patient's flesh acutely and inflammation, then it must be foreseen to cause refrigerating causes, thus as great vinegar, and in vinegar of vinegar and salt, and alum, and chamomile, and those who are similar
And suspend their meals thus as poultry, and fatty meats, and boiled foods with vinegar, and those who are similar
And if the composition is cold, let it be foreseen to take almond butter or almond butter of poppy seeds, mastic, and vinegar of mint between broth and water; and that he be recommended to drink little and eat sparingly, and suspend meats of poultry and beef and fish and eggs and small meats and legumes
And let the drink of the day of phlebotomy and wound be greater than the food.
And let him be given in some hours at breakfast or dinner some medicines of musk, such as musk or alum, before or after the wound or phlebotomy, so that the principal members are comforted and the wound is diminished; and let them not take vinegar or strong drinks
But the wounds that must not be made a sacrifice are those that are upon the chest and foot, and upon the navel, in the joints, and the armpits, because these members must not suffer a sacrifice upon them
And it is not desired for these except for the attraction of flesh from the member, thus as they stop the wound over the nipple in the disease of the flux of blood from the member; and they use that to dissolve the cold wind that is hidden in the member, thus as over the belly and the navel; for that makes the member limp and scalds it and leaves the pain that resolves the cold wind.
And it is stopped over the boils when it happens in their boiling or putrefaction, because by the virtue of strong attraction it makes the fluid boil or putrefy and drives out the pus from its place.
And thus it is done when it is stopped over the chest and the foot, it drives out the cold wind in those enclosed places
These winds are administered cold with vinegar only; and some are administered with fire.
And some are administered full of hot water in the diseases of the chest.
And this is because the wind must be full and large, so it is only hot water or water in which herbs are boiled according to what is convenient
Form of wind administered with fire: the breadth of the orifice of two fingers, as we have formed it; and the quantity of fuel is that of a palm; and it is in the lap, in the place where it is in the circuit, the greatest part; the smoke is small according to the quantity that enters it with a needle.
Whether from egg or orange, citron, marjoram, laurel, gentian and angelica, so that it does not damage the limb its position over it.
And at the middle of it, a transverse incision of egg or iron, where a candle is held with fire
And already this wind is greater than that which we have recommended; and little more of that according to the ailments and the state of the one who uses it
And the winds of the elders are extended to others than the winds of the youths and of great courses
And the quality of applying this wind with fire to the limb is that you extend the flame of fire of wood adequately forward a little candle of wax, and you apply that to the middle of the transverse incision in the middle place of the wind, so that the fire is kindled around the perimeter of the illness so that it is not consumed by the body of the patient.
And return it to the limb of the patient, and say that concerning the smoke that we have said, when we have the winds and we do not indicate that they should remain there, and that the vapor escapes from that hole, the wind will be as much dissolved
And again ignite the flame according to its manner, and repeat that if you do not indicate that you are finishing with that.
More in the wind that is administered in the disease of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse incision or burn, and which is not administered except that it is filled with water, and is applied only to the limb alone
And this is the way: And this wind, the greater it is, the better, because it receives a great quantity of water
End of document
Blood is not administered in all members but in the limbs in which it is not possible to place the wind, for the smallness of those, thus as with the thumb and little finger and the like; or in a limb denuded of flesh, thus as with the palm of the hand and the like.
And the quality of using those blood vessels that you have found in the deep veins of the foot is that they are in the abundance of mud and earth
And return the intestines or hernia to their cavity in the morning and in the evening in deep water so that they are softened, and that no remaining cause remains in their belly; and immediately evacuate the body with foam and wind; and cool the limb of the patient until it turns red; and then apply the above-mentioned things
And thus are they filled and in case<end_turn>
And if it is possible to drain the area with the wind, it is better for the benefit<end_turn
And if not, the hours wash the area with wine and add a little water; and scrub and press.
And if the course of the disease prolongs, add a sponge of lead in cold water, and place that on it until the secretion is discharged<end_turn>
And if the disease is multiplied, the hours sprinkle over it powdered vitriol, or urine and resembling their strict causes, until the disease is cured; or that the points are placed on the surface of the limb the greatest quantity of scraped honey, and that they are left until the honey adheres to the limb, and that the disease is cured.
And cover, if necessary, repeated bloodletting, when it is possible to change them<end_turn
And if bloodletting is prohibited, the hours frequently wet the limb with the disease or leave a needle in the places until the disease is cured; and immediately stop them when any sign of healing appears in the limb.
And when you wish to bathe, sprinkle over those a little of ground aloe or salt or ash, and bathe thoroughly
Thus ends the part of the treatise concerning restoration. This chapter is very useful necessary in the art of medicine; and is the restoration of fracture and dislocation of bones accidentally<end_turn
Oh, son of these chapters the fools doctors and the vulgar people and those who for a long time do not remember the ancients or do not read their books.
Therefore, this method of the scientists in our land is a secret; and I have never forgotten it at any time in my life; and I have not divulged it until now, except after having studied the writings of the ancients and understanding them thoroughly.
I have also directed experiments and studies throughout my life on this matter.</end_of_turn>
And I have already mentioned in this chapter all that concerns my science and the experiments which I have conducted on this; for I have abridged what I have said to you elsewhere and spared you the details of my research; and I have mentioned in conclusion what I have learned from these observations; and I have set out in this chapter the various forms of treatment which are administered in this case, just as is done in addition to the declaration in the previous chapters.</end_of_turn>
Chapter One.</end_of_turn>
A summary and collection of the fractures of bones, from which it is necessary to proceed before we begin the reminder of fractured limbs and various other parts of the body.</end_of_turn Therefore, as we shall say at the beginning of this chapter, we shall speak of the sums of the work; and the chapters which follow are intended to bring to your understanding the artifices and their station on the truth of these matters; for you and those who are learned in this art will know or learn it from us.</end_of_turn
And therefore I say that when an accident of fracture, dislocation, twist or any other similar case occurs, it is necessary at the outset to apply a blistering plaster or bandage, or some other means, if these do not prevent any cause, even if it be a matter of virtue, or if the patient be a young child, or an old man, or if it be a time of great heat or great cold.</end_of_turn
And thus let us take nourishment only of light herbs, fish, birds and crabs; and let us avoid large meats and fat foods which obstruct the blood of the veins of health, until we are certain that the caut has stopped, and if you do not fear the escape of matter from the limb.</end_of_turn
And when the patient has recovered, return him to his first place with the attendants who usually attend to him.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when the fractured bone begins to be restored, it is necessary that the patient be given nourishing food which is neither too thick nor too thin, such as bread soaked in water, broth, eggs, fish, beef, almonds, turnips, and peas, and in this regimen there is a coagulation of the fracture which is more perfect and lasting.</end>
And you must know that bones which are fractured in the elderly or in decrepitude never completely reunite and consolidate according to their nature, because of the drying up of the limb.</end_of_turn
But the nature makes amends and remembers that the fractured bone has been suffered from every side for a long time, so that when it is reunited with its fellow bones, it adheres to them with great strength, until it is finally united with them, just as fire burns at the beginning, until no cause prevents it from doing its work.</end_of_turn
Therefore it is necessary to abstain from nourishing the patient with foods which are heavy and viscous and large, as we have said.</end_of_turn
And you must know that the species of fracture are diverse according to the nature of the limb, for the fracture of the bone of the thigh is different from the fracture of the bone of the head; and the fracture of the bone of the foot is different from the fracture of the bone of the forearm; and so on with all the other limbs.</end_of_turn
And I remember all the different species of fracture, which are explained in distinct chapters of this book.</end_of_turn
Many different types of fracture exist in general.</end_of_turn And there are diverse species of fractures in general; for example, a fracture of the bone in its star-shaped area; and some fractures are called complete fractures, while others are incomplete fractures, just as in the case of writing when one uses a pen, which is a fractured bone with a split in the head, or a slight fracture.</end_of_turn
And for every kind there is an appropriate remedy or treatment which will be remembered in the distinct places of the body.</end_of_turn
Motion signifies a fracture of the bone. And thus is known a fracture of the bone: it is a twisting of the limb, with the protrusion and displacement of the limb, and so from it when pressure is applied to it with the hand.
And therefore, when there is no apparent twisting of the limb or if it is not suspected to be fractured, do not touch the bone unless you see clear agitation and the patient experiences great pain, for then it is not a fracture.
There is also the possibility of a slight twisting or small fracture; in which case do not press on it with your hand or compress it; wait a moment and remember the medicines that you know are appropriate in such a case; and do so with stricture of the limb.
And know that when the limb is bent and is not broken in two or otherwise that does not cause it to become limp, as is commonly seen throughout its part, then you must begin to rectify it immediately.
And if it becomes swollen afterwards, leave it for some days until the swelling subsides; and then apply any means that you can think of to levitate and support it
And know that the restoration of the limb and its nourishment is lighter than that of the bone in which the fracture occurred.<end_turn>
And take care as you will remember it.
Moreover, if the bone is fractured, it is necessary to extend the limb from two parts, whether it is the hand or the foot; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two strings or with one string and your hand.
And keep its position so that the limb remains equal according to its natural figure, while the fractured parts are extended from the limb, so that you can perform its restoration as easily as possible.
Be careful that you do not cause further pain or injury to the patient during your treatment; and perform it in such a way that the bones support each other as much as possible in a thousand different ways
And take advantage at that moment of your touch with your hand, and if sometimes there is any other cause, rectify that and support that to the extent of your ability
Avoid excessive extension and compression, as do many foolish doctors who perform these operations by causing swelling with their cautery or causing spasm in the limb as they have seen in the operations of their foolish colleagues.
And the quality of the stricture of the limb is that which I recommend; for you know that fractured limbs are diverse in their size and shape
And for those that are small, such as the arm, the finger and the toe, the covering should be of soft material.
But for those that are large, such as the thigh or the forearm, cover them with firm and hard material, which will connect the great limb firmly and strengthen it throughout its entirety without damaging it
And so, begin, make your evacuation of equipment convenient, and tie the ligament properly in that place where the fracture is to be made with three coverings or four as the limb deserves; and strengthen your hand a little on the ligament.
And look at that part furthest from the fracture site, and strengthen less than that where you have strengthened the fractured part. And gradually lengthen the covering of the fracture site a a moderate degree, and soften the stricture little by little, until you can grasp the limb well again.
And take another bandage and cover that other covering over the fractured limb with the covering, and look at the coverings at the furthest part of the fracture; and do your operation on the tightening of the covering and the softening of that as we said in the first covering
If there is a twist in the fracture, and it is twisted, then pause between the edges of the swelling, if there is swelling; otherwise, do not pause for any reason.
If there is no swelling or pus, leave the dressing in place for a few days; and if there is pus or swelling, support the area firmly.</end_of_turn>
The edges of the wound must be firmly supported and the dressing must be formed skillfully; or it may be of felt or palm leaves; and let the width of each dressing be as follows:...</end_of_turn>
But the dressing that is placed on that fracture must be larger and wider than the others, and the length of the dressing must be according to the size of the limb in magnitude and in width; and support the dressing firmly on the other side according to your first rule; and hold in place firmly as we have said above, and that the dressing should be as much as the fracture itself, and as little as the fracture is prolonged.</end_of_turn>
And let the threads be finer in thickness and in flexibility, and be of thread; and if the threads are coarse, thus I have seen for the operation of many fractures when the threads are cut during the tightening of the dressing, and this is a great error, when the dressing is taken out equal to the fracture.</end_of_turn
Subtle threads are not convenient, because you will not achieve a tightening of the dressing as you wish; and do not let there be less than a finger's breadth between the dressings.</end_of_turn>
And if the patient's pain is in the extremities of the limbs, pause the tightening in those places until it does not cause him damage.</end_of_turn
Some fractures are like wounds, and accidents of disruption in the bone, and I recall in the capitol according to singularity.</end_of_turn
And remember that every fractured limb is not straight at first; the cause of this is that when the limb is great, it does not suffice to support it on the dressing for a few days or a few weeks, according to your security of the advancement of pus.</end_of_turn
This is the way that the ancients restored the plasters, which were placed on fractures, dislocations and twists.</end_of_turn>
Method of plastering as seen in the restoration of fractures, convenient for many complex cases and especially for women and men, because of which it is that about which neither heat nor cold is harmful: and take powdered charcoal, which is the medula of the wheat that is left over from the dough in the manufacture of bread.</end_of_turn
And do the same if there is an album of blood, and pause the application of the dressing until it is not thick or sticky; and use that.</end_of_turn
Another way of dressing a fracture, dislocation or twist: recipe of asafoetida, of lapdanum, of acacia, of enula, and marigold, which is ground from a thousand grains of fennel, five grains of myrrh and five grains of aloes; twenty grains of aloe. All of these are powdered and sifted and mixed with water, or with egg white if the patient's wound is raw; and use this dressing, for it is of good composition and strengthens the broken bones pleasantly, and gives comfort to the patient.</end_of_turn>
Another way of dressing a fracture which gives comfort: recipe marigold and white alum to two drachmas; of myrrh and aloes five to each drachm; of acacia six to each drachm; of linseed twenty to each drachm.</end_of_turn
...all are crushed in a mortar with a rough stone, and are ground, and are mixed with water or with blood and is administered.</end>
Manipulation of joints and bones separated from their locations, and that causes pain in those, fractures and breaks: take lancets and immerse them in vinegar and oil, and place them on the area.
In this treatment there is no benefit of restoration, of ointment, but rather expulsion of the pain directly.
Another method of treatment that restores broken bones: take figs and poppy seeds; mix them up and make a plaster of them
A shortened method of treatment that is administered after fracture of bones and when you wish to resolve the residue of ointment: mix meadowsweet, chamomile and violets flowers, barley flour, and all of this together. All of this is crushed and mixed with vinegar, if the limb is not scorched.
If it is scorched, however, the best is to soften it with water of gentian or with water and use it as a compress
Another method of dressing is stronger in resolving this than the previous one, when the accident is of thick ointment must be restored to the limb: mix meadowsweet and linseed seeds, barley, balm, marjoram, violets, chamomile, all of this together and saffron; crush all of this and mix it with vinegar or other liquid or wine, according to the quality of the limb and the degree of its color.
Hippocrates does not say that it is proper to leave an open wound free that must be placed on the limb after its restoration, except for certain occasions where it is necessary to do so with wax and oil; and I recommend that it be more moderate between thickness and thinness
Indeed in Gaul it is seen that it is placed on the fractured limb after its restoration and the causes in which it is necessary to leave it exposed with little heat so as to do in the case of myrrh, incense and similar things to these causes that we have recommended
A method of dressing that relieves the lesion and pain: mix wheat, barley, poppy seeds, ground ivy or fennel seeds, meadowsweet, salt, and saffron; crush all of this together and sift it, and make a plaster of it.
The quantity should be such that it covers the ligature and if it is too little it is not sufficient to stop the pain or the swelling or if the bone is fractured it is not worth having it. In such a case do not remove the dressing for several days And if the limb has sudden pain or swelling or inflammation, then take it away or remove it in that moment and leave the plaster on it.
Take sponge of linen and marine sponge soaked in warm water, and immerse that in lukewarm water; with which wash the limb until the swelling and pain cease; then remove the dressing from the limb for an hour; then place over it lancets soaked in vinegar and oil or olive oil, and bind over it for a night until you are certain that the ointment has healed, and that the swelling of the limb has subsided, and that the pain has gone away.
And do this in such a way as to make the dressing smaller and less strict, and do not bind it too tightly for your first constriction, but rather do it gradually as it improves.</start_of_turn>
And if sometimes the ointment has healed and the swelling and pain and inflammation have gone away and all the accidents have already disappeared, and digestion of the dressing and stricture has begun, then repeat this in the same way as you did at the beginning when you began to make the plaster.
And if no other accident occurs to the limb of those we have mentioned, do not remove the dressing until three or four or five or seven days have passed Some authors leave it for xx days as we have said, according to the appearance of the limb for the loosening of the bone, until the fracture has healed, and until the blood clot has coagulated over it.
And adjust the bandage more gently than at the beginning of the treatment, and in the digestion of the patient's food, as it is preceded by the memory of it.
If sometimes the limb of the fracture has dried out and become loose more than it covers, then you must know that nutrition is prohibited for it; therefore give it lukewarm water instead of food for three days; and relieve the dressing a little; for this operation will restore the limb to nutrition and will heal it well
More than the fools of the healers of the fracture of the limb, another treatment for the restoration of the limb is more harmful than helpful when not restored from the beginning, according to the covering of the wound; for it is harmful by the operation of its makers, and fear is great, and if they did not know how to do it, it would increase the pangs in the limb when it is free and make it worse in the water of treatment.
And I have never seen anyone do that, for it is more reasonable that it does not happen.
Chapter two: Of fracture when it occurs in the head.</end_of_turn>
The species of fractures are blows, and the figures of them are various, and the causes are different, for every fracture is caused by percussion of space, and the percussion hinders all the bone within the cavity, which is left to the bone, just as it happens in the wrist; and because of this this species is called traumatic; or the space strikes any part of the bone, and strikes the marrow of it and does not pass the incision through to the back of it; and this species of fracture is called complete fracture.</end_of_turn>
And the plague of these two fractures is great or little, and of a fracture that is contracted or retracted; and the cause of them is percussion with a blunt or sharp object, and they resemble each other.</end_of_turn
And this fracture is penetrating that has already approached the canal which is left to the bone; or it is in the face of the bone, and the plague of these two fractures is great or little.</end_of_turn
And the fracture is that which is hidden in the bone, in the substance of the small vein, and because of this it is called capillary fracture.</end_of_turn
And the fracture is that which is caused by blow or by chance or by percussion of stone and that causes any layer of the bone to enter the parts surrounding it, and it is fatal in the hollow part just as when it happens to the nails when they are struck by percussion and some of them enter the surrounding parts.</end_of_turn
And it is mostly fatal when it happens to the bones of humid substances, just as with their heads.</end_of_turn
And all these traumatic fractures are like pieces of glass that are separated from each other.</end_of_turn And I come to mourn for all that is in this place.</end_of_turn>
And I know all these species of fractures by recognition for their detection on them and for their inquiry in their attempts and for the presence of corrupted marrow that is over them.</end_of_turn
The capillary fracture is known for appearing on the bone, and is excised, and is limited on it with a pin, which makes the fracture appear black.</end_of_turn
In the treatment of fracture attention should be paid at the beginning to the signs of the disease, and when sometimes for the signs that indicate seriousness such as vomiting of bile, extension, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, syncope, high fever, and suddenness of these symptoms, as well as the presence of these symptoms in their most severe forms, even if they are not healing.
And if sometimes non-violent accidents happen to you, you hope for health, the hour you begin the treatment of them.</end_of_turn
The cause of which is that if it is provoked at the beginning like that which is provoked in the days of spring, the hour you study in the bone marrow until the thirteenth day according to all custom.</end_of_turn
And if it is in the summer days, the hour you must keep the bone marrow until the seventh day, having left the bone marrow corrupted from the canal, and that these accidents happen which we have recommended.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture has already reached the canal covering the brain, and is contracted in small parts and retracted, the hour you must insert the diminished part and retract it, as I recommend to you.</end_of_turn
And it is that you take the head of the disease that is plagued, and uncover the bone according to custom and handle it as you are able according to the figure of the plague, and that you inquire about the disease.</end_of_turn
And if an accident happens to you, you must oppose the detection of the bone, flux of blood or caut dressing, the hour you are opposed to it as much as possible, and that you cover the area with cloths soaked in wine and oil, and make the plague rest until the swelling subsides; and be sure to flux blood of the vein; and begin to move the limb around the bone and in the cavity.</end_of_turn
And this is according to two methods of operation.</end_of_turn
And one of the methods is that you insert the bone with a straight incision like this, and this is its form: And then administer another incision of a little more wide than the first; and this is its form:
And then administer even more of the wider incision.</end_of_turn
The sovereign shall declare his name to the scribes, for some of them are more learned than others; and some of them are more brief than others and are at the rear of the order of their limbs, and they are of iron or venomous.
And use of them allows for easy percussion on the scribes so that they do not bruise the head and cause them to bleed.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then cover that you perform the puncture around it while you administer the scribes, which are named superficial not profound
And they are not called thus except when those that do not stop the limit of the bone towards that which is adjacent to them, for when the puncture is round about the limb or margin over that which is left, the head of the limb appears like a margin or a small circle, which prohibits it from being immersed and passing the spiciness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take a great number of these superficial punctures of which some will please the spiciness of each bone, except when in all tests of the head the limb which is acute in length and shortness is that of which you are now speaking
And this is the form of three species of punctures: The quality of puncturing around the fractured bone is that you pause the puncture on the bone and rotate that around the toes until you know that the bone is already pierced; and then change the puncture to another location and stop when there is between every fracture the quantity of the thickness of the ray or around it.
And so it is appropriate to touch the scribes between every fracture of the bone, and make them more subtle than you would over that in order to lift it, as we have said, until you have extracted the bone, or with your hand, or by any other cause that may cause them to be stirred, as for example nails and fine forceps
And know that you must take great care that the scribe does not touch any cause of swelling.
Therefore when the bone is pierced around, and if it is separate from the swelling if it is continued with it, and when you have extracted it, know that you must grasp and hold that which is in the roughness of it from that which is in the bone like another puncture, but indeed that it should be more tense and more subtle than the others.
And if there remain any small pieces of bones and cartilages, then take that with ease with what is due from the pains; and indeed take care of the wound with liniment and ointments that we have mentioned
And another manner of operation is light, long and laborious, which is to dissect Gualia and the heel for great healing; and this is the saying of it: It is necessary for you at the beginning to uncover the part of the bone in the location of the fracture which is the most acute and most obvious, until when you have discovered that part and you have stopped leaving the limb of that puncture slow and joyful of which this is the form:
And that the flat part is round and does not touch any cause, and the acute part is of it in two layers from front to back, as often as not; that the flat part be adjusted to the swelling with the face of the acutely incident part on the bone.
And so pierce about the puncture with a slight blow so that you can rotate it easily, and you must be sure of the safety that it does not happen by chance that you fear in any manner, and if the physician was the most learned of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, and if he was sleeping
And if there remains any attached cause to the bone of the knuckle in any location of the bone, puncture that with the limb of the puncture that is flat, and deliver that with ease, because it is delivered from it without document and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate into the pulp, and that which is broken off or remains of the bone is the face of it, and remains in it roughness and cartilages subtle, then know that you must grasp that roughness and extract those cartilages with subtle reasons for which you have prepared a number, of various quantities so that you can manage them in all locations in the most convenient way and the most subtle of them according to what you lose in your operation that broken bone and the figure of it.
And know that you must administer at your ratio with which reasons the bone at the beginning of the most lateral of those reasons, and indeed use that which is of the most subtle of them, and do not cease until you have finished administering the most tense and the most subtle of all of them.
Indeed in any other small fractures capillary and slight fracture subtle, know that you must take care according to what you lose for the rectification of it
For it is not hidden that all those who have studied in that art. And thus we stand upon what has been shown to us in great fractures.
If the swelling is rectangular when you extract the bone, then take as much of the limb as is necessary according to the extent of the plague, and immerse that in oil of rosemary, and place that over the orifice of the plague; and then take another bandage doubled or tripled and immerse it in wine and oil of rosemary and place that over the first bandage and do so until the pus comes out readily from that, that you do not damage the flesh; and then apply about that some unguents, and do not tighten that except for the extent of the plague alone.
And leave that for a day or two until you are certain that the swelling has subsided; and then remove that and administer medicines which are useful for drying, such as rue seeds and barley flour, and powdered gentian and arnica, and like those.
And it is that you grind these medicines into powder that is spread over the plague; and generally, administer all medicines of proven property that will stop bleeding and not cause death
And take care that the plague in your care does not become worse; and do not put anything greasy on it; neither leave it uncovered; for when it is adjusted upon the bone of the brain, it corrupts that and brings about death, and brings about that which is malicious.
And do the same in the head, as when it is modified by the bone and especially when its care is diminished, and is black in its surface; and therefore consider that if an accident occurs to the patient during the treatment of the plague, that is pernicious in its entirety
And if no accident occurs except for the medicine that is being discontinued, and it is in virtue of that medicine that makes that blackness, then take a little more of that medicine and a little more of rosemary oil three parts. and put on that some bandage, and place that over the wound; and care for that with the spices of treatment that you consider until it is healed.</start_of_turn>

Of the restoration of the nose when it is fractured.</start_of_turn
Know that the nose is not fractured but rather two pieces are separated with abundant pus so that in it there are two bones, for the part left is cartilaginous and is not fractured and does not cause it any harm but rather itching and torment and swelling.</start_of_turn
May it even be fractured one of the two parts of the nose, then you must insert little by little in the ditch of the nose that engulfs that fracture as much as the index finger and as much as the thumb, until the nose returns to its natural figure.</start_of_turn And it is done for you to facilitate this, and take care that you do not cause him any pain during that treatment of the patient.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture is in the soft part of the nose, and you say that it is not for this, then you must make it equal to the extremity of the ray where the smallness is.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture is in two parts, then do the same for that.</start_of_turn
And keep the restoration of it on the first day of the fracture if possible; and if not, then leave it for six days or eight days so that you can give it time to heal.</start_of_turn
And insert in the extremity of the nose a bandage of linen, if the fracture is in one part, or two collars, if the fracture is in two parts, and the collar has the thickness of such quantity that it fills the ditch of the nose.</start_of_turn
And say to the former restorers that the collars should be bound on the edge, and should be changed throughout the day, even though I do not see it; because you must know that the bandage should be bound with moist hemp soaked in vinegar with powdered oatmeal.
And some people put sponges inside the nose instead of a collar, because of the increase of pus which is enveloped in linen; and that you know that the fracture of the nose is very severe and that the patient is not prohibited from inspiration.
This is not necessary for you; and if you want, do this, and if you want, do that.</start_of_turn>
And if another sponge comes out during treatment, cover the nose with cerate or coat it with fat infused with wine and rosemary oil, or with diaperium.</start_of_turn
And if it does not come out during treatment, cover it with barley flour and powdered gentian with moist hemp soaked in vinegar; and place over that a lion, and do not lie the nose down for any reason.</start_of_turn
If even the bones of the nose are fractured in a small or large degree, it is necessary to make an incision above them, extract them with the instruments that are appropriate for them; and then close the incision, and care for that which encloses and consolidates, and apply appropriate plasters.
And if there is swelling in the nose, it is necessary to cure that by compressing it and administering lead canulas until it is completely healed.</end_of_turn>

On the restoration of the jaw when it is fractured.</end_of_turn
When the jaw is fractured and the fracture is not associated with swelling, it is necessary to assess if the fracture is displaced only, and not fractured in two parts and bent outwards. In this case, the pain is slight.</end_of_turn
Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth; and in the same way, if the fracture is on the left side, insert the index finger of the right hand; and push with both hands at the base of the fracture outwards, facilitating the displacement of the fragments.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture of the jaw has already separated into two parts, it is necessary to administer extension of the two parts according to the rectitude until it is possible to equalize them.</end_of_turn
And if there is displacement of teeth with fracture, extract those that you expect to remain whole with gold, silver or ivory; and then stop bleeding on the fractured jaw, and place a swab over the fracture twice, and over the large pulp correspondingly; and ligate that which is appropriate for the fracture, as it is bound.
Command the patient to rest and tranquility, and abstain from eating for a lion's share of days.</end_of_turn>
And if you see that the figure has already been altered in any way, cover it up and remove it on the third day; and then correct what has already been altered of it and plaster that which is left with powder of wheat, albumin of eggs, or oatmeal, because you do not want to leave anything else of it uncovered, and cover with a linen bandage.</end_of_turn
And when it is fixed and adjusted that plaster on it, and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it as it is, do not remove it until it is healed and the fracture is strong; for if the swelling of this fracture is not reduced in three periods.</end_of_turn
And if another swelling occurs afterwards, administer what has been said of the swelling in the peace of it until it is healed, and remove that swelling.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture is associated with swelling, consider if it is a simple fracture of the bone or a dislocation, for in this case you are recommended to leave those dislocations until they are resolved with those which cause them.</end_of_turn
And if the wound is narrow, expand it with the flebotomy according to the quantity of your need.</end_of_turn
And when you have finished removing those dislocations, and of those which you do not remove, close the wound if it is wide; otherwise, place over that one of the plasters that is appropriate and consolidate that which is left, until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter V.</end_of_turn
On the restoration of the collarbone when it is fractured.</end_of_turn
The fracture of the collarbone is usually caused by damage to the muscles on the front of the bone.</end_of_turn
For it is fractured, or separated, or separated into two parts which do not cause dislocations; and it is necessary to restore it; or if dislocations occur with it, it is difficult to restore it; or if the fracture is associated with swelling.</end_of_turn
And the operation in this case, when the fracture is associated with swelling, is that two assistants are present, one to support the fractured collarbone and the other to extend the shoulder on that side.</end_of_turn
And apply pressure to the fracture with the thumbs until the shape of it is restored according to what is appropriate, without leaving it excessively tense or flattened.</end_of_turn
And if you see more extension, cover the thumb of the patient with a pad or cloth, and make the size of it according to the quantity of your need; and extend and elevate the collarbone and cover the swelling with your hand until the fracture is resolved according to what is appropriate.</end_of_turn
If the thumb cannot be drawn out from the socket, so that it reaches the wrist, then cover that the patient should be supine on their neck, and place a cushion under their muscle.
The attendants according to the muscle of the thumb to the outside must elevate the bone of the thumb so that it reaches the wrist, and then you can rectify the fracture and bind what is between the thighs together
Even if you feel pain in the thumb and swelling, cover that you should lie over that area and extract those swellings easily
And if it is retained in the bone, cover that you make an incision of the thumb with one of the instruments which you have prepared, because you have already stopped the thumb from the pain that serves the wrist; and that pain is of the bone or of iron of which this is the form
It is similar to a wound of which this is the cavity; and its width according to what you need of it, according to the size of the bone or the thinness of it
The length of the incision should be as much as possible for the operation; that there be two extremities thus as many times, and that one extremity be broad and the other narrow
And if the disruption of the membrane which you have incised when you have extracted the swelling from the bone is wide, and you are sure of aftercare, cover that you adjust the two lips of the membrane together with suture.
And if the disruption is slight, or you fear aftercare, cover that you cover the membrane with gauze and powder according to the quantity of the wound of the membrane
And if aftercare is delayed, cover that you soak in warm oil and vinegar and oil, and rest over that area
All this, however, that the nail should not be seen over the broken bone; and so that you see the patient every day, because when the ligament is softened or the nail itself is already softened, cover that you rectify this and strengthen the bandage
And finally, keep the patient's foot elevated over the head, and leave the thumb resting on the foot for the night a little cushion; so that the adjutors of the thumb are elevated at the elevation of the muscle; or that the arm of the thumb is bound to the head of the thumb.
Do not remove the bandage if no accident has occurred in the place or aftercare, within twelve days.
And renew the plaster if you have seen the face of the wound to that, and adjust in the rigidity and restore that and leave until it is restored and the fracture of the thumb is coagulated
And is strong and comfortable according to the month in xxviii days, and some herbs in several homes is useful in a month of that time.

Treatment of Thumb Fractures
The thumb bone is broken in the middle part of the joint and not at the edges.
And therefore when it is broken in the middle of the joint – and it is broken in the middle of the thumb – and it is not known except by touch, cover that according to the figure of the fracture force you to prepare it and reduce that according to the natural figure in every way that is possible for you to do
And put over the wound a plaster of broken wheat with an egg white and put a lion over it; and put a little powder around the wound; and put a little moisture around the nail of moderate size
If the nail is left with a cavity in some parts of the wound, cover that you cover that cavity with a lion, and put the nail equal again
Then draw down your hand with a long stroke from the constriction downwards towards the heel, without stretching the skin too tightly.
Consider the ligament in each part; and whenever it is seen to be softened, bind another one and stretch it equally so that it is neither too tight nor too loose
And hold the patient's thigh towards the side with your hand.
The spatula is restored in about xx days or in xxv
And when this number is completed, then you dissolve the ligament and know for certain that that which is from the bones from which you began is neither feared nor dissolved.</start_of_turn>
And if you proceed from the foot bone and leave the tendon behind, then you will split over it and leave it, and do as has been said in the fracture of the sadistic prominence of the scapula bone.</start_of_turn>

On the restoration of the fracture of the foot bone.</start_of_turn
The bones of the foot are fractured in the middle of their length, and this is where they must be broken; but their extremities must not be broken because they must remain whole and flexible.</start_of_turn
And as for the accidents of the foot when its middle is fractured, they are that it is inclined downwards towards the plantar part and causes great pain, difficulty in walking, coughing, vomiting and fainting; and is declared in the cavity of the fractured bone and is not concealed from the feeling.</start_of_turn
And the restoration of it is that you rest the patient on the two thighs, and place between the buttocks of the patient a cushion; and then press on the muscles of the foot, and adjust the ribs to the greatest extent of two ribs, and support them in the operation of it and in the equalization according to all the rules that are possible and convenient, until you restore the shape of the bone as it was before.</start_of_turn
And then pause over the plaster and bandage and pause over the dressing of soft gauze or cloth and their remnants in suspension; because you encase them in wax. And then support that which is above the fractured bone so that it is not bruised; and keep it bound according to the rounding of each ligament, and stretch that which is of stricture downwards; and consider the ligament at all times, and when it is softened stretch that one.</start_of_turn
And if necessary you cause a loosening of that, you must correct the inflammation or swelling, pain or prominence that occurs in the place, then you will cover it and remove that and rectify what has happened in such a way as to care for it; and then reduce the plaster, sometimes up to the face; and adjust the stricture so that it is healthy.</start_of_turn

On the restoration of the back when it is fractured.</start_of_turn
Know that the fracture of the ribs does not take place except in the hollow parts that follow the two; and as for the extremities of them from the front part, it does not cause them to curve inwards but only because of the cartilage.</start_of_turn And you must recognize that it is not hidden from the feeling that you must inquire about it according to what is said.</start_of_turn
And the restoration is just as to embrace the fracture according to what is said, except that it must be embraced according to that which covers it, and then support the fractured bone with a splint, if you do not wish for that.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture of the ribs is inclined downwards towards the plantar part, then it causes the patient great pain and puncture, just as if it were a puncture of that which has pleura, and because the bone puts on the membrane; and it causes difficulty in swallowing, coughing, vomiting and fainting; and this is of difficult care.</start_of_turn
And already the Ancients have devised in that way that it should not impede.</start_of_turn
And so they say: cover that you suspend food from the patient that generates inflammation and wind, so that the belly is not swollen and is extended, and the fracture is impeded from the parts outwards.</start_of_turn
May we avoid this so that it is not the cause of causing further pain; and if it has already happened, then you can help with that.</start_of_turn
And I say to you that the wind should be stopped and that you should take with forcitude; and it is like reasoning, but indeed it is feared that the wind will draw out the humors from the place because of the weakness.</start_of_turn
And he said to them: cover the wound with a bandage that is already submerged in oil, and let fine particles of alum between the ribs until it is full, that is, let the dressing adhere when it covers the wound again; and then let the pain be treated with the care of food and medicine.
And if it causes violent constriction of the pain that does not suffer, and you pierce it with a pointed needle, remember about the pain, for when you cover the wound, uncover the area around the fracture, and then stop that instrument which conserves the bowels, remembering that which precedes it, and that it facilitates the bones, and extract it.</end_of_turn>
And if it is great, we should suture the two lips of the wound, and cure that with plasters until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if it happens that there is swelling after the bath, then let your hand rest in olive oil and place it over the wound, and let the pain be treated with what covers the swelling after the bath.</end_of_turn>
And rest on the side on which you sleep, until it is healed.</end_of_turn>

Of the restoration of the fracture of the spine of the thigh and the heel.</end_of_turn>
In some cases the fracture occurs in the bones of the heel, and sometimes at the thigh bones. The spine bones are affected in the same way.</end_of_turn And when such things happen to some, and you wish to know if he is healed or not, consider that sometimes the wounds are more softened, but sometimes they are swollen and dead, and you cannot bend them or extend them or stretch them, and when you compress them with your fingers or prick them with a needle and you do not feel pain in them, then you know that he is not healed, and in these matters of disposition it is deadly.</end_of_turn
And if you see that and feel that constriction with your fingers and needle, then you know that the marrow of the bone is saved and that the pain will go away with care.</end_of_turn
And if you see the spine bones of the heel like that and you wish to know if he is healed or not, then consider the weight of his foot.</end_of_turn
Then sometimes when they are softened, the accident has occurred in the most important, and when you put your hand on the two thighs, you feel heat and swelling, and some people fall asleep on the two thighs and are unable to urinate, then you know that it is deadly, and do not work on his care.</end_of_turn
May it be that no other cause of these has occurred, the cause is better and lighter.</end_of_turn
And the care of them is that you perforate the wound with a cautery needle that rests over the fractured spine, with olive oil or with cold compresses of vinegar; place your hand over that until the wound is closed.</end_of_turn
And let us pause one of the comfortable plasters and put on that which binds; and command the patient to rest and be tranquil and not to sleep on the part where he feels pain until he is healed.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture has occurred from a fall or any other cause that has separated from it, then let us cover that with a bandage and keep that bone in place; and then suture the two lips of the wound, if it is great, and cure that with the care of the wound, until it is healed.</end_of_turn
But if it is fractured at the back of the thigh bone, and it is the end of the limb, then let us put our left hand over the buttock and grasp the fractured bone with the right hand as well as is possible; and then let us put on the bandage and plaster, if necessary, and keep that still.</end_of_turn
And if the heel bones are fractured in them, then let us rest over that, and keep that, and cure the wound with the care that precedes it until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter X.</end_of_turn
Of the restoration of the limb.</end_of_turn
The bones of the limb are often fractured, and if they are fractured, then the fracture is only a communication in the extremities of those and is inscribed in the length and declines towards the inward parts; and it happens that the patient feels pain in the area and punctures, and the limb is stupefied when it is fractured.</end_of_turn
And the restoration of them is that you extend your hand over that which is over the fracture in the shape of it.</end>
If the fracture is only in the extremity, then you must embrace that part as it is normally worn until it is put back into its natural position.
Even if the fracture is in the leg or is already drooping downwards, then you must make the patient lie on the abdomen until such time as you are ready to restore the fracture. And therefore when you have embraced that part, stop over the dressing, and then stop over the bandage of lint or wool, and strengthen it with a tight bandage over which you do not fear making points of fracture or removing the splinter
Embrace the concavity with that which is within that which supports the restriction according to equality, and command the patient to lie on their side or recline on their side as well
If blood vessels should happen to burst after the cautery, then you must stop the extension of the limb and the restoration of the limb until the blood vessel has clotted, and stop over it until that which is precedent has passed; and then return to the restoration of the limb, and strengthen it thus as before.
And if it should happen in the heel bones or they are fractured, then you must treat them
(The text ends abruptly here.)
On the restoration of the fracture of the adjunct.
The adjunct is that which is between the hip bone and the head of the femur
And if it is fractured, the restoration of the limb is in two ways, of which one is that you take a piece of bone of moderate size following this fashion:
And suspend it from the elevated place with two ligaments
And keep the patient lying on a seat; and then pull the fractured limb out from over the bone until it reaches the middle part of the limb from which the curvature of the limb is appended
And if there is any other serious cause, or if the limb is too stiff, extend the limb downwards; and the physician must place something that supports the fracture more firmly, until the fracture returns as it should
And the other way is that the patient be placed lying down on the neck and suspend the hand of the limb from the collarbone by a ligament; and command two assistants to hold one that supports the fracture on its sides; and the other to hold the limb; and each of them extend to their part.
And if you wish that the extension should be stronger, then strengthen over the fracture by a ligament and over that by another ligament, and each of the assistants extend their two parts.
Therefore if the fracture is close to the extremity of the muscle, cover that half of the ligament over the trochanter and the other over the fracture against the hipbone.
Similarly if the fracture is near the hipbone, cover that ligament over that place and over the hipbone
Embrace that which is easy and useful, and when it is sufficiently embraced as it should be, then strengthen that which is not blood clotted after the cautery
Even if blood vessels should burst after the cautery, then lay aside the restriction until the seventh day, and stop over it a bandage of wool and oil of rosemary until the blood vessel has clotted, and then strengthen that again
And the way to strengthen that is to place the plaster over the fracture, and then place a layer of lint around the plaster; and adjust the arm over that adjunct, and place your hand open over the muscle
And suspend the limb and strengthen over the adjunct the arm so that the arm is in place, if nothing else prevents it from any cause of the fractured bone
And use crutches.
And place over the fracture that staple which is stronger and sturdier than the others; and place between each staple the width of a finger, and the length of the staples according to the fracture in addition to three fingers from the whole part
And strengthen over the staples on the restriction which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And that your restriction over the location of the fracture be more straight And when the fracture is longer, the restriction is smaller
Therefore if sometimes the position of the staples and the restriction is as we have said at the hour when we restored the limb to its natural position, then you must do it.
If you fear an embolism, then leave the stricture and the stones inside for seven days as we have said.
If you consider the ligament in all parts for three days so that it does not become inflamed or swollen; or if food is prohibited in order to reach the limb by the action of the stricture; then rectify all this as we have said.</end_of_turn>
May be if you are confident that no cause of this will arise, then do not remove the ligament but keep it for three days or more.</end_of_turn>
And let the patient rest on the side of the bed, and the legs more so over the stomach.</end_of_turn
And pause over the attendants who are eating pork fat with ointment, and consider throughout the night or day that it is not deliated or dissolved the figure of the fractured limb, or that the ligament is softened, therefore rectify all this with your art.</end_of_turn
And pause food for the patient according to the order we have given more, except that food be soft at the beginning until it has been chewed; and the hour cover that the food be taken away from them.</end_of_turn
As for the custom of the attendants and the limb is that they be strengthened in forty days; and the hour cover that they be taken away and that bath and medicine be administered with the ones that rectify this.</end_of_turn>
And if the fracture is delayed, then do not remove the ligament and the stones before six weeks or two months.</end_of_turn

Restoration of a Fractured Arm.</start_of_turn
The arm consists of two bones which are called the ulna and the radius; of which the one is small, which is called the olecranon, and the other is large, which is that which is supported from behind the little finger, from the part beyond the wrist.</start_of_turn
And it is strong that only the large bone is fractured, or only the small, or both are fractured together.</start_of_turn
And when the small bone is fractured, the restoration of it is easy, and its healing is easier.</start_of_turn
And when the large bone is fractured behind the wrist, the fracture is bad, and the healing is difficult.</start_of_turn
And the worse of all is when both bones are fractured together.</start_of_turn
Therefore if the bone that is fractured is the small one outside, it is convenient for the doctor to restore it, which should be done with little extension until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if the large bone is fractured, the hour cover that you pause extension even more violently.</start_of_turn
And if both bones are fractured together, the hour cover that you must keep the limb still as much as possible.</start_of_turn
And you must keep the figure of the hand still during the restoration of it and the extension of it supported on a cushion, and that the thumb be lower than the other fingers, and the wrist be lower than the other fingers, and the patient be sitting on a cushion.</start_of_turn
And let there be a cushion under the arm or on the side of the arm, so that the patient does not move.</start_of_turn
And let the attendants extend the arm from the part beyond the wrist towards the shoulder or towards the ligament, and another attendant extend them in the same way.</start_of_turn
And the doctor should heal the bone until it is reduced according to the better figure that can be made.</start_of_turn
And if there is swelling of the bone, the hour perforates to reduce the whole limb in the socket with your art.</start_of_turn
And if there appears a separate swelling that makes you fear that it will not be healed, the hour must leave it and keep it as we have said before.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture is in the palm of the hand, and I have already said enough about this case, take care of that.</start_of_turn
And if an embolism occurs at the beginning of your restoration, the hour lays a bandage with a little rosemary and white wax, and let it be half between stiffness and softness, and strengthen the bandage over that which is over the stricture until the embolism is gone; and the hour leaves the bandage and pauses the plaster prepared from powdered gypsum with lime, and put on the stones; and let the stone which is placed over that fracture be more firm and strong.</start_of_turn
The bones of the arm bear witness in the greater abundance, or a fracture in one or two bones together.
And thus hold the stricture firmly over the fractured area more strongly and more urgently, and when more than one part above the fracture or below it should be stretched out a little more than before according to the recollection of the same in the beginning of the chapter.</end_of_turn>
And the cloths which cover the fracture should be soft and moist, not hard or rough, and the thread with which it is stitched should be strong enough either from itself or between the warp and weft, as we have recounted.</end_of_turn>
Consider the limb and the ligament nearby for a few days.</end_of_turn And if any cause occurs for which rectification is necessary, even as it happens to the limb, then cover that you may embrocate the limb with cold water until the itching subsides.</end_of_turn
And keep the limb still until it has recovered, and then remove the stricture.</end_of_turn>
And if the swelling has already subsided and the bone has already regained its shape and seems like this, then rectify everything with your skill.</end_of_turn
And consider also if the nourishment is prohibited to reach the limb due to excessive stricture, for it is necessary to soften that a little and leave it for a few days until the nourishment reaches it again, and strengthen that.</end_of_turn
If the patient has no other cause for the matters we have mentioned, then do not remove the dressing for about xx days or so.</end_of_turn
And thus suspend the patient's hand for their ability to move restlessly, and make them sleep on the bed two.</end_of_turn>
You know that this fracture is restored in xxx days or in xxxii days, or more likely in xxviii days, and all this according to the condition of the complications and the ability.</end_of_turn

On the restoration of fractures of the thumb and fingers.</end_of_turn>
You know that in the thumb and the fingers there is a fracture of the bones, and it does not happen to them except accompanied by soft tissue tears.</end_of_turn
And when the hand is fractured or there is an abrasion, then the patient must continue to fall and bend it lightly as before, and place their hand over that which is extended.</end_of_turn
And thus the minister extends the fractured bones, and the doctor should unite them until they are congruent with good union.</end_of_turn
And it is necessary to keep the dressing and bandage still, if not a cautery is necessary; and pause the star above according to the amount of the area, and you have already covered that with cloth.</end_of_turn
And if the break is in the lower parts of the palm, you must leave the palm of the hand relaxed, and command the patient to strengthen that which is their fractured thumb; strengthen that with a long bandage.</end_of_turn
And the star of the forearm must be applied to the palm so that the forearm is applied to the palm; and strengthen that as much as is necessary.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture is at the ends of the bones, then it is necessary to remove the star above and another star below in the palm, so that the hand is opened and closed; and then pause the stricture, even if the hand is rotated between the fingers with the ligaments.</end>
And if there is a fracture in one of the bones of the fingers, if it is said to be loose, then it should be united as much as is necessary and the palm must be strengthened if you wish, and if you want, pause the small ring finger to raise the fracture and not to break it.</end>
And if the fracture is in the other fingers, just as in the middle joint, or in the index, or in the ring, or in the little finger, then it should be united and bound with the finger to which it is related; or they should all be bound continuously, which is better; or pause over that small star as we have said above.</end
Consider in your restoration, and indeed that which opposes the custom — with the exception of the surgeon — with what is said to be caused by any of those things, according to the narration of these things.</end

De restauration de fractura del os de la coyssa.
The thigh bone being moved about is fractured and is declared to be converted to the surrounding parts and the sovereign pus.
And the restoration is done in this way that the ligament is stretched over the fracture and another ligament leaves the fracture, and the patient lies prone on the belly and on the face
Then the minister extends all the ligament to its quality according to the quality, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone
May be at the root of the thigh, but the ligament is properly placed to the nail at the fifth part, so that the extension is made there, and the other ligament leaves the fracture
Similarly, if the fracture is at the nail, then properly place the ligament to the nail and make the extension to the parts beyond
And the doctor should bite the bone on both sides as much as he can until he reduces that which is according to the natural shape; and the bone is united by good junction; the hour is that he stops applying pressure and performs stricture, if it does not happen to the limb afterwards And if it happens afterwards, the hour is that you leave it for a few days until the swelling subsides, and then you return to your care.
The stricture is like this: cover the fracture with a hard bandage, and bend it two or three times, and remove the excess; and then cover the wound until it reaches the hip and the root of the thigh.
And insert a long thread firmly between the thigh and the wound near the nail at the parts beyond, and bring the extremities of the thread from the part furthest from the sovereign pus to the two parts, and then roll over the wound and the thigh as much as the bandage allows
And stop on the thigh in the place of that fracture, and stop with two staples on the bone of the wound
And fill the space between the wound and the thigh with soft cloth, so that the stricture is coagulated
And begin to tighten the stricture firmly from the middle over the place of the fracture with three layers or four, and when you have advanced as much as you can along the ligament at the place of the fracture, your stricture is less and lighter and softer
And extend two ends of the thread to the parts beyond until it reaches the ankle, and strengthen both ends of the staples of the other part so that the ligament is not strained from the joint
And keep the stricture on for as long as this, so that no accident happens to the limb crooked or swelling or pus; and if any of these things happen, then immediately take it away and rectify what happened as soon as possible, as we have said above.</start_of_turn>
And if in the bone is bad of the bone which you put, then cover that as much as you can; and if not, go away from it and leave that, and care for what precedes the memory until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And many other things are strengthened in this fracture of the thigh as well as the nails, as we have said in the treatise and in the books.
But in the restoration of it in this way does not happen to the patient's lameness; and if it is restored alone, without applying the other bandage, it is necessary to clamp that from which the pulse comes from
And you know that the thigh is strengthened in forty days or a few months or a few weeks, and all this according to the diversity of the conditions and the other means.

Restoration of the fracture of the thigh bone.
You know that the fracture of the thigh bone is often accompanied by swelling, but it does not happen always with the movement of the limb
And if it happens to happen, the fracture is only a fissure or break in its parts, and that is from swelling or pus, and over that all is placed as it is with the feeling
And the restoration of it is in such a way that it is supported until it is reunited and joined as much as possible for equality and facility and manufacture
And pause pressure with plaster and pause over that round staple, if you command; and strengthen your stricture as much as is convenient
Considering all the precautions recommended in other fractures, such as the application of cautery and similar measures that oppose any unforeseen event until health is restored.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</start_of_turn>
If it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. Reduce the swelling or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.</start_of_turn>
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.</start_of_turn>
Considering all the precautions recommended in other fractures, such as the application of cautery and similar measures that oppose any unforeseen event until health is restored.</start_of_turn>
When both bones are fractured together, the limb is converted into many pieces.</start_of_turn>
When the smaller bone is fractured, the limb is converted into fragments.</start_of_turn
When the larger bone is fractured, the limb remains whole, and this is one of the causes of its not being recognized.</start_of_turn
And administer extension, equalization, and stitching of the fragments according to the healing.</start_of_turn
However, if the fracture of the limb is delayed and has many soft tissues attached, that the extension should be milder and more gentle, and relieve with your skill.</start_of_turn
In the limb there is any cause of operation on the forearm, and it is when you have healed the breaks and when the whole of the surrounding tissue has been restored, that you will take off the dressings that have been placed for the causes that have been mentioned above; apply grease of palm oil to those that require it, but do not be generous with the dressings, and let the length of these be according to the length of the limb and the degree of swelling.</start_of_turn
And cover each wound with two coverings according to their length, and place one over the part of the limb from one side and the other, and the other from the inside of the foot.</start_of_turn
And bind the two fragments in three places, at the two extremities and at the middle, so that the limb is prohibited from leaning to the right and left, and stays in a good position.</start_of_turn
And a plaster cast has already been administered according to the length of the limb; and keep the limb fixed in it so that it conserves any movement.</start_of_turn
Above all, cover more than enough what is in fracture, and when that is placed properly.</start_of_turn
Consider in every day the limb and study it carefully, and take care of it so that it avoids posturing, swelling or other causes resembling these; and when any of these causes occur, then remove it until it is healed.</start_of_turn

On the fracture of the ankle and the bones of the foot and the toes.</start_of_turn
The ankle does not usually fracture; however, the bones of the foot may fracture several times; and in the toes fractures are rare, and do not occur except in exceptional circumstances.</start_of_turn
And if the bones of the foot must fracture several times, and sometimes these bones must be elevated one upon the other, then place the patient's foot on the prepared earth as if going out.</start_of_turn
And place the other foot over what is elevated from those bones, and put on shoes, and bind, and heal those until they are reunited in the places.</start_of_turn
And place a plaster cast and stop displacement, and keep the belly of the foot a little higher than the two plastic heads.</start_of_turn
And strengthen that which has been stretched down, because you have covered that with cloth and other causes that indicate.</start_of_turn
And when three or four days have passed, remove the bandage, because you will find the bones united, or fractured or dislocated, and the operation in those is thus completed with cunning.</start_of_turn
However, if some of the toes are fractured, restore those, and bandage those as well as I have said and recommend for the restoration of the fingers of the hand.</start_of_turn And almost stop the nail to the third phalanges according to the length of the finger; and put a little pressure on it; and then leave the foot on the table which is recommended to you, and stretch that which is strictured downwards.
Maybe if the nail is fractured from two or three places or more, then you must stop over every fingernail and hold it by the amount of its circumference enclosed in soft leather, and stretch the table at the bottom of the foot, and stand over one of the feet of the table so that the foot has good retention
And it is convenient for you to know that you must not forget the other causes which we have mentioned in other fractures of the accidents which we have mentioned; and be cautious of any other ailment that may coexist with this.

Of fracture of the bone of the thigh and of the fifth metatarsal bone and of the heel of the foot.</start_of_turn>
When the bone of the thigh is fractured, then cease in the crease of the knee, and lean that towards the side of the two with a little pressure, and keep it pressed from behind.</start_of_turn
And almost fill the wound of the knee with a pad, and make a point in the bone of the knee as expected; and elevate the two of them little by little, so that everything that is outside is forgotten until the part of the bone that was broken is returned.</start_of_turn
And almost put powder on the two of them, and when you are finished urinating, massage the knee easily and gently, and reduce and return that according to the manner in which it was at the beginning, and almost return the powder at the beginning.</start_of_turn
And do this for seven days or until it is restored.</start_of_turn
And if you want, take once of these and stretch over the ankle of the foot a needle of ivory; and bring all the air out of the bladder into the bone of the foot, and almost squeeze in the needle until the bladder is inflated within the bone, because the fracture returns.</start_of_turn
And almost fill the wound and stay like that for several days as we have recommended, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And when the fifth metatarsal bone of the foot or the thigh bone is fractured, then administer in the restoration and healing of them what we have recommended for the ankle bone.</start_of_turn
And that which is fractured is not hidden in these principal fractures and that little debt, mainly to the one who is able to understand this book and me; for that fracture signifies to you in the greatest possibilities of recovery in the restoration and in the stretching of them, and therefore understand well.</start_of_turn
And in the heel of the foot when it is fractured, take guard of the skin, and put the heel in that; and almost stop over the covering of the wound, and cover it, and almost leave it for three days or so, and let it heal.</start_of_turn
Chapter XIX.</start_of_turn
Of the restoration of the fracture of the bones when it is inflamed.</start_of_turn
It is convenient in that in which the fracture has occurred with swelling, and especially if the bone is large like the bone of the thigh or the assistant, or similar to that, that you take care of it and apply compresses to that extent as much as the conditions of inflammation allow you or as the testifiers have testified.</start_of_turn
And if the swelling goes away, when the powder has been applied to it, cover that you keep the retention of them in any way that you can, if for another reason it is not present.</start_of_turn
And almost start to restore the fracture in that same day, and do not prolong that, if it does not happen afterwards.</start_of_turn
And if afterwards there happens a relapse, when you must leave the restoration of them until the relapse has passed, and do not approach it in the third day and the fourth of all, because you will cause other accidents.</start_of_turn
And if the fractured bone is prominent over the heel, when you must pierce to reduce that and equalize that with your hands as easily and as little extension as possible.</start_of_turn
And if the extension is not suitable for you and the equality of them with your thighs is difficult, when you must reduce that with your hands as much as possible; and that is a wound that is made with a needle, the length of which is of seven or eight and the width according to the amount of the swelling; and for this reason the doctor must take into consideration these three or four according to the amount that indicates in the care of all kinds of fracture.</start_of_turn
Be gentle, and let the patient rest in a slight degree of elevation so that the wound does not swell up during the operation.
Let the patient extend the limb to which the mark is made on the limbs; and let them rest of the limb from its root to its joints.
This is how it is done:
It is called “labre volentz atelarem” in Greek, so it is somewhat pale.
Because it must be suspended from the acute limb to the eminence of the limb
And put a pledget under it until the bone returns, and let it be equal to any incision
Therefore strive to equalize the limb fracture between them, and if the fractured limb is fragile, and you do not wish to cause further discomfort, then you must insert the limb of that bone until the instrument has the power to grasp it
Even if you are unable to reduce the bone completely as we have recommended, however, you must remove from the incisions those which cover the instruments which we have mentioned; or saw that which is with one of the saws in whatever way you are able.
And remove that which remains in the bone of asperities and small sores.
When the bone is reduced, and the patient experiences acute pain, then know that the bone has not been returned to its natural place; and then do whatever you can to comfort the patient greatly
When the restoration of the limb is complete which you have made to the bone, then immediately immerse the limb in black vinegar, and properly if it is summer, and do not place over the wound cerate or any other cause in which there is oil, for it causes it to swell up and decay
And immediately administer sponges at the time of the meal in addition to the restoration of the limb, and leave the wound uncovered until it has been sutured with needles and bandages according to the quantity of the wound
And take care that you do not tighten the wound at the fracture, for this may cause the limb to swell up like the fools of doctors, and cause greater discomfort to the patient, so be gentle. And if the limb is strict, soft, different from the stricture of other fractures.
If the wound is large or is a bad wound, and you fear that some mishap has occurred to those which we have recommended, and if there is pain in the place, then do not hesitate to remove the staples, but rather make a covering of gauze instead of needles and tighten it with those.
When a day or two has passed since the wound has begun to heal, if there is swelling in it, then take out the sponge which you had placed over that which you had previously poured over it, and immediately administer cold compresses, as it is customary for us to treat wounds, even with tetracycline and remaining like that.
Remind them that you must remove the ligament and consider the wound every day morning and evening until it is consolidated and stopped, and that the limb should be prepared in such a way that the swelling will go away from the limb to the joints without difficulty
If several days have passed since the wound has occurred, and it is neither consolidated nor separated from the limb by the swelling, then know that there is stagnation of the small vessels in it so that you must treat the wound immediately to prevent further damage to the wound And of those that remain separated remove those that cause pain and make the limb swell up, perforate it so that you can insert them as easily as possible.
If the wound happens to be black or green, or any other sign of corruption and putrefaction, then know that it is necessary to take action, or another kind of treatment, and that you must tell the chief physician about it.
And when you are dealing with something serious and you appear to be in the presence of a cripple: when the limb is fractured, consider the limb as if it were the limb of the patient and the limb of the assistant and remain like those of the great limbs, and do not presume to attract it, or to extract it, for that may cause death; have it stay in place until it has healed, for it is strong enough to fall by itself in about twenty or thirty days. And take care of the wound if you see it, and if you do not leave it alone

Of the care of nodules that happen in the aftermath of any fracture.
The nodules mentioned above appear in the healing process of fractures, mainly due to joint stiffness, and often impede the natural functioning of the limb; therefore, it is important to prevent excessive movement of the limb during treatment.</end_of_turn>
Considering if the nodule is recent, administer astringents such as aloes, and bruise, see, and touch, and mark with ink or paint; if you take some of these or all of them, and confirm that they are effective in stifling, or in spreading like glue, or in making the area around the nodule rigid.
Keep the limb still for several days; then remove the dressing and repeat the procedure until the nodule has subsided; or support the lamina of lead that hangs down, because lead has the property of healing all that is swollen in the limbs.</end_of_turn>
Even if the nodule is already solidified and hardened, if it is necessary to remove it, do so cautiously, and cut away the surrounding tissue, leaving only the solid part; remove any excess fat or soft tissue that remains until the wound has healed; care for the wound until it has healed completely.</end_of_turn>

Restoration of a fracture when the limb is restored and at this point the limb should be kept flexible according to its natural movement.</end_of_turn>
When a bone fracture has healed, and at this point the limb is flexible, the following causes may prevent proper healing: too much tension on the ligament and its surrounding tissue due to inadequate support; excessive stiffness of the ligaments, preventing proper nutrition to the limb; excessive swelling; abnormal movement at an inappropriate time; insufficient support in the patient's condition, or weakness in the limb.</end_of_turn
Care for the patient by giving them food and making them comfortable until their health has improved; administer baths; and make them drink wine and broth.
And keep the limb still to prevent the area from being deprived of nourishment, or to continue swelling with cold water, until the nourishment returns to its normal state.</end_of_turn>
(The provided text ends with additional medical advice and observations, but their translation is not included in this response.)</end_of_turn
Care for bones that have been fractured by keeping them immobilized until they have healed without causing them to move excessively.)
When a limb that has already healed undergoes further healing, there is risk of stiffness and swelling in the bone that has fractured; therefore, do not impede the natural movement of the limb, even if you see that the fractured part persists.
Indeed, many foolish doctors and healers have made mistakes in their practice, and this operation is not without great fear, for it is often fatal.</end_of_turn>
If the fracture and the nodule are recent, it is necessary to soak the limb in water with many soft herbs such as fennel, chamomile, and marjoram; or to apply plaster to the limb with plaster of Paris and balsam; or to apply poultice made of poppy seeds and oil of cedar, or to apply figs and lead powder and olive oil, or to put on greasy substances and bind the limb with linen thread like the ancient physicians do.</end_of_turn
Many wounds dissolve with prolonged use of the limb that is being treated, and should be given regular exercise at all times.</end_of_turn>
If the stiffness has already disappeared and has become firm and solidified, it is necessary to treat it with iron, because this is when the pus becomes detached and the fracture heals; it is necessary to remove the surplus of soft tissue and bone that remains under the skin, and to administer medicine that facilitates healing in this area.</end_of_turn

The provided text does not include any information regarding dislocation, so I am unable to provide a translation for this section.</end_of_turn
Dislocation is the abnormal displacement of any joint in the limb, causing it to become immobile, and is accompanied by pain and great damage to the surrounding tissues.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs, it is necessary to seek medical attention as soon as possible to reduce the dislocation without delay, as if it is delayed, the limb is deformed and the dislocation becomes more difficult to reduce.</end_of_turn
And let me remind you not to move or stretch at the time of elimination, because the moisture seen during that time can cause spasms and pain in the lower parts.
When it happens, let me tell you to keep still during the emptying of the bowels, and immediately place your hand inside until you restore the elimination; then keep the limbs well-covered with warm water and oil, and reduce with ease.</end_of_turn>
And all parts should be treated with the water from which the recollection will arise in this area.</end_of_turn>

Treatment of dislocation of the jaw bone.</start_of_turn
Both jaws are dislocated if they are not quickly treated; and the dislocation of both is usually caused in two ways: either they are loosely displaced from their places for little movement, or they are completely dislocated and complete, until they are softened at the junction before saliva from the bowels comes out and it does not want to open the mouth or swallow, and the tongue is wrapped around in its saliva.</start_of_turn
When the dislocation is slight, it usually returns by itself without any cause.</start_of_turn
When the dislocation is complete and complex, let me tell you that it must be treated with reduction as soon as possible, and must not be delayed.</start_of_turn
And the minister should hold the patient's body, and the doctor should put his thumb of his right hand on the root of the dislocation of the jaw outwards from the mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or put both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and order the patient to stop opening their jaws and to swallow what is in their mouths; and the doctor should gently restrain the jaw and bandage the jaw until it returns to its place.</start_of_turn
If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are simultaneously dislocated, let me tell you to administer vaporization with warm water and oil, until the reduction of both has been achieved and is not delayed, as we have said.</start_of_turn
When they return and are softened, close the patient's mouth and do not soften them, let me tell you to stop over those grains of barley around the cheek, and apply wax and oil; and hold them firmly with ease.</start_of_turn
Let the patient sleep on their two sides, with their head resting between two cushions, so that neither the right side nor the left side is strained; do not force them to swallow anything further; have the patient abstain from eating anything until the pains have subsided and the jaws are no longer clenched, and when the pain has gone.</start_of_turn
And let me remind you to administer with ease, and do not irritate the opening of the mouth by eating and drinking and speaking, until the jaw is healed and restored.</start_of_turn
And if the reduction of two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at any time and is not completed at the usual places, let me tell you that moisture seen during this time can cause fever and persistent vomiting, and that it is very dangerous for the patient's belly, and is very bad and vomiting pure bile.</start_of_turn

On the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle.</start_of_turn>
You know that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, of which is one that it is dislocated at the level of the tibia to the level below.</start_of_turn
And the second is that it is dislocated above the muscle, which is what is usually done; and it is not dislocated at the back for the scapula; and it is not dislocated at the front for the nerves.</start_of_turn
Mostly it is dislocated and outwards at the lower end of the tibia, and more especially in those in whom the flesh is little, willingly it is dislocated; more in those in whom there is much flesh, it is outwards with difficulty.</start_of_turn
And very often in such cases of percussion or fall, the muscle of the limb is fractured by fracture, and is separated from its aponeurosis by fracture, and is cured in the same way as when it is already dislocated.</start_of_turn
Then when you have finished with this, when you are sure that the limb is sufficiently relaxed, then proceed with the treatment of the limb.</start_of_turn
And it is known that the dislocation of the limb is when it is at the lower end of the tibia; so that you must distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle, because you will find among these different appearances; and you will find on the head of the muscle a concavity and below the tibia towards the touch of the head of the muscle as if there were a ball, and to the patient it is not possible to reduce the hand to the hip without pain, or to move that without pain.</start_of_turn
If it is dislocated at the level of the toes or above, and you see that it is painful on touch, do not conceal it.</start_of_turn
And of this dislocation is useful a gentle reduction when it is fresh and the patient is young.</start_of_turn
And the reduction of the limb is that the minister raises the hand of the limb above the knee; and immediately place the toes below the tibia of the limb, and raise the joint forcefully to the hip joint, and the minister raises the hand of the limb and extends that; and immediately pause that so that it returns willingly.</start_of_turn
More if, although we have said that it does not return, nevertheless from the beginning of the dislocation, moving for several days, the patient should be bathed in lukewarm water and be administered embrocation that softens and smoothens as if it were ointment of high rank, and ruether, and meadowsweet in water, and be administered.</start_of_turn
And immediately put the patient to rest on the two hips and stop the tibia of the limb from moving until the swelling has gone down between elevation and traction, and immediately the doctor places a support under the thigh, and raises the head of the muscle forcefully, and grasps the hand of the patient so that it is not painful at the lower parts, and another minister holds the head of the patient, that it is not painful at the lower parts, for that reason both together must return to the hip joint.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, reduce in this manner: and that you see a man who is longer than the patient, and who is on that side, and insert the thigh muscle between the tibia of the patient and elevate the tibia to the level above that the patient is suspended in the air, and another minister grasps the hand of the patient from the lower parts of the thigh.</start_of_turn More if the patient is flexible, the hour that another cause is suspended, so that it is grave that the dislocation returns so soon.</start_of_turn
And it is reduced immediately in another manner: and that there be fixed on the ground a long staff whose head is rounded like a mortar pestle, which is neither thick nor thin, and immediately place it under the patient; because by placing the head of the staff over the drape of the loin, the patient is standing according to the length of the staff, and immediately extend the hand of the limb towards the lower parts of the other side; and extend the body of the limb from the other side with force, so that the joint returns to the hip joint quickly.</start_of_turn
And if it is difficult to reduce the limb for all the causes that we have said, the hour that you use this treatment: and that you take a staff whose quantity is as long as two cubits, and the breadth of it is four fingers, and the thickness of it is relieved in the groin of the tibia in this way:
And thus about the head of the patient, put a leather cushion to prevent it from being injured by the patient.
And thus, rest your hands from the patient's genitals, extend your hand or arm over the belly towards the thighs, and bind the belly against the attendants and arms and the tip of the hand.
And thus, rest your arms on a stool or bench according to the width, and extend your hand towards the thighs, and suspend the other limb from the other side, so that the joint is relaxed in all directions
And when the bowels are complete according to any way that you are able, and when you have covered that you rest from the genitals, hope that some liquid may remain in the belly; and thus prepare a plaster with meal powder and alum of lead over all the muscles, even if it is rotated downwards, and strengthen the genitals with stricture downwards; and the ligament is rotated over the plaster, and the hand of the patient is attached to the collar, and is laid, and do not touch the hand for seven days.
And thus keep the patient's food and drink small, until the limb is comforted, for it is more likely to recover quickly
And thus the food should be given more often every seven or eight days, or exercise should be performed; and thus if it is stopped and is not softened, the hour has already healed.</start_of_turn>
However, if the joint is dislocated, even if caused by humidity that affects it or for another reason, it is necessary to administer cautery three times, as it is said in the chapter of cautery.</start_of_turn>
And if all this has been done and seven days have passed, if the ligament has not been relapsed and the joint has not been arrested, and the plaster and the stricture have been reduced from it whatever has been raised, and it has not been arrested and cast off and cannot raise that limb towards the thighs, then know that the nerves of that limb, which are at the head of the muscle, are already insensitive or extended or softened, and that the joint will never be fixed in place again.</start_of_turn>
As for the dislocation of that which is useful to prevent the feet and the knee or the buttocks, the reduction is useful with impulse and extension with the greatest force, until it returns.</start_of_turn
And it should be administered in the other way, and take care that it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And if by chance the healing of the gravity in the limb is delayed and the movement of the limb is late, then the patient must make use of a cushion made of soft things until that gravity is alleviated and returns to its natural state.</start_of_turn

Of the care of the dislocation of the knee.</start_of_turn
You know that the knee joint is dislocated with difficulty and returns with difficulty; and that which is dislocated throughout is more especially at the front than at the back, and the dislocation of the limb is not hidden from you because it is seen from outside or from the touch according to what is dislocated, and when you have adjusted the knee dislocation from the socket, that is to say when you make it manifest, that the joint is concave and cannot bend the limb, nor touch any of the muscles.</start_of_turn
And thus keep the knee bent, and reduce the dislocation as much as possible until it returns to its place after the cautery has gone away, because if you see it after the cautery has gone away, the reduction is difficult, and it is not healed of all; and most especially when it is at the back, because it is worse of all the other kinds of dislocation, and of greater pain, and many soft things must be put on that in order to make it die.</start_of_turn
And the restoration of it, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the hand be extended with two hands, the arms be expanded, and the hands of the doctor be over the knee and hold it, and the plaster the joint with the nails of the thumbs, or at the root of the palm so that it returns to its place.</start_of_turn
And even if the dislocation is at the front, the hour returns just as much as it bends the hand with the hand, until it breaks the knee at the root of the palm.</start_of_turn
And if the dislocation does not obey the reduction, the hour gives violent extension and much force.</start_of_turn
And two assistants extend the arms, and hold that eye with two assistants so that it is not left behind during the extension.</start_of_turn
And thus rotate the arms throughout the part, because it is enveloped with soft matter folded long over the hand, or ligament.</start_of_turn
And when the doctor touches the joint with his hand, he should apply some oil to it so that these causes which help to lubricate the joint are facilitated; and then he should gently press the joint inwards until it returns.
And he should reduce the swelling that has occurred on the limb by applying a compress which is adhesive and exudes moisture from a paste of alum, and which should be removed with a tight dressing, and the arm should be suspended from the collarbone and left in place for several days.
And so if the joint is formed in the heel, then you should dissect the ligament of the ankle and leave it loose.</start_turn>
And if the joint is not too painful, then you should cover it with a plaster and leave the ligament in place, leaving it in for several days until it is removed; and then dissect it.</start_turn>
However, if the limb is affected by gravity during the reduction of the joint, and its condition is in motion, then administer moisture in broth and olive oil, and compress, until the swelling has subsided; or rest on the joint without movement, since it is an oily swelling; and then bind it, and leave it in place for the day and night.</start_turn And so on, put on the bath; and when the swelling subsides, then gently massage the joint with tempered friction, and then repeat the process once more, so that there is a total of three treatments.</start_turn Corruption has already spread throughout the bowels, within which it is limited.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, rest on the wound of the moist and scaly ulcer at the border and stretch over that; and perform several compresses, so that it becomes moist and reduces its swelling.</start_turn

On the care of dislocation of the limb, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand.</start_turn
When the hand bones are dislocated, the reduction of the dislocation is light; on the contrary to other joints, however, care must be taken in the reduction of the dislocation in the time that it is dislocated, since it may cause damage to the bone or that there is a fracture in it.</start_turn
And the reduction of the dislocation is that you place the hand of the patient on a table and extend the limb, and the doctor places his hand or palm on the imminent part of the joint, and gently press inwards until it returns to its original position.</start_turn
However, it must be considered if the palm is already bent inwards of the hand, then the patient should support two fingers of his hand on a table beside the extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is preexistent, you should support two fingers of the hand, since the hand of the doctor should be placed over that imminent part of the joint.</start_turn
And so if it returns well, it is good; and if not, then press that part with a plaster while giving up the fracture and leaving it; do not repeat this treatment until several days have passed.</start_turn
However, the joint must remain according to its flexibility; and do not notice to the patient any cause, but that the hand is softened and cannot withstand any cause; for it is understood that the nerves are cut or crushed, and that it is not strained in it except for the pressure of the treatment and the force that is given to it.</start_turn
Therefore when the limb is returned, then pause over it the plaster that has been recommended, and leave it and stretch it for five days; and then it should be dissected and left loose, and the hand should be exercised.</start_turn
And if there is still stiffness in it and any gravity occurs in it, then you should moisten that part with warm water and perform several compresses until it is relieved.</start_turn
Chapter XXIX.</start_turn
On the care of dislocation of the fingers.</start_turn
Some fingers are dislocated throughout.</start_turn
And when one of those fingers is dislocated at the base of the palm or at the root of the finger, then you should hold the finger still and gently press the dislocation back into place.</start_turn
And support the tip of the finger, suspend that beyond the part where it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.</start_turn
And so suspend it and extend it until it returns to its original position.</start_turn
When night comes, lie down as that story tells you, and do not cease to unbind that one in the day and exercise with movement, and lie down at night; and do this for several days until it is healed.
And do the same as before, if it is dislocated under the thumb, and lie down until that part is healed and do the first operation again, until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And do the same as before, if it is dislocated in other parts.</end_of_turn>

On the treatment of dislocation of the bones of the knee.</end_of_turn
When an accident happens to any of the bones of the knee or the ankle is dislocated completely, and so remain loose the bones of the limb, in that case there is no treatment, for death covers the patient.</end_of_turn
And a sign of this is that the evacuation of the patient is outside their will, and cannot be retained; and many times it is recommended to soften the limb by means of its veins or two incisions of its flesh, or one of these; or that one bone be broken, for in that case many times the bone must be broken and many times it must be broken for the evacuation to take place.</end_of_turn
Therefore that one is already broken at the back and is called gelboil.</end_of_turn
The treatment of these is that you consider if the gelboil comes from infancy, for in that case neither treatment nor healing is of any use.</end_of_turn
More often we see in cases of accident or percussion or even by suspicion that the Ancients speak of various methods of treatment, of which the most profitable return to profit; however, I already mentioned that little is known of most of them because of their excessive number, for my proximity to the understanding of their exposure, to which I have already alluded and from which I have learned much.
The only one that is cured of these is that which happens in the two bones themselves as I recommend.</end_of_turn
And let the patient be placed with his face downwards on a soft cushion of cloth, and extend from him the limb as much as possible so that it does not touch the bones of the foot.</end_of_turn
And place another support under the knee, fixed to the ground at the top of the limb, and another support outside the foot at the bottom of the limb.</end_of_turn
The minister has the support, and does not hold it fixed in the fossa; and another minister has the other in the same way.</end_of_turn
And cover the head of the patient with a bandage and leave the toes uncovered; extend the limb from the thigh to the foot support and hold it there; and do the same with the other limb from the hip to the foot.
And the ministers extend the limb to the support, and do not break both supports and the ligaments of the limbs in which they are placed, although indeed we have said this.</end_of_turn
And the doctor places his palms on the bone with force until it returns, or that he places them on a table, and that he adjusts under the table the feet of the patient until they return.</end_of_turn
If it does not return in this way, take a table whose breadth or length is three palms, and make a hole in the wall where we have said that it is proper for the patient to be placed a limb in which the limb of the table is inserted.</end_of_turn And place the heel of the table on the bone, the doctor places the feet of the patient on the other side, and gently pull until the bone is fractured and returns to its place.</end_of_turn>
And if you want, or turn it around with the hand; and stay on the ground with the head of the patient behind the knee of the two supports, the length of which is an arm, and place the head of the limb behind the knee of the limb outwards two supports; and the length is as much as between any two supports a palm, and there is already a break in any support in which the return is made, and that nothing is fixed on the ground so that it is not crushed.</end_of_turn
The joint pain is caused by cold humors that spread throughout the body, and when it affects the feet, doctors commonly call it gout.
And at the end of the limb is a joint in which the foot is formed, its length being equal to one palm from heel to toe; and in the two other thighs it is similar to this.
And now strengthen the ligaments that you have stretched in the patient's feet at the joint that is opposite their head, and the ligaments that you have stretched in the space between their thighs at the joint that is opposite their feet.
And now you must finish with each joint and appoint a minister who will support the joint with his hand, and the doctor will grasp the vertebra according to what has been said
Once the vertebra has been returned, and the limb has been grasped, then immediately place over the excision some ointment made from alum and vinegar, and cover it; and place over the ointment a bandage about three fingers wide or somewhat more, and the length of the bandage should be equal to the height of the swelling, and place it over the part of the vertebra that is below the head of the joint.
And so keep it bound with the ligament that we have mentioned, and use the patient a nourishing diet until they are healed
And if any swelling remains in the limb at the end of the healing process, then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and soothe the swelling, with the administration of alum; this has been recommended; and it is administered in that limb of lead lamina of lead.
In every case where there is suspicion of imminent dislocation of the bones of the two thighs, it is cured by that dislocation; and that is the bone which has already been mentioned as being in imminent danger of causing death if it should suffer further injury from this medicine.
Chapter XXXII
On the treatment of a dislocated hip
Know that the joint of the thigh and the joint of the muscle do not suffer only from dislocation, but also from other affections that affect the other joints of the limb distant from the head and with concavity.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, that is, to the back, to the front, to the upper part, or to the lower part
Mostly it is dislocated at the back, and rarely at the front or at the sides
A sign of dislocation at the back is that, when you adjust the limb of the healthy patient against the limb of the patient, the nail is longer and more prominent than in the healthy limb, the limb cannot bend its knee over the ankle, and the limb is limp from the knee downwards after a traumatic fall, because the head of the bone has already been fractured here
The sign of the dislocation at the front is that the injuries to it are contrary to this one.
The sign of dislocation at the upper part is that the limb expands slightly following the wound, however it does not bend where it is painful; and if you force it to bend there, it cannot go beyond that point; and the urine is retained and the feces are delayed, and you must walk the patient on the tiptoes
The sign of dislocation at the lower part is that it does not expand the limb, nor does it permit bending of that knee which bends the feces, the limb is shorter than the other, the feces are softened, and the head of the bone is below that point
More reduction of these species of dislocation is that you consider, in fact, if the dislocation is old and ancient, that it is already antiquated, and that you must not do anything about it; for in such a case it is not necessary to do so.
More in the case where the dislocation is recent, and is one of the four species of dislocation, then you must support the joint and extend it to the back and front, and also to the right and left, for that is what will cause it to return and will not require any other treatment.
More so, if it does not return in this way, then you must prepare strong ministers and extend the limb beyond the knee, or beyond the ankle, or over the ligament which is stretched over the limb; and another minister should grasp the hand of that side that holds the ankles and press with his thumbs the area of the limb; and strengthen with a grip the ligament over the hip, and have another minister hold the limb of the patient.
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And reduce the swelling or abscess to its concavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the abscess from bursting.
And extend all of them [the limbs] in a straight line until the patient is elevated above the ground and remains suspended
And this method of extension is common to all four [limbs].
And thus, if the dislocation returns to what has been said, it is good; but if not, it is necessary to apply some means of treatment as we have said before
In the reduction of it [the dislocation] itself, when it is dislocated, if the dislocation is to the front, cover that the patient is resuscitated over the buttock; and place your hand over the ligament at the root of the thigh in that place where between the head of the thigh and the place that remains to be extended.
And another minister should firmly press the patient's flanks, and measure the great toe of the painful thigh and extend it outwards by violent extension, so that that which returned to the proper place.
And this is the lightest treatment of the member that has been reduced compared to the other treatments<end_turn>
If it is excused from you and you do not obey the order concerning this treatment, then cover that both feet of the patient are firmly bound with strong ligatures, with care on both ankles and both knees.<end_turn>
And the length of each part is four fingers, and the painful limb is extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
And the patient should be suspended over the head of the bed, and that is in the greatest amount; and the length of the limb from the ground is the quantity of two thighs.
And order a strong boy to press the head of the thigh, and that it be suspended with the patient; and the other boy will press the thigh with force, so that the joint returns to its proper place with speed.
And in the reduction itself, when the dislocation is to the front, cover that the patient grasps about the heel according to what we have recommended in the former part; and tighten the ligament over the painful limb properly and over the foot of the limb.
And two cushions are placed, one under the foot, and the other under the head; and cushions are placed adjusted to the middle of the limb that is resting on which a damp cloth is wrapped, so that the patient is not wet because the cushion is between the patient's thighs, because from that the extension of the limbs outwards should not be violent.<end_turn>
And every minister extends their part, and the doctor with their hand grasps the reduction according to the art.<end_turn><end_turn>
And when the dislocation is to the front, cover that the limb is extended with care, as it is said above; and the doctor places the palm of their right hand over the painful area, and the other hand will compress that which is towards the other foot, and in that compression pause that which is extended outwards from the knee
And if the dislocation is to the back, cover that the patient is not extended outwards, but is elevated above the ground; having covered that it should be held firmly, even if the ankle is dislocated outwards, as we have said concerning the position of the limb; and it is on its face and the ligaments are extended, as we have said, without haste
And cover that a compress is administered to the area around the joint.
Therefore when the reduction is accomplished as we have said — and the sign of the reduction of the limb is not hidden from you, that is that you extend two limbs of the patient, and when you once again touch those cloths and the patient stretches their limb and expands that limb, you know that the limb according to what we have said has returned — and you adjust two cushions and hold tight and stretch with a bandage so that the ankle is not bruised in any of the parts; and keep the patient still for three days or four days.
And remove the ligament and the bandage, and compare one limb to the other.
When once those boils have burst in the garment, know that the dislocation has already ceased, and now let the patient depart.
And if there be any cause of swelling, then return it and cover it up, and extract it according to your first structure, and leave it for three days.</end_of_turn>
Then remove that, and make the patient walk slowly for a few days, until he is comforted.</end_of_turn
(The text continues with medical instructions and recommendations.)</end_of_turn>
On the care of dislocation of the elbow.</end_of_turn>
The elbow is dislocated in three ways, that is, it is dislocated at the outer parts, and at the inner parts, and at the lower parts towards the upper parts; but it is not dislocated at the front parts.</end_of_turn
And the sign of dislocation is that the patient applies his hand to the thigh; know that the elbow is dislocated.</end_of_turn
And the restoration of all these ways is that you make the patient move his limb, and if you can do this over what is necessary; bind his thigh to his face, and place his foot between his thighs; and in addition bind the elbow to his palms, and keep those between his thighs over the elbow.
And the sign of recovery is that his limb adheres to his thigh without laborious movement.</end_of_turn
Then cover that up and bind the limb to his thigh, and tie those together with a bandage for three days or four, and then remove those.</end_of_turn
Do not let the patient walk for several days, until he is healthy and comfortable.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if the dislocation has been reduced by you, know that it is excusable to administer strong extension to the ligaments from which it was preceded in the treatment of the hip.</end_of_turn
(The text continues with additional medical instructions and recommendations.)</end_of_turn
On the care of dislocation of the ankle.</end_of_turn
The ankle has some veins that are easily ligated for slight displacement, and some veins are dislocated according to custom, and the dislocation is caused either by the front parts or the back parts.</end_of_turn
The sign of dislocation is that sometimes the ankle swells up proceeding from the part to which it is dislocated.</end_of_turn
More importantly, the treatment for its displacement is of little reduction, that is, that it is easily extended with the toes flexed and is swollen up until it returns.</end_of_turn
More importantly, in the treatment of dislocation according to custom, make the patient move his limb, and keep that part firmly in place with a strong and valiant minister from the back of the two of those in the middle of his limb.</end_of_turn
And put your right hand on the great toe, and your left hand on the lower part of the foot in the place of the ankle.</end_of_turn
And pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and with your left hand for two veins, and extend with your left; and support the foot of the limb with your right hand beside the bandage work.</end_of_turn
Do as we have said above two veins.</end_of_turn
And support the foot of the limb with the bandage for the third vein, and you are at the ankle.</end_of_turn
Therefore, if it returns in one vein or two according to this method, and if sometimes the foot is swollen up, that is good; but if not, know that you must repeat the operation until it returns.</end_of_turn>
More importantly, if it is prohibited to reduce it in this way, make the patient walk on his toes over the earth, and loosen a bandage on the earth, and put a cushion between his thighs, and you have already bound him over his limb for so that he does not bruise the patient.</end_of_turn
And the minister of the limb has his thighs, and another minister extends the foot with his toes or with ligaments that lie over the ankle of the foot; and extend the other as much as possible against the extension of the knee, and the cushion is to exist between the patient's thighs to retain that.</end_of_turn
The doctor grasps the dislocation at the knee, while another attendant holds the healthy limb away from the area where the dislocation has occurred, allowing it to return easily.
Therefore, when the dislocation has returned and you have declared that the reduction is successful, then remove the plaster and gently stretch the limb, tying it firmly to the limb and the bandage.</end_of_turn>
And beware that you fear or guard the nerves that lie behind the heel, so that the ligament above does not become taut and that the limb does not become deformed.</end_of_turn
Then keep the limb still for two days or three; and if the ligament has softened, remove it.</end_of_turn>
And on the fourth day or the fifth, remove the dressing and prohibit the patient from bending for forty days.</end_of_turn> Even if it is necessary to go up and down that space, it is not harmful for safety that the dislocation is not dissolved or deformed, and that you do not neglect the treatment.</end_of_turn>
And if by any chance the patient has a relapse, cover that you administer in the cessation of the aforementioned narration, in another place of care and treatment, until it has healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter XLI.</end_of_turn>
On the treatment of dislocations of the toes.</end_of_turn
Therefore, that which is dislocated must be grasped with little traction, and what is not difficult, abstain from it.</end_of_turn
And if the dislocation is in the ankle bone of the two feet, then cover that you make the patient sit on the ground or on a table, and that he stays like that as if he were going.</end_of_turn
And keep your feet still, and place the limb over what you anticipate of the joints, and support that limb with the hand until it returns, and that you see that it has healed and does not reappear in the immediate area.</end_of_turn
And place under the foot of the limb a board that covers the whole foot, which has two caps, and support that limb with the hand so that it is stretched downwards and firm for three days; and then remove it and have the patient walk again for a month, until it is healed and the pain is gone.</end_of_turn
Chapter XLV.</end_of_turn
Of the species of dislocations that are caused by swelling or fracture or any other injury.</end>
When any of these causes occur, and you take care of the treatment and restoration of it, many people succeed in overcoming death.</end>
And for this, do not presume that you can provide care for it alone, but rather that one who is skilled in the art, with long experience, mercy and humility, should be taken into account; and let him use medicines at the beginning that do not cause relapse so soon, and let the patient be subject to divine judgment, rather than to that which you hope will bring health, except for the relief of the disease and the hope of salvation.</end> And therefore do your utmost to reduce it at the beginning of the disease, before relapse occurs.</end>
And if the limb returns as it should, then administer a regimen that does not cause relapse, and care for the swelling with the remedies that are appropriate for it.</end
And if the dislocation is in a fractured bone of the heel separated by a space, then you break the ligament of that, and do as we have said in the simple diseases of the joints above.</end
Beware and take precautions as you are able, according to your prudence, of that which precedes this, as I have foretold; for what is better for you than the Creator Himself, and more lasting to your glory, and more profitable in the end than all the rest.</end> Thus ends the discourse of Albucasim perfectly well, of which God be praised.</end Amen.</start_of_turn>
