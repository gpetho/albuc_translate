Chapter Five.
On Cauterizing Earaches.
If an earache occurs due to cold and is treated with laxatives and all the other treatments that we mentioned in the Classification, and the pain does not go away, then heat the cautery iron called "the point," which is pictured here.
Then, after heating it, cauterize with it around the entire ear, as you would circle it, or around both ears if the pain is in both.
And keep the cautery a little away from the base of the ear after marking the spot with ink, and the cauterization should be about ten dots in each ear, or thereabouts.  Then treat the spots until they heal, God willing.
