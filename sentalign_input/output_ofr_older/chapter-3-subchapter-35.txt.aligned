Of wounds and dislocations together	On the kinds of dislocation that accompany a wound or a fracture or both.	0.5059842
When a wound comes with the dislocation, and it is to be restored, many times the patient dies:	When anything of this kind happens and you attempt treatment and restoration, death is a frequent sequel.	0.49984568
So do not be presumptuous in the treatment if you are not wise in the art and have not practiced it long, and if you are not compassionate and merciful and cautious, not bold;	Therefore such treatment should be undertaken only by a person that is skilled in the art, has long experience, is dexterous, sympathetic, cautious, and not reckless or over-bold.	0.683596
And use at the beginning things that soothe hot abscesses, and leave the patient in the hands of God if you see no hope of healing; And when you see hope, set the limb back in place immediately, before the hot abscess occurs;	To begin with he should apply only remedies for the allaying of abscesses and then leave the patient to Divine providence, unless, of course, the injury is light enough to give some hope of his escaping death; in which case you should set out to reduce it at once before an abscess arise.	0.6927844
And when the limb is in place, administer things that soothe hot abscesses, and treat the wound as necessary with drying ointments;	If the part goes back as you wish, employ the treatment for allaying abscesses and dress the wound with suitable desiccant ointments.	0.6205282
And if there is a fracture with the dislocation, and small loose bones, remove them, and do as we have said for simple injuries;	If it be a dislocation with a fracture and there occur splintered fragments in the bone, try to remove them, following therein the instructions relating to the simple diseases we have mentioned before in their place.	0.74987036
And avoid acting out of fear, as I have said, for it will help you according to your Creator, and for the salvation of your soul and body. Amen	Use your utmost diligence; keep clear of entering upon a course with a dangerous outcome, as I have enjoined on you before. For this will best ensure the continuance of your prestige and safeguard your good name, God willing.	0.5534661
