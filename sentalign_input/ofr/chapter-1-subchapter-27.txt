When pain comes to the liver from cold and moisture and from great flatulence, so much so that it is forced out of its natural complexion by the superfluities;
and the patient is treated with what we have said in divisions, and it does not benefit him, so it is necessary that the patient be laid on his back;
and mark three cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity over the liver, below the hypochondria, there where the man's elbow reaches;
and have a space between each cautery the width of a finger;
and let the cauteries be along the length of the body, and do not press your hand very hard with the whole cautery;
and only burn half of the core, and let the patient stand upright on his feet;
and if he cannot, then he should lie down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms;
and this is the method:
And if you wish, cauterize these cauteries with a knife, if you are skillful and wise in the art, and be careful not to burn the whole core, for you would dry out the whole body;
and do not let it come to a boil, for the core is very delicate there, and know this for certain.
