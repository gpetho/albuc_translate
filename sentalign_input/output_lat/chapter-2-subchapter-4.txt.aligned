When lachrymation is chronic and arises from the external vessels on the cranium, nor does treatment by any kind of medical remedy have any effect, and you see the patient's features flushed, and he feels a creeping in his forehead like that of an ant, and his eyes are wasted and moist, and the roots of the lashes itch, and the eyelids are burned by the bitterness of the tears, the Ancients were compelled to treat it by this operation which they called 'treatment by the sword'.	When there are continuous tears, and their flow comes from the veins that are on the outside of the skull of the head: and no medical treatment is effective with medicines, and you see the face of the patient already reddened, and he feels movement in his forehead, like the movement of ants: and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that the hairs of them are already corroded with erosion: and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients used this procedure in their treatment, and they called it the treatment "with the Knife."	0.80655116
Beware of cutting the two arteries which are at the sides, and keep your hand away from the mandibular joint; and let there be a distance between each incision as of three fingers joined.	From the incision that is on the side of the temple, up to the second incision: and strip with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, with a tool, which is above the bone.	0.5395344
Then introduce the double-edged scalpel shaped thus through the incision near the temple to the middle incision, and with it pare off all the skin between the two incisions with the periosteum; then do the same from the middle incision to the third one; then draw out this scalpel and introduce into the first incision another instrument which is known as 'the knife-shaped': sharp on one side, smooth and blunt on the other, thus.	Then do the same also from the middle incision up to the second incision. Then remove this "spatumile," and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called the "sharp cutter," sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side. And this is its form.	0.7148196
The sharp edge of it should be turned upward to the subcutaneous tissue and the smooth edge toward the bone; then push it on to reach the middle incision and with it cut all the vessels passing from the head down toward the eyes, without letting the incision come through the outer skin.	And place its sharp side toward the flesh attached to the skin, and its smooth side toward the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle incision: and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision should continue up to what is visible of the skin.	0.81342643
Then do the same from the middle incision to the third.	Then do the same in the middle incision up to the other incision.	0.8518338

Over all put a pad soaked in wine and oil, or vinegar and oil, lest an effusion occur.	Then place in each incision a strip of old cotton, and place over them cushions soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar. And see to it that no hot swelling occurs.	0.73089457
