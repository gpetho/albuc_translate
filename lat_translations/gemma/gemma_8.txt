Praefatio.	Prefatory Note.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have finished with you, my son, this book, which is the most recent treatise on medicine that I have composed, together with its completion, I have reached the end of it through its exposition and statements. It seemed to me useful to complete it for you with this treatise which is a part of surgery, that is, of the art of healing with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since surgery with the hand lies low in our age and in our time, and has disappeared from our age, except for a few faint indications in ancient books which have been altered by the hands: and there has arisen from this a fault and hesitation, until the intention of these things has been closed and prolonged. It is necessary, therefore, that we should speak of this treatise in a way which is in accordance with the order of things, and with the declarations and brevity: and that we should come to an understanding of the forms of the instruments of surgery, such as the cautery and the rest of the instruments of the art, as is declared and as is necessary for their preparation.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why a good surgeon with his hand is not found in our time is this: because the art of medicine is long, and the author must exercise himself beforehand in the science of anatomy as Galen has said, until he knows the functions of the limbs, their forms, and their connections, and their separation and union, and the knowledge of bones, nerves, lacerations, and their number, and their emergence, and the pulse of the veins, and quietness, and the places of their exits
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	Just as Hippocrates said, a name is much praised, but the work is little, especially in the art of the hand
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have indeed spoken of this at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For he who is ignorant of the science which we have spoken of concerning anatomy, will not be saved, but will fall into an error which brings destruction to men: as I have seen many of them who form themselves in this science without knowledge and experiment.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	Since I have seen many doctors who have followed the old practice of applying poultices of wool soaked in vinegar to the scrofula in the neck of a woman, and have thereby caused the bursting of some arteries in the neck: whereupon the blood of the woman flowed until she died between their hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I have seen other doctors who have ventured to extract a stone from a bladder which was in process of bursting, and the stone was large
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So it came to pass that he extracted it with the bladder broken
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I myself was called to extract it: and I saw from the greatness of the stone and the condition of the patient that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I have seen another doctor who took charge of a case concerning a certain Duke of our land because of medicine: and there happened to a black slave who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the doctor, in his ignorance, bound the fracture with nails and splints, and tightened the bandage too tightly, and did not let the wound breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	He then died according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he sent him away for a few days, and commanded him not to move his ligament: and he remained thus until the swelling of his leg, and his foot, had subsided, and he perished
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I myself went to him: and I found that he had to move his ligament: and there was peace, and he was freed from his pains
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	Truly, corruption has been confirmed in the limb: and I am unable to restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	The corruption has ceased to progress in the limb, until it passes away
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And behold, another physician who has opened up a cancerous tumor: and it has ulcerated after days, until its malice has been increased with its master himself
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	For when a cancer is pure of melancholic humor, then it does not suffice to contend with it with all one’s might, except in the limb where it can be excised entirely
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And therefore, my son, you must know that an operation is divided into two parts: namely, the operation which is associated with health: and the operation which has peril in many situations
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have been instructed in all the places of this book concerning the operation in which there is fear and trembling
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore, you must be cautious with this, and be humble: so that they do not find fault with you for speaking too boldly, and for being dishonest.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Accept therefore measure with humility and protection, and the sick with facility and firmness, and use better methods which bring greater glory to God for the healing of souls and the praise of God: and banish from you terrible anxieties which bring fear to your soul, so that your faith and your comfort may be strengthened in you
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For truly, there remains in this world a greater glory to God, and a sublimity, and a great reward in the future for your souls.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Indeed, Galen has said in some of his instructions: "Medicus qui non operatur, operatur.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not be a physician of sickness: do not be called a physician of evil.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	I am therefore divided this treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Of Cautery with fire, and Cautery with acute medicine, Chapter, and arranged from the head to the feet, and concerning the forms of instruments, and materials for Cautery: and all that is necessary for an operation. ¶
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter Two
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Of incision and perforation, phlebotomy and injections, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and things of the like: and the whole Chapter, arranged concerning the forms of instruments. ¶
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter Three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration, and dislocation, and treatment of torsion, and like these: the head of the capital is ordered from the head to the feet, and the form of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory be to God.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	Book of Surgery by Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part I
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	On the Application of the Cautery, and the Dressing of Wounds: and in what complexions it is suitable, and when: and whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter I
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before we speak of any operation, we must mention the quality of the instruments and dressings which are to be used: and in what complexions they should be used
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say, that the discourse concerning the quality of the Cautery, and its dressing, is a lengthy, subtle, scientific, and secret discourse.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	And many wise men have spoken of this, and they have differed in their opinions: and indeed little will suffice of their discourses, fearing the length of the speech
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say, that the Cautery is useful in every complexion, whether with material or without material: except for two complexions, which are the hot complexion without material, and the dry complexion without material
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In the hot and dry complexion with material they disagree.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some indeed say that the Cautery is harmful in these
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others say the opposite, that is, that the Cautery is not suitable for scaldings, which are caused by heat and dryness: for the nature of fire is heat: and it is inappropriate to heal a burning with heat and dryness, with heat and dryness
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he said he who says the contrary: that with the Cauterium, the [substance] is an application in every hot and dry ailment which occurs in the bodies of men: for when you compare the body of a man and moisten it, to the nature of fire, you find the body of a man cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I myself have observed in experience that this is true.</start_of_turn>
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	It is not necessary to come before this, unless one has been trained in the last exercise of the Cauterium and has learned the diversity of the temperaments of men, and the causes and accidents of ailments, and the time of their occurrence.</start_of_turn>
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	From the rest, however, there is no fear: especially in cold and wet ailments.</start_of_turn
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For I have heard that all physicians agree concerning this: and they do not dissent from the use of the Cauterium in these.</start_of_turn>
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know this, sons, that from the secret of the treatment with Cauterium with fire, and the benefit of the Cauterium with burning medicine, is that fire is simple, whose action does not persist, except on the part which is cauterized: and it does no harm to any other part connected to it, except for a slight wound.</start_of_turn
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	Burning medicine, however, has an action that extends beyond the part that is cauterized: and perhaps it causes an aggravation of the pain in the member that is sick, and perhaps even death.</start_of_turn
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	Fire, however, because of its subtlety and the excellence of its substance, does not cause this, except in excess.</start_of_turn
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	I myself have learned this through experience, by the length of my service and my study with the art, and by the position of truth in things: and for this reason I make excuse for the length of this discourse.</start_of_turn
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it is not [permitted], because it is not lawful for this book of mine, I shall disclose to you a hidden secret in fire, and the quality of its operation in the bodies of its expulsion, which expels ailments by philosophical demonstration, agreeable to the minds of the wise.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	Know that even you dissenters of this age agree in the time when it is proper to make a cauterization, and that you prefer a better time for the patient.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	I say also that a cauterization is expedient at all times: for in every case the document becomes submerged in moisture as time passes, which is attracted by the cauterization
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	Above all, if the cauterization is for painful and necessary evils, strong, urgent, which do not tolerate delay: for they fear the evil which arises from the delay, which is greater than the slight damage done by the document in the course of time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	Do not let it be thought by the minds of the wise or you, my son, that because a cauterization does not always produce immediate results, it is therefore useless: for it alters the complexion and expels humors which are the cause of ailments.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	Truly, a cauterization surpasses medicine in speed of action, in the excellence of its operation, and in its sovereignty: and it is possible that a disease will vanish at some later time according to the complexion of the patient, and the location of the disease, and the excellence of the operation: and that which is prepared in the body from the collection of superfluous humors in that place, and from the like which are exhaled from the cautery itself, except in the case of an ailment in which the cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A slight ailment in a limb with little excess of humors, and moisture, like the cauterization of a tooth for pain, and the like of it, is possible that it will not return in this way after the pain has vanished.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that is done in few.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	However, the matter is in few.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But that is done in few.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	But that is done in few
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But that is done in few
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	But that is done in few
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	But that is done in few
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	But that is done in few
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	But that is done in few
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	But that is done in few
Caput II.	But that is done in few
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	But that is done in few
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is as follows: the diseased part is evacuated initially with the physician using a solution which softens the head for three nights, or four as required by the nature of the disease, its age, and its habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then command him to make a mark on the head with a needle.</start_of_turn>
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands, so that you can place your hands over his head.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm over the root of his nose between his eyes.</start_of_turn
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever the middle finger of your hand rests, that is the place to make the burn.</start_of_turn>
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then apply the Cauterium Olive: thus it is formed.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it over the marked place with the burn, with a gradual downward movement, until your hand is relaxed, and then withdraw it.</start_of_turn
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then lift your hand quickly and look at the place.</start_of_turn
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that the burn has reached the quantity of the head's hair or the quantity of herbs, then lift your hand.</start_of_turn>
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat the process with the iron alone, or with something else if it is cold: until you see the bone, as I have told you.</start_of_turn
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take something from salt, dissolve it in water, and drink it in this way: and apply it over the place: and leave it for three days.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then put on it a buttered bandage and remove the burn from the place, until the eschar is consumed by fire.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with four unguents until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	The more the wound remains open, the more pus it emits. It is better and more beneficial to drain it
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	Some people say that the skin should be cauterized until the bone is exposed: and let the Cauterium be retained until some degree of thickness of the bone is scorched
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then the wound is drained after that which has been dusted from the bone, and then it is cared for.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	Others say that the cautery should be continued until it leaves an imprint in the bone, so that the bone breaks, which is like the shape of a chisel: or the instrument which the women put inside the small letter A: and they say that from this place there escapes vapor of the head, and the wound is closed for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it is cared for until it is consolidated
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	I do not know of two kinds of Cautery that are absolutely harmless in all people, except for some who are timid in this matter.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And let me say that it is better for me to give up on this, for the safety of my own health
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	The head is weakened from the cessation of its natural motion: as we have testified in the rest of the limbs: and especially when the head is weak by nature: and the first kind of Cautery is more harmless and better for me in health, and more effective. Work therefore with this for the sake of health
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	In the case of cautering the head for the whole head.
Caput III.	Head section III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When there is chronic pain in the whole head: and it persists in the sick person, and when it is accompanied by fever, boils, carbuncles, oil and application of plaster
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	If, therefore, it has been cauterized with one cautery, as we have mentioned, and nothing else is applied to it: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	If the head of the patient is strong in natural formation and is not feeble, and if it suffers from intense cold: then cauterize with another cautery under the first.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize the very surface of the whole head with another cautery, without piercing the skin, and uncover the quantity of bone which we have mentioned
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize the head with one cautery at the back of the head, in the place which is called the uas: and this is the place where the marrow is placed. Lift up the head slightly in this place, and do not uncover the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the patient suffers from this intense cold because of this. And different from the pain of the other cauteries of the head is this.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I say concerning this: this is the cautery in its place. And it is necessary that it should be a cautery with which the horns of the head and the back of the head are cauterized, while the middle of the head is cauterized with a finer cautery.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	In a hemibrachial headache, whether with drugs or with iron, cauterize in this way.
Caput IIII.	Head section III.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When it happens that there is pain and swelling in a part of the head, or that the pain extends to the eye, and it is evacuated with physicians who apply cooling compresses to the head, and other treatment is administered as I have mentioned in the treatises on diseases, and nothing else is applied to it: then cauterization in this case is done in two ways: either with acute burning medicine or with iron
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	The cautery, however, with acute medicine that burns, is, that you take a tooth one of another, and excoriate it, and sever its extremities from two sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then split the place of pain in time with a wide incision, until there is under the skin in that place where the tooth is caught.</start_of_turn>
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Introduce it into that under the skin until it is hidden: then tighten above it with a thread of constriction of a moderate size, and leave it for fifteen hours. Then remove it, and discharge the wound for two days, or three: afterwards put over it a soaked bandage in butter, until the place has healed. Then care for it with unguent until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do this with some of the burning medicines which I have written about in the twelfth tractate, of Burning Medicines.</start_of_turn>
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	The cautery of it with iron is in this manner.</start_of_turn
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The cautery fire which has this shape.</start_of_turn
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called Clauilis: because its shape is like the shape of a key, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small protrusion.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then put it over the place, and hold your hand: and draw the iron gradually with velocity: and let the amount be such as is sufficient to burn from the thickness of the skin, like half of it.</start_of_turn
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And lift your hand, so that it is not burned by the artery below, which brings the blood flow.</start_of_turn
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the bandage in salt water, and put it over the place, and leave it for three days: then put the bandage with butter: afterwards care for it with unguent until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if necessary, cauterize this hemimanis with the second extremity of the Cauteris knife.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And cauterize from the artery incision in this hemimanis, not backwards as usual
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	Like cautering in the old hemimanis.
Caput V.	See section V
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat a hemimanis, when you have done what we said about treating the ailments beforehand, and what we said in the instructions for ailments, and the ailment has not vanished: if there is excessive pain, that which the first cauterization with medicine did not suffice, nor the cauterization with fire, then you must burn the Cauteris knife until it turns white when you apply it to the place of pain, where there is a line whose length is half of a finger, or almost like that: and put your hand away with the thumb and index finger together, and tighten it until you have pierced the artery, and hold it until you reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	But it is necessary to be careful not to burn the jawbone, which moves during chewing, lest you burn the cheek, or the nerve which moves itself, from which a spasm results
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be cautious, and take care of the flow of blood from the artery that has been severed
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in the severance of this there is fear, and especially for him who is ignorant of this and is not studious or experienced: and he dismisses the operation immediately
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come with the reminder of the management of the flow of blood in the event of an accident from the artery, according to my method, and in this place in this book
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If there is excessive pain, which this Cauterium does not suffice for, and if the patient's body tolerates the cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have said, then take care of the wound, until it is healed
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if necessary, administer the Cauterium, as we said in the chapter on the extraction of an artery with Cauterium having two blades.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	It is better to cauterize than to leave things as they are and cause more harm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	In the case of pain in the ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When it happens that in the ear there is pain from the cold, and it is treated with solutions, and the rest of the treatment that we mentioned in the previous chapter, and the pain is not relieved, then apply the Cauterium: and that is what is called the Punctum, which has this shape
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then burn the Punctum with this, around the whole ear, as it is turned: or around both sides, if the pain is in both
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And keep the Cauterium at a distance from the earlobe, after you have marked the place with the cautery: and let the quantity of the Cauterium be ten punctures in each ear, and as much
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then care for the place, until it heals
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	In the case of torture
Caput VII.	Chapter 7
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Torture which is cured by cautery is not except for those which arise from phlegmas, as we mentioned in the previous chapters
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And you must cauterize the kind which arises from dehydration and nerve spasm
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you have cured this kind of torture with urine and vomitings, and hiccups, and the pain does not depart, then you must burn the sick with three Cauteriums: one at the root of the ear, and the second a little lower from the earlobe, and the third at the junction of the two lips
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery from the opposite side of the lower part of the diseased area.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Since softening does not occur unless in the part which appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cautery is such that you cauterize with the cautery itself at the tip of the ear slightly below the horn of the head: and the other in the temple: the length of which should be according to the length of the thumb
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And lay your hand with the cautery until the quantity of middle thickness of the skin has been consumed by combustion
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, which is like a knife, the form of which is as follows: it is not too thick, like water, but not too thin, like air. The knife should be of a moderate thickness
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place, when you have finished: until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	In the ancient apoplexy, cauterize in this way: take a cautery of iron, and make a hole in the middle of the head, about the size of a barleycorn. Then pass the cautery over the surface of the wound until the blood has stopped bleeding
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When the ancient apoplexy has hardened, and when your medicine has not been of avail, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries over all the horns of his head, and with the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, and with the cautery in the nape of the neck, as we have said: and the manner of cautery should be as we have said.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	It is also cauterized with the cautery over the bones of the stomach: and this is the last remedy.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then take care of the patient, as we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	On the manner of cauterization in the Obliuione.
Caput IX.	On the manner of cauterization in the Obliuione.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	The burn should be performed first on the great hyera and then with sponge-sticks the brain should be supported.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then the head of the patient should be secured entirely, and over the crown place a skin-flap described in the treatise on skin-flaps: and put a little more of it over it
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This is indeed the method of cauterization: and do this according to the order which I have said above
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore the patient is cured by this, it is good
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then make him three burns on the back part of his head, which are descending from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye: and put between every burn the thickness of a finger
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then care for the burns, as has been said before.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If however you wish to add something, and the patient is tolerant of this: then make him a burn in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	If you wish to add something more: then burn him over the two horns
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then care for him, until he is cured: and keep the burn oil-soaked according to the form which has been mentioned.

Caput X.	On the manner of cauterization in Paralysis, and mollification
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is necessary to proceed in the mollification of the head with hyeras, and with that which we have mentioned before
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then burn the head of the patient: afterwards burn the middle of the head, and the burn over every horn of the head, and burn over the back of the neck, and three over the thyroid cartilage of the neck
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If, however, in an obstinate patient the mollification of the body is insufficient for several reasons, and the patient is able to tolerate it, and the disease is violent: then cauterize four times over the spinous processes of the back, and the last with the fourth, until it is consumed to the greatest extent from the surface of the skin, and elevate your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for it until it heals: and thus cauterize like Olive oil.

Caput XI.	Chapter XI.</start_of_turn>
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	Do not cauterize an epileptic unless there is phlegm in it.</start_of_turn>
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	It is necessary therefore that you should temper the brain of it in the first place with hellebore, and with the rest of the treatment as we have mentioned in the preceding section: when the patient is great, or is tolerant of the medicines.</start_of_turn
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	If, however, it is a boy, who does not tolerate the medicines, then is administered gargling and nourishing bites of food which temper the brain, many days before with good nourishment of the body.</start_of_turn
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then temper its head, afterwards cauterize it once in the middle of the head, as we have said before in this way: and cauterize once at the back of its head, and over every horn of its head.</start_of_turn
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	What if the patient is strong and tolerant? Then cauterize it with the cautery which I have mentioned in the case of paralysis, and the mollification of the body over the spinous processes of the neck and the spinous processes of the back: and let the Cautery be like Olive oil as has been said before.</start_of_turn
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	If the patient is a boy, then put the cautery on superficially, according to this method.</start_of_turn

Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the cause of melancholy is corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize with cautery, as we mentioned in paralysis-having
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	When the cause of melancholy is excess of declining humors causing melancholy, and the body of the patient is soft and humid, then take from him in the bath that which will temper his brain, as was mentioned before in the treatise: then burn the head of the patient, and make afterwards a circle of lead about the face, as a circle
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then put the cautery in the middle of the head: and the patient sitting upright is held fast from all sides
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then apply liniment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is better from old butter or oil.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And heat it over a moderate fire, as the finger can tolerate when it is introduced into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then evacuate it from the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it has cooled down
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do this to the patient every week once, with the rest of his treatment good, until he is healed
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you will, cauterize it by making many small points on it, besides that you hold the hand with the cautery: even if it smells badly.

When the water in the eye is declared to be finished by the signs which I mentioned in the preceding chapter, then you should begin and give the sick person the potion which will mend his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And keep him away from all moisture, and make him sit in a warm bath for a few days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then command him to raise his head, and cauterize in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	And cauterize above two temples with two cautery irons: if there is a discharge of water from both eyes at the same time: or from one side only, if there is a discharge of water from only one eye: and cut through with the cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin: and let there be cautery marks in them of the length of the temples: and burn from the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	And if anything else comes out from it, then immediately cut it out with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with my wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting of them, and the care of the flow of blood.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are ancient, tenacious: and are over the veins and arteries which are in the visible part of the head, it is verified that this is from the superfluities of cold, phlegmatic: then cauterize with the same cautery which I mentioned in the beginning of the discharge of water, the cautery in the middle of the head, and two cautery irons above two temples, and two cautery irons on the cheek under two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if digestion is inadequate, then cauterize it throughout all the sides cautiously around the eye, over the eyebrow's extremity with a small cautery.

Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you are treating this, when the medicine has not been of any avail: then cleanse it, and give him three baths at night: then rub the head of it, and cauterize it with an average cautery, with olive oil
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then cauterize it with two small cauteries, over the two eyebrows beneath the hair slightly

Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it over the two eyebrows slightly with two small cauteries in all parts: and stretch it out for two times: and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow: and do not touch your hand with the cautery, but rather according to the quantity that is to be cured of the third eyelid.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	This is the form of cautery like this moon-shaped cautery
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	And in the cautery of the eyelid when hair is coming away from the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery is of two kinds: either with fire or with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	But in cautery with fire, the patient must beforehand remove his hair, if there is any which moves over the area, until it is prolonged and equal.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If, however, the wound is upon his face: then bind his eyes with a bandage, so that they do not move, until they have healed
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they have healed and become equal, then place the patient's head in your lap: then mark upon the edge of his eyelids with the cautery, a sign which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the sign be close to the hair
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then put a soaked compress of alum or of hair-gum upon the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then burn the cautery, which has this shape.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then burn over the figure which you have drawn gradually in many places, until the surface of the skin is burnt, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, throughout
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the completion of your work is: if you touch the edge of the eyelid with your finger and pull out the hair at the puncture of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Pull out your hand then: and let him go in three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then put upon him a compress with butter, until the scab has disappeared.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with an unguent until he is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	But if some hair remains after an hour, and you soften the eyelids: then burn the cautery over the place once more, as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If, however, the hairs are in the lower part: then cauterize it itself, until it rises to its natural place: and make even that it does not prick the eyes.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	In such a case, cauterize with the burning medicine itself.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is necessary to command the sick person to discharge the hairs, until they grow long and become even.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make from parchment the shape of a leaf of Myrtle
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from soap that has been boiled, and from chalk not imbibed from one pound an ounce and a quarter or almost as much: then mix these together with good contrition, and make it with a little fire, so that it does not become cold
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then take from the pan the aforesaid over the parchment which you made like the shape of a Myrtle leaf, and put it on the eyelid of one, or both.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And put under the eye a little bit of soaked chickpea flour in albumin or oil: and the head of the sick person should be in your hand
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And put your finger on the medicine and press it gently.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you will move it whenever the sick person feels the biting of the medicine: for it will be as if it were fire
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	When therefore you have persevered with this and it has become evident that it bites, then withdraw the medicine and move it with your finger
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When the biting has ceased, then withdraw the medicine and wash the eye with water
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	Consider then, if the hair has been raised by the medicine, as it is raised with fire or with an incision, it is good: and if not, then repeat the medicine over the place where it does not stick, and do not remove it, until your operation is complete, and the eyes are closed together
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place above the very thing the ointment with butter until the covering layer of the wound is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then treat the thing with ointment, either soft or hard, until it heals.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	It is also necessary that you keep guard during the operation, lest something from the medicine should fall into the eye
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If after a few days the eyelids become soft and something from the hair gets into the eye, then repeat the medicine over the place which softens from the eyelids themselves, as you did at first
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat the thing until it heals.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	This is the form of the leaf of myrrh.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And you know that the eyes of men are diverse in size and shape
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore you must take this into consideration: and do not conceal the truth from the right way of doing things, which is the study of this art

Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	It should be concave, like the shape of a feather of a vulture from one extremity to the other, as the Cauterium is: and if you wish it to penetrate right through to the other extremity, or if you wish it to be superficial, do so as you please
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	It is better to grasp this concavity for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	If the swelling is open, express it out and remove the pus from it; if it is not open, then open it and remove its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then put upon it a cautery, which makes a cold flame.</start_of_turn>
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand close to the cautery from the eye to the nose, so that your hand does not go astray, or irritate the patient: and place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and burn it through.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If, therefore, you continue with the cautery from the beginning until the bone, it will be good.</start_of_turn
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat the cautery once, or twice if you do not digest it: and let it go on for three days.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then put on it butter with a bandage, and care for it with an ointment of desiccation, until it heals.</start_of_turn

Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	It is necessary to place above the eye of the patient a soaked cushion filled with wool or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	Lead therefore prevents the formation of the fistula, and promotes healing in a remarkable way.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is healed, as we have said with regard to the Cauterium and treatment, it is good
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	If not, it is necessary to perform a nasal perforation and reduce the fistula to the level of the nose, as it will be in its own place

When there is swelling in the root of the tooth, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then pus forms, and it breaks: afterwards it subsides, and pus flows, and a fistula is formed: then you must burn the cautery according to the quantity that is in the fistula

Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When tooth pain arises from cold, or if cold or worms are in it, and treatment does not suffice with physicians: then Cauterium is in it according to two methods: either Cauterium with butter, or cauterium with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	Cauterium, however, is with butter, as you take butter scraped off, and apply it to the cavity or the root of the tooth.</start_of_turn>
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take charcoal and apply it to the edge of the tooth.</start_of_turn>

Or if you wish, immerse wool or charcoal in cold butter, and place it on the painful tooth: and put on it a burning iron until the fire reaches the depth of the cavity of the tooth.</start_of_turn>
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	Cauterization with fire is also done, as you aim for the air bubble or the iron itself.</start_of_turn
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be something of size in it, so that the heat of the fire does not reach the sickly bone.</start_of_turn>
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then touch Cauterium, whose form will become evident: and place it on the tooth: and hold your hand until Cauterium cools down.</start_of_turn
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this several times, for pain will subside, either on the same day or the next day.</start_of_turn>
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.

When the strophes are from phlegm, and from cold humors, and do not obey digestion by medicines, and when you wish to speed up their digestion: then make a concaved cautery, whose form is as above
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open extremities, that the smoke of the cautery may escape from the other extremity: place the burning instrument above the other ulcer once, and a second time if necessary, until the depth of the ulcer has been reached
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the ulcer is small: then make the cautery according to the size of the ulcer

When the head of the assistant has been dislocated by the cause of dampness, and does not return to its place in the hour of its return from the dislocation: until it has become accustomed to the restoration of its place, then it must be displaced by a slight movement, as we have testified to this, then it is necessary that you reduce the dislocation at once.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the infirm person lies upon his back, or upon the side of his sound limb.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then elevate the skin which is inside the Tilili's area towards the upper part with your left hand: and if the dislocation has gone deep inside

And when it has been cauterized with a cauterium having three handles, then the shape of the cauterization will be six cauterizations: and these are the handles according to their slight tension
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the shape of the cauterium having three handles
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And when one is added over like this, so there are eight cauterizations in total.

Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then burn with three cautery instruments, a cautery beneath the breast of the cochleus measuring the breadth of a single digit with a cautery at the claw and with two cautery instruments below from two sides of the single cautery, until the triangular figure of the cautery instruments appears.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And lengthen between each other so that they do not join together when pus forms.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And the depth of the cautery should be equal to two-thirds of the thickness of the skin

And let the cautery be according to the length of the body of the rectum. And do not press your hand too much with the cautery
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of that which is absorbed from the thickness of the skin be not added to the middle quantity: and let the patient be standing on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	And if he is not standing, then let him be lying down, with his limbs extended and his arms elevated
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of cautery.

Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	Beware lest you go too far with the cautery, and burn the entire thickness of the skin, thereby causing damage to the whole body, and reaching the intestines: for the skin there is thin in those places, as you know well

When an evacuation occurs, and you wish to write, if that after-effect is in the liver itself, or in its membrane: if it is in the liver itself, the patient experiences pain and swelling without sharpness: and if it is in the membrane of the liver, with sharp pain which is severe: and know that I have already fatigued the physicians with their care of you
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	It is therefore necessary for the patient to lie on his belly
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then the figure of the after-effect with the cautery: then apply the cautery which is absorbed by the rays.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with this knife once, until the entire skin has been consumed, and has reached the intestines, until all the pus has gone out: then take care of the evacuation of the after-effects, until the patient is healed
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	Neither is it proper that any cautery should be used without having first studied the art of medicine to a sufficient extent, for it is by experience that the disorders which may arise in this way will be recognized: only then should such an operation be attempted.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	It is better to leave it alone than to attempt it myself
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the matter of cautery in the chest.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 1
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients say that cautery with aristolochia roots is used for a cold pleurisis in this way.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is, that you take from the dry roots of aristolochia some long ones, one of which is taken from that, and let it be as thick as the breadth of a finger
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then submerge it in fat: and light the thing on fire
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery at the place where the furcula joins the neck, and with two small cauteries under guidance somewhat less steep towards the part which is under the beard
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also at that place which is between the fifth and sixth ribs downwards to the back: and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauteries from behind: one at the place which is between the two angles: and two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, the lower cautery which is between the two angles.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And do not touch your hand with the cautery, but let it be evident that the skin is smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancient writers say that there are men who use a cautery like a nail of iron: they ignite it, and put it inside that which is between the ribs, until it is consumed with that until it comes out whole again, and comes out healed: as we said concerning the liver apostemata
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in such a perforation with the cautery there is fear, for either the infirm dies immediately, or the fistula occurs in a place where there is no healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	Concerning the cautery of the spleen or head of the pancreas.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you are treating a spleen ailment, given that in some cases the treatment of ailments causes a discharge, and your cure does not suffice, then the cautery is to be used in three ways, all of which are correct
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	The first is to make three cauteries, or four in line according to the length of the spleen following the pattern of the cauteries of the liver, which comes before it
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between every cautery the quantity of the breadth of a finger, or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the mode of the cautery be as we said concerning the cautery of the liver, equally
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	Do not press your hand down with the cautery: and let the infirm person recline on his back over his belly
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	Another method of cautery is: to take two fingers and grasp the skin which is directly over the spleen, where the elbow of the infirm person's left arm rests: and elevate the skin as much as the breadth of the body, so that the cauteries may fall according to the length of the body
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two fingers with the tips alight, until when the cautery has pierced the skin from the other side: then withdraw the cautery: four cauteries will remain
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to make a cautery with another having three fingers.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then take care of the cautery after you have finished with it, so that it does not emit pus for many days: for this is more harmful than all the rest which remain from the treatment
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	On the method of cauterizing in Hydrops.
Caput XXXIII.	On the method of cauterizing in Hydrops.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	Cauterization does not suffice in Hydrops, except when the area is properly asclitized.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you are treating Hydrops with methods of treatment which we mentioned in the discourse, and the condition does not yield, then it is necessary to cauterize the area four times around the navel, once on the stomach, once on the liver, and once on the spleen, and twice behind the ribs between the vertebrae, and once in the center of the chest, and once in the center of the abdomen: and let the extent of the cauterization be proportionate to the thickness of the skin
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then remove the cautery, so that pus may be emitted over a long time
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	Do not remove the patient from the treatment after cauterization: for two things must be done together: and it will quickly recover with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of cauterization which is used for the belly is elliptical: according as its shape: and the form which is used for the back is olive-shaped according as its shape
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	Method of cauterizing feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Method of cauterizing feet and legs
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When the swelling subsides in Hydrops, and the limb is filled with yellow fluid: it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the area between the heel and the ankle: and hold your hand with the cautery, and do not move it: then raise your hand: and do not move it at all
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	The yellow fluid will rise up: and the cautery should be in this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make over two crura two cauteria in every limb, and let the cautery be with the utmost limit of the knife: and let the cautery be according to the length of the limb, one under the knee and the other below the knee, round about the middle of the limb: and over every hip two cauteria. And let the cautery be drawn away open without treatment for a long time: that it may subside from it some water. And then treat the rest as we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Then make over two crura two cauteria in every limb, and let the cautery be at its utmost limit with the knife. Let the cautery be according to the length of the limb, one under the knee and the other below the knee, around the middle of the limb. And over every hip make two cauteria. Draw the cautery away open without treatment for a long time, so that some water may subside from it. Then treat the rest as before.
Caput XXXV.	Then make over two crura two cauteria in every limb, and let the cautery be with the utmost limit of the knife. Let the cautery be according to the length of the limb, one under the knee and the other below the knee, round about the middle of the limb: and over every hip two cauteria. And let the cautery be drawn away open without treatment for a long time: that it may subside from it some water. And then treat the rest as we have said.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the belly is from cold and humidity, until the heat of digestion is weakened and retained, which are in the stomach and intestines: and that is cured with the methods of treatment, and not by nature. And the healthy man tolerates the excessive heat of the cautery; then burn the belly with a large cautery over the navel, as it was done in the cautery of the stomach with the circular cautery, and four cauteries around the navel below the ribs, and a cautery over the navel above the large intestines, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if the liquid makes the excessive heat wet, and the patient tolerates it, then burn the belly with a cautery over the loin and a cautery over every ileum: and perhaps add two small cauteries near the large intestine.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	There is indeed a profitable treatment whose application does not err.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	There is indeed a profitable treatment whose application does not err.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter Six.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids in the rectum, either one or several, and they are of gross, cold, or humid matter, and they are cured by that which we have mentioned in the preceding discourse, and not by other means: then burn three times with cautery over the lower part of the spine under the almond-shaped prominence and triangularly, and burn under the navel as with two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is hardened, and his food does not digest, and his face is pale and spotted with pus, then burn him on the great stomach with a large cautery, as has been said before: and burn on his liver and on the spleen of the same, with the cautery of the nails: and leave the cautery open for some time: then care for him until he is healed
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	Chapter Seven.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter VII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you dissect the head, then you ignite the cautery which is absorbed by the substance.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the burning flame into the dissected head: and your last hand, until the cautery reaches the orifice of the vein from which blood flows: do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If there are many blood vessels in the head, then cauterize each one separately as we have said
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then take care that no blood escapes from the cauterized parts, until it is healed
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize with a large cautery over the wound, this is the greatest remedy for healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	Thus cauterize the fistula in the groin
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not obey the section and the work that we have said in its place, and recedes from it, perhaps it will heal with cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When this happens to a fistula, and it becomes old, pus flows from it, and the corrupted parts become wetted.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore it is necessary to explore it with a fine hook
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then recognize the depth of its cavity with the hook
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then ignite the cautery, which is like the flame.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then introduce the burning flame into the fistula and the amount in which the ligature entered
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cautery over the wound, until all the corrupted parts are consumed, once, twice, or three times, according to the necessity of your case
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard thee from the approach of madness, if it be there, or of great wounds: or if a fistula arise to the belly or to the intestine, then guard thee from all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do that except when a fistula is in a fleshy place: and think, for it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the place until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If however the place is sealed and is separated from the matter by that, and remains thus for a long time: then you know that it is already healed whole.</start_of_turn>
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if it is not separated from the matter by that, then you know that it is penetrating, or that a bone is corrupt in its depth, or as if from these it will arise in its place.</start_of_turn>

Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.</start_of_turn>
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When it happens in the Renes a pain from cold, or from great wind, and it diminishes because of that what is diseased, then it is necessary to cauterize it above the navel above the kidneys, with cautery over every kidney with a clamp, of which there is a reminder.</start_of_turn
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the same place.</start_of_turn
Quare uenient tria lineata.	For there will come three lines.</start_of_turn
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore there will be four last things in the treatment.</start_of_turn
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	Thus of cauterizing the Vesica.</start_of_turn
Caput XL.	Chapter XL.</start_of_turn
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When it happens in the Vesica a weakness, and softening from bad urine and moisture, until the sickly person does not retain urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the belly above the Vesica, where the hairs of the flanks begin, and cauterize from the right side of the belly and the other from the left of it: and let the length of the cautery on the side be according to the quantity of the node of the thumb: and cauterize with a lower burn, or with two burns, if you do not approve of that. And let it be according to what preceded the cautery clamp.</start_of_turn
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	How to cauterize the Matrix.
Caput XLI.	How to cauterize the Matrix.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When the Matrix becomes cold and moist, and is hindered by that from conception, and its blood vessels are corrupted, its menstruation is delayed, and there is pain in its vicinity. Then it is necessary to cauterize the area around the navel with three cautery instruments, as we said in the cauterization of the uterus, and to cauterize over the lower part of the navel, or to use two cautery instruments: and let the cautery be blunt.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	How to cauterize the Ancham in dislocation
Caput XLII.	How to cauterize the Ancham in dislocation
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the moisture of the mucus is discharged from the Ancham and becomes the cause of its displacement from its place: and the sign of that is when one thigh is prolonged over the other, when compared to the other leg: and the place of dislocation is found in that cavity
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it is necessary to cauterize the injured part above the Ancham with a cautery similar to a circle: when you have finished marking with the cautery around the circumference of the bone: as it is restored, and let the bone itself fall into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of the shape which preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	And if this cautery is not present, then cauterize it with three cautery instruments, with a large olive cautery: and make the depth of the cautery according to the quantity of the thickness of the whole skin
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	How to cauterize in Sciatica
Caput XLIII.	Head Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain arises in the heel of the ankle, due to cold and moisture: the physician must treat the patient as we have said in the preceding discourse, and not neglect the treatment. In such a case, it is necessary to expel the morbid humor from the body with large pills of foetid material, or with artificial pills, and the like.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.</start_of_turn>
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the mode of cautery in this case is by two methods: either with cautery and astringents, or with fire.</start_of_turn
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cautery with fire is in various methods.</start_of_turn
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of them is to cauterize over the heel of the ankle itself with three triangular cautery instruments, according to this form.</start_of_turn
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make the burn either deep or shallow.</start_of_turn
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space be such as exists between every two cauteries be equal to the breadth of a finger: and let the cautery be of olive oil.</start_of_turn
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	When the cautery is done in the middle over the heel of the ankle itself.</start_of_turn
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Four cautery instruments are necessary.</start_of_turn
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize in a circular fashion, whose form precedes the shaping of the dislocation of the ankle, one: so that it encloses the whole ankle.</start_of_turn
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the whole thickness of the skin.</start_of_turn
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the mode of cautery in Sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the ankle itself, and does not extend up to the knee and thigh.</start_of_turn
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If, however, it extends up to the hip and thigh, then burn it with two burnings over the hip, over the place where the patient feels the pain, where the pain is, and burn your branding iron four fingers wide at the outer side of the thigh: and let the branding iron be of the culter type.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the burn be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	Which if the patient feels that the pain extends up to almost the toes, then burn it there where he feels it with the cautery needle, three, four or more times, as he needs
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he feels the pain under the knee towards the thigh, then burn it there with one branding iron.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And take care in all your burnings that you do not reach the nerves or great artery, and do not pull over the diseased part with the branding iron, but rather leave it at rest
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	I also know of one and the other who have burnt the thigh and left it, and the leg was swollen, until the tumor had followed the foot and burst through, and corrupted the whole foot: then the solution came from the belly and the wound after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If the pain is in two parts together, burn both of them in this way.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men say concerning the cautery of an abscess, this is the way to do it.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make like a mark from iron whose diameter is half of the palm: and let it be at the side of its orifice according to the thickness of the kernel of the thumb, or less wide: and there let there be the third of its sameness inside it.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And there is space between every two fingers of the quantity of a thumb-node: and the fingers are open from two parts: and their height is like a node, or two nodes: and make a handle from iron adapted to the center of the fingers.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it is ignited in fire, until it is red, and it is sprinkled with sparks: then it is placed upon the bandage covering the healthy side over the wound
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Burn thus each three rounds with cautery in the juice one
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then remove it three days later.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Then apply butter: and remove the wound many days later.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment, until it heals
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, of this kind of cautery, or of the son of this kind, we do not use it much, because of the terror of its appearance: and because of this, few expect it over it
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	But it is true that from the good cautery there is relief to him who suffers, and it is found when there is its place.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	And the cautery with the physicians is useful, as you do two fingers having a hole in the arm, in which the bone of the wrist comes down from the air, or from iron, the length of the side: of which two nodes are in height, or as many as them
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And there is space between each two of the quantity of the breadth of a finger, and they are open beneath and above: and they contain themselves inside, according to this form
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place the palm upon the bandage covering the healthy side over the wound
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	Stretch your hand over the wound several times.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles of warm water, which is heated with gentle fire, and keep it for an hour: and the patient will tolerate the biting of its teeth, and the biting itself, for it finds biting like fire, until the biting subsides.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then lift up your hand with the instrument, and wash the wound with warm water and sweet water: then let it go for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put butter on it, until the black of the wound has disappeared: and let it go on for a few days, and pus will flow out of it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	This is the end of the treatment.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with unguents, until it is healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or the thigh: make for him a sitting position in which there is water, as you did over the wound itself
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	This is the way of warm water: and I have written about it in the treatise on the rectification of diseases
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali, and burnt lime of both kinds and take a part of each: put them into a new jar, of which the lower part is pierced with a small hole according to the quantity of the radius: and put under the bottom of the jar a jar filled with vinegar: and pour over it from sweet water, so that both are covered by a finger: and when you have pressed them with your hand, compress them well: and let go of the jar, until the acute water of the vinegar has descended from the treated part of the vinegar jar.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then mix in the whole water, and pour it over another lime: and let it rest, until it recovers
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	She herself is both strong and acute, and is administered in many medical operations, and in cauterization of the remainder of the limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Since she has the power to perform the operation of fire herself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And among the physicians are those who cauterize widely, as well as testicles, and almond oil, and chalk with soap, thus that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	Galenus himself, when narrating an ancient case, related that a certain physician had cured a pain in the groin and sciatica: and he praised her for her sharpness
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	He said that it did not require any other treatment, and that he was healed from a wound that had become gangrenous, so that when he left the bath he was already healed
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	It is as it is taken from a green man: and if it is not found green, take it dry, apply it frequently with some fat, and put it on the groin, where there is pain, or the thigh, or the hip: and bind it, and let it rest for the space of three hours, or for as long as the patient feels the pain diminishing
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then immerse her in a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When she becomes soft, introduce her into the basin.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain departs, and she is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that no other cautery should be used with these physicians except after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	Dioscorides also says that donkey dung, when cauterized with this, causes the sciatica to disappear: and it does this in this way
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take wool, soak it in old oil, and apply it to the deep place which is between the thumb of the foot and between the bones, and it is closer to the bone.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take the dry dung of asses and burn it in the fire until it is charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it over wool and let it go out, until it is extinguished
Deinde itera illud.	Do it again.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not cease to do this until sensation returns through the mediation of the sense of touch up to the edge, and the pain has ceased
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cauterization is called cauterization of the Vaccinum
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	Of the cauterization of the pain of the back
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When there is pain in the back from various causes, such as from swelling, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, or things of this nature, from the infusion of cold and moist matter: and the cauterization will not take effect except in this single kind, which is done by the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	It is necessary therefore after evacuation of the patient with foul pills and things of this nature to make three lines on the back where the pain is, as wide as the breadth of the palm of the hand, after making signs with the cautery in every line five times, or more according to the tolerance of the patient or the extent of his ailment: and make the cauterization with the cautery needle
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize three or four times with the middle caulking needle, according to this form.

Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This swelling often occurs in young children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of the beginning of this ailment in children is: when there is stiffness in the loin with elevation, and movement: and you find it in the last lumbar vertebra and its nodes, which begin to protrude over the rest of the vertebrae
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When you have finished with it and wish to do so, then burn it with a cautery in the shape of a circle according to this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	Burn the cautery equally over every part of the sponge: and if you wish to burn around the circumference of the sponge with the cautery, make two or three points close together

Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And be careful, lest you burn the sensitive area which is in spasm of the nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	In the case of podagra and joined pains.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the joined pains are caused by cold humors which flow upon every limb of the body, and when these cause pain in the feet, it is customary among physicians to call this podagra
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When the cold cause of podagra is cured with the proper methods and the pain does not vanish, then the cautery removes it.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is necessary to burn around the joint of the feet after emptying with multiple cauteries: and let the cautery be of Olive oil
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its form
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	Or if you do not wish to make holes on the face of the foot, then make it with the point of the cautery
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.

Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	Neither immerse your hand with the cautery, but rather keep the surrounding area somewhat moist.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If, however, pain should ascend to the knee and the back: then manage as we have said with the cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	If the pain is only in the hands, then prick around the focus as two lines are unrolled
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If, however, the pain remains from the digits, then prick over every node and the palm of the hand
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If, however, the pain should ascend after a day to the cubits or the shoulders, then burn both from every side
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	Neither must you neglect the patient from the good regimen, from the recovery of the physician.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regimen is done, and the phlegm is expelled, healing will take place with the help of God with this cautery.

When in some limb there is pain from a fall or blow, and the pain has lasted a long time without any remedy with doctors, then it is necessary to cauterize with a cautery of a Point

Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If, however, the leprosy is not severe, and the swelling decreases as we have said, and does not remain: and the time has come over the patient, who has grasped corruption over his whole face: then burn him on the crown of the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and the second below at the front near the end of the hair, and two on either side of the horns, and one at the back on the nape of the neck.</start_of_turn

Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	You know, the sickly man does not feel pain in cauterizing, just as the healthy do: therefore, because his body is already stunned
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.

Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better to cauterize around it with a circle, as we said: or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the manner of cauterizing in Adubelati
Caput LIII.	On the manner of cauterizing in Adubelati
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When anyone has Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturity, either because of excessive fat, or because of its great age, when it is decrepit and has little blood, or for a long time, and wishes to hasten its maturity: then cauterize around its circumference with many small cauteries puncturing
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then let go of him.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	Then let go of him. For he himself will hasten with his recovery.</start_of_turn>
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If however you wish to perforate him with a cautery, then ignite the cautery, for this is its form.</start_of_turn>
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place him in the middle of the Adubelati, until it pierces the skin: and let the cautery be from that which follows the patient, so that it may alleviate the course of the disease.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for him until he is healed.</start_of_turn
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	Thus cauterize in a moist ulcer.</start_of_turn
Caput LIIII.	Head LIIII.</start_of_turn
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	The ulcer is not other than a corruption in a movable limb, and it consumes it: as fire consumes dry wood.</start_of_turn
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you wish to cauterize the ulcer in a place where you can use fire with cautery, then ignite the cautery with many small and large flames, according to what will be suitable in the place where the ulcer is.</start_of_turn
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from all sides until you have eradicated the whole corruption, and let nothing remain of it remaining.</start_of_turn
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then let go of him three days, and place over the cauterized place sulfur dust with oil, until you have eradicated all the eschars and all the corruption.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for him with nourishing unguents for meat.</start_of_turn
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you wish, that after three days meat is born anew in a healthy state, in which there is no corruption, that is good.</start_of_turn
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cautery over that which remains of the corrupted places.</start_of_turn
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	The wounds are treated with acute medicine when necessary.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	Acute medicine is sometimes used in the treatment of wounds.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	Burning is faster with fire than with water: and I have already said that cauterization is used with acute medicine in wounds: take therefore care of it in this case when it is needed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	In the case of Clauis and Verucis, cauterize in this way.</start_of_turn
Caput LV.	The head of the bone is cauterized.</start_of_turn
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	Many times this painful affection occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a great, diffuse matter which affects the foot.</start_of_turn>
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	There are two ways to cauterize: with fire and with warm water.</start_of_turn
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	When you use fire, make the cauterization like the back of a feather: this is done with iron according to the quantity which contains the bone from all sides: and be careful of the edges.</start_of_turn
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then put the fire on the bone.</start_of_turn
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then withdraw the hand with the cautery round about the bone until the cauterization reaches the depth of the bone: and leave it for three days, until pus begins to discharge.</start_of_turn
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then cover it with sponges soaked in rue and salt: and leave the bandage on it at night.</start_of_turn
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	It will disappear from its roots.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place where the flesh has been burnt, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not overcome, and many times they appear on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then you must apply warm water cautery: taking a tube of air, or iron, or feather, and placing it on the bone, or over the ulcer.</start_of_turn
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then throw a small quantity of warm water into the cannula: hold your hand steady and withdraw the syringe with pressure on your hand, so that the mark of the needle may be impressed at the root of the claw, and that the warm water may reach the root of the claw: and the patient should expect relief somewhat after the hour of the warm water treatment.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then throw it away, for the claw is eradicated with its roots.</start_of_turn>
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do so once more after this, until you reach above all that is in the body from that which it is made.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then care for the place after they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from the blood vessels.</start_of_turn
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	In Tremore, cauterization is done in this way.</start_of_turn>
Caput LVI.	Chapter 66.</start_of_turn
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to anyone that a tremor arises from cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or from something else: then it is necessary to cauterize four times, or five over the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra cauterize, and cauterize in the chest, and cauterize over the stomach.</start_of_turn>
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	The tremor will subside with the cauterization of olive oil, and health will be restored to the cold sickness.</start_of_turn
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	Method of cauterization for Albathir.</start_of_turn
Caput LVII.	Chapter 67.</start_of_turn
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When there are expelled from the body of Albathir bad ulcers, that is, pus-filled pockets, which arise from corrupted thick material.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore it is necessary in the first place, when these appear, to cauterize over every head of the ulcers with a fine cautery with a twig of myrrh whose extremity is kindled with fire.</start_of_turn
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or as with the root of long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or as with the cautery of a lens
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes when cauterized, the pus comes out of itself in this way: and does not grow: and breaks through the superfluous matter making it thin, and heals from within.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	But it must be known that this must be done after the evacuation with a phlebotomy
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	Regarding the cautery of a vein in a wound
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Many times there happens the flow of blood from a vein that has been cut in a wound, which happens outside, or at the incision of the skin, or by cautery of a limb, and the like: and this makes it difficult to close it off
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When this happens to anyone, then do so with your hand at the opening of the vein, and place above it your index finger: and press it firmly, until the blood is held under your finger, and does not come out of it again
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put on the fire a small olive twig, and a great number more: and blow over them, until they are ignited somewhat
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take from the wound one, or a few, or many, according to the wound and the place, in which the vein has been broken, and place the cautery on the vein itself: and as soon as you have moved your finger away, hold the cautery in place, until the blood is closed off
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	And if it comes out when you remove your finger from the opening of the vein, and extinguish the cautery, then take another cautery quickly, from those which are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Do not cease to do this until the blood is severed.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	Beware lest you burn the nerve in that place and increase the pain of the ailment
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	You know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to sever it: especially when the artery is large, except with four fingers.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with the cautery, as we have said before
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or by extracting it, when it is not extracted
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its extremities are contracted, and the blood is severed.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is bound with strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or a medicine is placed upon it that has the property of severing blood, and it is bound with a tight constriction
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Whoever performs an incision with ligature and tightening with cloth, or with the application of burnings and the like, does not confer on it sufficient pain, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If, however, this happens to anyone and there is no physician present, neither medicine: then one should start by placing the index finger over the opening of the vein, as we have said before, and constrict it tightly, until the blood is choked from the upper part of the wound, and over the artery
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be moved, but should be held down with cold water or ice always, until the blood solidifies, and increases, and is severed
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile consider what is needed from the cautery, or from medicine

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in Wounds, and Similar Procedures.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have spoken in the first chapter concerning all ailments which are amenable to the cautery of fire and burning medicines, and the occasions when these are necessary, their causes, and their instruments, and the forms of cautery.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And following we shall treat of the chapters from the head down to the foot
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	I proceed in this chapter in the same manner: so as to satisfy the seeker of knowledge concerning this matter
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	Before I begin, it is necessary to tell you what is omitted from this chapter which is found in the first chapter concerning cautery.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	Therefore it is necessary to exercise great caution in this procedure, because in this chapter there is great bloodshed with blood vessels, with the result that there is great danger of swelling of the limb, or of wound, or of bursting of an abscess, or of bursting of an artery, or of fracture of a bone, or of similar occurrences, which are all accompanied by tremors, fear, and great loss of blood
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	I warn you, do not be afraid of this which is contained in hesitation, for indeed it is done in the art of man as in the art of healing the sick.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For such is the man who is enraged with his ailment: he is light in his blood: because of the greatness of his ailment and the length of his suffering
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And because of the fear which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And because he gives himself up to you, and tells you that he hopes for health, knowing that his ailment is pernicious
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	It is not proper that you consent to those who come to you from outside, whose manner is like this.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	Take care, however, lest your eagerness surpass your prudence and your ferocity.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	Do not presume anything beyond what is known by science, except that which experience confirms in you the success of your praiseworthy actions.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	Make use of the care of all your patients, the prognostication and the indication of that which is convenient for their health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in this lies for you the aid to the acquisition of fame and glory, and the memory and praise
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, his son, your intellect, and do not take away from you direction and inspiration: for this is in his hand.</start_of_turn>
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I, too, order this Chapter to be distinguished by chapters, according as it follows in the Chapter of Cautery, from the groin to the feet: that all your inquiries concerning what is best and what is needful may be alleviated from you.</start_of_turn>
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	Of the care of water which accumulates in the heads of children.</start_of_turn>
Caput I.	Chapter I.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this illness often happens to children at birth: or when the midwife tightens the head of the child without gentleness.</start_of_turn
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And sometimes it happens also from an occult cause which is not known.</start_of_turn
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I have not seen this illness in anyone except children: and concerning all those whom I have seen suffer from it, I have deemed it appropriate to send them away from surgery for this.</start_of_turn
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And indeed I saw from among the young ones whose heads were filled with water, and their heads grew great every day, until they could no longer sit upon themselves because of the size of their heads: and their moisture increased until they died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	Or else such moisture accumulates between the skin and bone: or accumulates under the bone upon the flesh.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in such a case, if there is moisture between the skin and bone, and the swelling is small, then it is necessary to make a single fissure in the middle of the head, equal in length to two knots, until the moisture is cured
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	This is the form of the sponge.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the moisture is greatly increased, and the swelling is great, then make two incisions, according to this form
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	If the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that the edges of the head are open from every side: and the water is squeezed out when you press your hand inwards, and it is not hidden by that: then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head, according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision extract all the moisture
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the incisions with strips and threads.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then keep that clean with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the ligament, and care for the wound with tension and care.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not bind the head with equality
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick man with little food of little moisture until the limb is healed, and recovered
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is that you consider where the swelling appears and the collection of water is great
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Wherever the head is more, either in the back or front, or on the right or left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Go up therefore with the incision where you see the swelling and the discharge of water: and cut that according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	Observe, that you do not cut an artery, and that there is an increase in the flow of blood, and that the patient dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Concerning the incision of the arteries which are behind the ears
Caput II.	Chapter 2
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When something falls into the eyes or chest, and it becomes old, and no remedy is of use: then the last remedy is the incision of those two arteries
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	It is necessary therefore when you wish to cut them, that you give the patient a sign that he should move his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then scrape the place with rough cloth, so that the arteries appear
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then bind the patient's neck with anything you have.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the pulse is beating
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places where both are located are those which are behind the ears depressed: and they are rarely hidden, except in some people
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then sign with a scar above each: and cut each with a spatula as sharp as possible, cutting through to the bone: and do that through the width of the head
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, introduce the spatula under the artery, and cut upwards with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be like two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the artery is cut, blood flows out with the pulsation, which jumps inside with frequent jumps
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If the artery does not appear to the sense, then it is necessary that measures be taken from the thumb to quantify the amount of space of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then signs with the thumb inwards, and find until the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which must be emitted from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps more or less is emitted from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of this is according to the quantity which appears to you from the patient and the refilling of the artery of him.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider concerning the pulse.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if anything remains to the bone from the soft part, then cut that, so that there be no cold swelling: then bind the pulse with strips of linen cloth
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with unguents, until it is healed
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Concerning the extraction of arteries, which are in time.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a man an ancient headache, or an acute catarrh due to acrid humilities and heat in the lacerations of the times, or an old soda, or bile, or similar things: and it is not to be remedied by the methods of the medical art, then we are experts in these diseases of the arteries of the times, or their cauterization, as we have said
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the manner of the operation in the extraction of these is that the sick man grasps the hair which are in the times, and brings them to the apparent artery in the time.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	And itself is often seen by you from your pulse, and rarely hides itself except in a few men, or the coldness of the air.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	And if it hides itself from you, then the sick man binds his head with anything he has: then he will rub the place with rough cloth
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Until the vapor has reached the place of the warm water, it will manifest itself visibly.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then grasp the sponge, which is already wet before its shape becomes visible.</start_of_turn>
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then cleanse the skin with it, and with the help of this [sponge] reach the artery.</start_of_turn>
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw in the cautery, and draw out the cautery upwards, until you have withdrawn it from the skin, and made it recede from the tunics beneath it on all sides.</start_of_turn
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If the artery is small: then grasp the cautery with the extremity of the hook.</start_of_turn
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from that side as much as the length of its extremities, and tighten, so that the blood flow is not increased.</start_of_turn
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if neither of these things is done, the blood will not ascend entirely.</start_of_turn
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then drain from the blood about six ounces, until three remain.</start_of_turn
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it is necessary to bind the cautery in two places with a strong thread of silk: or with an silken cord, so that it does not burst before the wound has consolidated, and that the blood flow is increased.</start_of_turn
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the excess, which is between the two ligatures.</start_of_turn
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this in an hour, or after an hour.</start_of_turn>
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if necessary, cauterize the cautery right up to the bone, with the cautery of a knife: until its extremities are cut through, and it remains in the same place as before the work.</start_of_turn
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	It is better work if the patient has a fever, or their complexion is flushed.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For indeed, the cautery is of the things which hasten the completion of humours.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore is better to cauterize.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of arteries, that the cautery be applied to the ancient place: and that a little ball of wool be placed over the top of the cautery.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the application of the cautery, care must be taken with dry physicians, which make meat appear to be born, and with cloths, until the wound is healed.</start_of_turn>
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If during the work blood flows from the artery, then it is proper to stop the bleeding with the cautery, or to place something over the place with pressure: and clench your hand until the bleeding stops.</start_of_turn
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If nothing of these things is present to you, then put over the place your finger, until the bleeding stops.</start_of_turn
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And bind up the place with cold water, until the pain subsides, and bandage according as is necessary.</start_of_turn
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And from this it is easier and more convenient to extract the artery, namely that you cauterize the vein with this cautery which has two blades: and that the sharpness of the two blades be like that of an almond.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	But indeed are they of much less sharpness than two blades.</start_of_turn
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are acute, like two blades, they are liable to cause both heat and burn the flesh: and they do not pass through the flesh with speed.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	For in these things there is somewhat of the size of the work, for the hold of the fire is kept in the work, and the flesh is quickly cut through: with this therefore the work is better in every work, and more gentle, and easier.</start_of_turn
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let there be space between the two knives equal to the length of a finger, after you have marked two points with the cautery: and remove both of them ignited upwards, until they reach the bone, and penetrate each other in two places: so that the distance between their extremities is elongated.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For indeed they do not solidify with this inward cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Take care that the acute tears do not flow from the eyes excessively
Caput IIII.	Chapter III
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When the tears are thick and flow excessively from the eyes, which are above the external part of the head, and do not cease from the eyes, and cause the face of the patient to be red, and he feels a walking sensation in front of him, like the walking of ants: and his eyes are wide, wet, because they are corroded by the tears: and the palpebrae are inflamed from the intensity of the tears: then the ancients disapproved of their treatment of these and named this treatment "Ense.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is necessary to shave the hair in front of the patient's face
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three incisions on the forehead, equidistant from each other according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the incision be like two fingers, and let one incision be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length of the lobes of the ears, and the third from the other side: and cauterize from the arteries which are in the two sides. And extend your hand from the continuation of the two mandibles, and let there be space between the incisions equal to the width of three joined fingers. And let there be prepared a sponge or dry cloth with which to soak up the blood
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce the sponge-bag of two acute extremities, whose form follows.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision from the temporal part up to the second incision: and scrape away the whole skin between the two incisions, with the sponge-bag containing the fat, which is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do the same from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then remove the sponge-bag and introduce another instrument, which is called the acute knife, through the first incision from one blunt side, not from the acute side
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And fix its sharp edge towards the fleshy substance with the attached skin, and its blunt side towards the bone: and press it in until it reaches the middle incision; and cut through everything that descends from the head to the eyes: except that which appears on the skin
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do the same in the middle incision up to the other incision
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And when the bleeding has ceased, express from the clots the quantity of blood which has collected.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then put on all the incisions a bandage of coarse cotton, and put over them soaked sponges in wine, and wax or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And take care that no swelling should arise.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day loosen the ligament and give a large infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the wound from the basic ointment, and leave the rest of the wounds to heal: until they are healed
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Regarding the care of acute tears and catarrh of the eyes from the inside of the head.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When acute carbuncles or abscesses occur on someone, and the eyes are swollen, small, and the face is pale: and the eyelashes are ulcerated, and hair falls out from the body, and there is sharp pain in the depth of the head, causing pain and sneezing: then take from these signs that the matter and carbuncles do not come from one source, except from many wounds.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the best treatment in this case is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	It is to scrape off the front of the head of the patient.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead, or on the other side along the breadth, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple: and extend the incision until you reach the bone: and pull your hand away from the edges of the wound, which move with chewing: until the bone is exposed: and you will drain all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with pieces of cotton wool, or with strips of linen.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then tie up above with threads: and soak the threads with wine and oil, so that no swelling will occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you have finished this, and the swelling of the carbuncle has begun to subside: then it is necessary to massage the bone, until new flesh begins to form in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	And then care for the patient with regular application of poultices which makes new flesh grow: such as if you take from wheat flour two parts, and from colophony four parts: and make from these an ointment, and apply it to the wounds
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	And concerning the care of the wound in the Golden Age.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Every substance in gold descends, is of four kinds: either a mineral lapis, or like stone, such as iron; or is from a plant, such as cicer and beans; or is a flowing substance, such as water and vinegar, and like these. Or it is an animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When any substance descends into gold, either a lapis that does not coexist in the gold or that does not grow in it, it exposes the gold to the air: if the lapis is removed, something is distilled out of the gold that was previously dissolved or mixed with it
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then perform the extraction, and make it adhere firmly with conditions, and seal up the nostrils near the insertion of the plug, after you have placed around the circumference of the ear a barrier of cotton wool, or wool, and extended the gold upwards
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	Many things depart with such care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If they do not depart, then perform the extraction with vinegar, that is, subtile pins. Which are of this shape
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If they depart with vinegar, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if they do not depart, then perform the extraction with a blunt needle of small size.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If they do not depart by that, then make a hole in the air, and insert the end of the tube into the ear many times, and seal up what is around the tube with wax mixed with oil, so that there is no air except the tube: then draw out with your hand with great force.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Many things depart with that which we have said
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If they do not depart in this way: take from barley or from vinegar, that is, prepared gluten, with which birds are caught, and put it in the extremity of the radius after you have enveloped over it the middle part well positioned: then insert it into the ear with ease, after you have dried the gold from moisture
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If, therefore, it does not depart with all that we have said, then it is proper to split [the wound] before the callous swelling or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	The method of splitting is as follows: like a phlebotomist I first prick the head of the patient, and from the blood I extract according to the measure of his virtue.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then I make the patient sit between my hands, and I support his head above, and I find the proper split at the root of the ear at the hollow place of the ear: and let the split be in the shape of a crescent, until you reach the stone: then remove it with the instrument.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then withdraw the split with your hand at the time, and take care of the wound, until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If anything falling from the ear is from a seed that grows and swells: then I direct the extraction of it
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it does not obey your order to come out, then grasp a small sponge, fine and subtle, according to this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And manage with it the excision of that kind from the seeds that fall into the ear, and do not make it bleed when you think that it is already softened by the vapor of the ear, until you place the sponge firmly: then remove it with hooks or with fine graspers, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction alleviates it
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	When water enters the ear, the patient must sneeze at the beginning: and I put the ear to the bottom of some cotton wool: and it is lying over the ear in which the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If it comes out through this, that is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then grasp many stones, according to the length of a finger, tight, fine, and warm them with fire next to it, and let the patient put one of his ears into the ear: and I will sprinkle one foot of his with salt from this side, and I will strike with the other stone on the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Until all the water has drained out, do not cease to do that with stone and stone.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	When the water has drained out, take some charcoal or alum and insert one extremity into the fire: and bring the other extremity close to the fire until most of it is consumed by the flame.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat the process with another piece of alum, and do this many times until all the water has drained out: and extract it with a needle as prescribed in the stone
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal that is within the stone, such as a flea or anything like it, care for it as I have said in the explanation.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body that appears to the sense: then manage its extraction with the hands and needles: and it will be easier for all who hold it in the fire.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	When the worms are generated in the fire, when you have cared for them as we have said in the explanation of distillation, and in the treatise on distillations, and your care has not availed: then it is necessary to uncover the fire.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If anything appears there from the worms: then extract it with the hands or with fine needles.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If nothing appears there: take a needle whose shape is like this, narrow below and wide above: and insert the lower extremity into the fire according to the capacity of the sick person: then draw it out with that strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times until all the worms have drained out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If they do not obey you to come out, then encircle the needle with lead, as I have said in the stone
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not depart with it as we have said: then perform distillations which the ancients are experts in in the handling of worms: and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your effusion be such as when you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument whose form is depicted here
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	Like water, make it from silver or lead, lower it tightly, in which there is a small hole, wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let the driving force which is in the curve of the tube be made of air centred
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a sphere, and put it at the end of the tube with a cover of cotton: then pour oil, or gum, or whatever you wish of these medicines into the tube: and let it be in the ear: then introduce the sphere with the cotton above, and press it with your hand cautiously, until the oil is driven into the curve of the ear, and the patient feels it inside: and whatever is poured into the ear will be warmed with fire immediately: and beware that nothing which is distilled is in the ear when it is cold: for medicines do not tolerate this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	Of the care of the accident of the ear.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.</start_of_turn>
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Whenever some children come out of the mothers' wombs unpierced.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And sometimes it happens to some people that their ear is operated on in meat by a wound, or is born with a cleft in it
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this operation is sometimes done in the deep cavity of the ear, which does not follow custom: and sometimes it happens outside the cavity of the ear a little, and follows custom.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Whatever happens in the depth of the ear, which the sight does not grasp, is difficult to heal in many arrangements.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	It is necessary that you put the ear of the patient in the sun and gaze into it: then, if you see the apparent removal of hair, open the ear with a fine spatula, whose form is this which follows, so that its extremity is in that part which has a small breadth, and that some part of it is acute: and the rest of the spatula should be soft on both sides, so that it does not harm the ear
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If, therefore, the hair is of the nature of that which grows in the flesh of the ear: then hold the ear with a fine hook, and cut through it with ease until the whole flesh is removed.</start_of_turn>
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the hair is in the depth of the ear: then grasp a thin, soft stick, and warm it with fire: then insert it into the ear.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If you sense hair with this, which the patient has with great suffering of hearing, try to open it with ease: and be careful, lest you injure the nerves of the ear.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put in the ear a plaster according to the quantity of the breadth of the hole which you have made in the unguent of Egypt: do this for a few days, until you are secure of the consolidation of the wound.</start_of_turn>
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take plaster, and mix it with rose water, and sprinkle upon it powdered gypsum, and use it.</start_of_turn
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see the ear already blackened: then you must extract the plaster, and allow it to be covered with another plaster, which you mix with powdered gypsum, which is made with rose water, until the swelling has subsided: then care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If blood flow increases: then immerse a sponge, or pack the area with cold water, and place above it a bandage: and employ the remaining treatment which separates the blood flow as described in the treatise on distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	On the care of the eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These Altheli which happen in the eyelids are either wet or dry
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	It is necessary therefore to keep the edges moist with tears or with an ointment: or with a single [ointment] and remove them with a sponge from their roots
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place over the place a soft cheese
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from the eye, then cauterize the blood vessel with a fine lancet.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And the cauterization is better after the incision
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	Many of them return when something remains from their roots
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when cauterized with fire, those roots are burnt and do not return
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	On the care of the great eyelid of the eye
Caput IX.	Chapter IX
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Many things happen in the eyelids something which assimilates the Crandinum in its hardness and its toughness, and because of this it is called the Great one: and it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation therefore is as follows: if there is a Great one proceeding from the eye, which appears from the eyelid and moves to every part, and its resolution is easy
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Find therefore above the edge a fissure for the width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then cleanse the wound from all sides with ease, until it is satisfied.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend the wound with one thread, and cut it off.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If indeed it is not prepared for cutting, except after you have pierced the lid with a small incision, then it will harm the patient in some way.</start_of_turn>
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the wound is large: then gather it together with sutures: and care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, it will not cause you any harm.</start_of_turn
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	The ointment will restore it and make the wound flexible.</start_of_turn
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if it is great and extends downwards towards the inner parts of the ear towards the surface inwards: then pierce the lid and suspend the large blood vessel with one thread: except that you will not need an incision, and press the wound from all sides.</start_of_turn
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	And if the lid is elongated by the incision, it will not cause any harm.</start_of_turn
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye from the incision of the great vessel with salt water: and care for the place with it that is flexible, until the patient is healed.</start_of_turn
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the care of the eyelashes.</start_of_turn
Caput X.	Chapter X.</start_of_turn>
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	The eyelash is a gland that is generated in the upper eyelid: and mostly it happens to children: and it weighs down their eyes, and causes them to shed tears in the mornings, and they cannot see the sunlight because of this, because the tears run down their faces always, and over their eyes while they sleep, and their eyelashes are always wet under their eyebrows because of the swelling: and the prominence of the eyelash is seen in the eye, and when you touch the place with your fingers, you feel the eyelash between your fingers.</start_of_turn
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And thus is the manner of his operation, that he place the patient's head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then grasp a towel, and prepare it in such a way that you make from it a circle according to the quantity that contains Axirnath from all sides
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place him upon the [incision], and press with your fingers from all sides, so that Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle thereof moisture with a sponge, and do not make a wound wider than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary that you find the whole skin, until you reach Axirnath in many positions, because Axirnath comes out of the wound according to the shape of the white pith of barley.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Extract therefore the said towel which you have infiltrated between your fingers outwards: and you will move your hand to the right and left, until it is scattered: and take care, lest you add to the wound, that you do not reach the eye with the sponge, and stain it
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	But if indeed Axirnath does not appear at the beginning of the wound, you will add a little to the wound with ease, until Axirnath comes out.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract the said towel, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then soak the towel in vinegar and water, and place it over the place, and bind it with wool threads.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And from men there are some who anoint salt, and place it in the hollow of the wound, so that the remainder of the moisture may liquefy.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if there arises in the place of the after-boil a thick pus, then care for it with soothing poultices, until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Regarding the methods of treating the eye when the eyelids are softened, so that the eye does not bulge excessively.
Caput XI.	Regarding the methods of treating the eye when the eyelids are softened, so that the eye does not bulge excessively.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When additional hairs grow in the eyelids surrounding the eye, and when they are excessive: then they harm the eye, and cause the methods of treatment to fail, such as excessive tears, softening of the eyelids, and inflammation, until such time as the cause of the eye's destruction is eliminated.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And Ataxmir of the eye is cured according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with acute medicine, as is mentioned previously in the chapter on cautery
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or by incision and suture
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by cautery, as I shall say
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary to place the head of the patient on your knee
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then grasp the lower eyelid of the eye with your left hand
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it turns easily, that is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert the needle through the fold of the lower eyelid, where the hair is, and pass the needle with the thread close to the base of the hair, and draw the thread up to the upper eyelid with the eyelid, and join the needle to the surrounding tissue.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find inside the eyelid under the added hair a space corresponding to the greater and lesser tears
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then draw out the thread and put under the eyelid a small piece of cotton or gauze: then sign over the eye with cautery, so that it looks like the figure of a myrtle leaf
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	The wound must be properly closed, so that it forms a figure according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for it is altered in different people.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	The wound must be properly closed, so that it forms a figure according to the quantity of the eyelid and the elevation of the border: for it is altered in different people.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	When the suture has been found over two lines which you have marked, and you have commenced from the greater lacrimal gland up to the lesser, and there is one opening near the natural hair, as is the thickness of a radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then introduce the needle through one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then remove the whole.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then gather together with the suture two lips, with a needle and a thin thread: and stop the bleeding, and make fast that which is superabundant from the threads over two superciliums, with some useful substance, if you wish to do so: or if not, do not worry about it.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then remove the suture and the thread for three days, or four: afterwards care for it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, remove the wound without suture, and care for it, which will dry up and contract
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is elevated at the sealing of the wound and the gathering of its parts: but the future is better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This is the way which the old men of Atarax taught to cure it.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	There is great solicitude over the sick man, and it comes from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another way is in Atarax: and it is that the sign on the eyelid should be like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have said.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three separate hooks, or aggregated, according to the form which follows, and then cut away what is superfluous with small scissors, according to the same form, with equal incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If, however, it is not possible to hold the hook, and it does not equal: then grasp the point where the thread lies and introduce it into the middle of the figure: and introduce another thread near the greater lacrimal, and another near the smaller lacrimal: and gather together the threads between your fingers with equality
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then lift your hand for elevation equally: and lift the skin above that which is signed with the mark of the limb, as we have said.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound with suture: and care for it until it is healed.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If, however, swelling should arise at the incision or wound: stop that swelling with powder, and with similar things, from the sponges which are sitting.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when the eyelids are also swollen, as their hair is converted.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is necessary therefore that you use what we said concerning the incision: but the suture of both is artificial
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	Concerning the care of Ataxmir with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, that you cover the eyelid, and split the wound which is inside, according to what I have said.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two incisions, or two small sticks underneath: whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and the width of them is less than the width of the pupil: and I put in the stitches at the extremities from both parts where you have the thread
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather together both things with slightness over that which is superfluous from the eyeball, and string two threads from both parts tightly, and let go of them every few days
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	The skin, when tightly closed, will die, darken, and putrefy until it falls away by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If delayed, then cut it open with scissors.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When it has consolidated, elevate the eyelid: and do not pierce the hair.</start_of_turn
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two incisions which you make according to this figure and their quantity in length and breadth.</start_of_turn

Caput XII.	Chapter XII.</start_of_turn>
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in this case is to take a fine needle and introduce it under the silk thread, which is soft.</start_of_turn
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then join the ends together, and make knots at each end with a fine loop: and let the length of the thread be equal to one palm.</start_of_turn
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then make another fine loop of thread under this one in a short space, and knot the ends if you wish.</start_of_turn
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then put the patient's head on your lap, and let it be near the heel so that the operation is visible: because it is a slight operation, or even a minute.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the needle with the loop at the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you have pulled out the natural hair.</start_of_turn
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull out the hair until above the loop: and insert into the loop the tip of the hair: if there is one, or two, or three, not more.</start_of_turn
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand with that which is towards the elbow, until the hair escapes with its root adhering to the eyelashes with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	Then draw your hand with that which is towards the elbow, until the hair escapes with its root adhering to the eyelashes with the natural hair.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either associate it with a long hair from the natural hair and elevate it with that: or dismiss it and let it grow out again, and then elevate it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Concerning the care of the eyelash which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this happens to the eye, it is called a Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	This eyelash is either natural or accidental
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Accidental, therefore, is from the consolidation of a wound, or section, or cautery, and things like these
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of operation in this is that you find the consolidation and separate its lips, and put between them a bit of lint from linen, and bind it, until it is healed
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And do not use in the treatment anything which excites and contracts: for if you do, the eyelash will deteriorate more than before: rather use those things which soften, such as barley flour: and embroil with water, in which be dissolved aloes, poppy seeds: and oil of almond, which is liquefied with some oil: and mix with this lint, and care with this.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	Your store of remedies is, that you may be prepared with every ingenuity, that it may not be shaken, following the form which was in the first place.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	This operation, as we have said, is not without some rectification of the Alxatrati, that it may not return to its former shape altogether
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Regarding the care of the Alxatrati which is in the lower eyelid, and is a swelling or contraction above to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 123.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This swelling of the Alxatrati which is in the lower eyelid, is what is truly called the Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And it is accidental from a wound, or a tear, or a burn, and such like things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the way of operating in this is that you take a needle, in which there is a doubled thread, and you pass it under the meat, and make it penetrate from the left lacrimal gland up to the right lacrimal gland, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the meat.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then stretch the meat upwards with the needle, and cut the vein with a wide blade
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If, therefore, the figure of the eyelid returns to its former state as it should be, that is good
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, grasp the edge, and put it into the wound, and close it with it: and find two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two incisions go from two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle: until when they meet they form the figure of the two letters together, which is the Greek letter lambda
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	And then remove that piece of meat by as much as the width of its acute lower end, from that which follows the eyelid
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather the separated parts: such as with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them as we have said, with soothing medications, and ointments, until they are healed.</start_of_turn>
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if the Alexatrati occurs from a wound, and the suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you find the wound flat under the eyelashes, even as before.</start_of_turn
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between two lips with ointment, as we have said.</start_of_turn
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the sum of the sermon about the care of the Alexatrati, when it is above, or below, is that you should care for it in that operation, according to the form of the Alexatrati.</start_of_turn>
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For itself, there are many variations in form: and the prudent artist prepares the ingenuity in any way that is possible for it, until it returns to its natural form, or almost so, and the patient himself, according to what suits him from the operation and the instruments in many arrangements.</start_of_turn>
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	About the adhesion of the eyelashes to the conjunctiva, or the cornea.</start_of_turn
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.</start_of_turn
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	When this consolidation happens to many people, it is like the upper eyelid to stick to the white of the eye, and to prevent it from doing its natural operations.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore you must introduce the edge of the radius under the eyelid, and raise it upwards: or extend it with a needle: then cut the adhesion with a fine sponge, which is not with the sharpness of the knife, but rather blunt, so that it does not irritate the patient during the operation, and that it does not move the eye from its natural position: and that the incision be like that which you would make to scratch that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the adhesion is completely healed.</start_of_turn
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Pour water into the eye, while the water washes it out: or distill it into it from a vessel made of lead, from vinegar dissolved in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a strip of linen: and place above the eye wool infused with alum or gypsum: and after three days use the vessel, and with the solidarities, until the eye is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	Regarding the incision of the nail and the prominence of the carnis lachrymarum.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You know that the nail exists in two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	It is nervous: and is similar to hard sand, thin.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen white moisture: which when it touches iron, or you try to grasp it with a hook, it breaks, and does not remain in the nail
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	Both of these species do not begin, except for the greater lacrimal gland, until it has gone slowly, until it covers the whole area, and hinders the light, and the movement of the eye
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the way to operate on its incision is: as you place your thumb on your cheek.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open its eyes, and lift its eyelid with your hand
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then gather the nail with a hook of few doublings, and extend it upwards
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take the needle, and introduce it through the hair of the horse, and blood, or urine: and make the thread strong, and double the end of the needle slightly, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce the nail with the needle, and ligate the nail with the thread, and extend it upwards: and remove the hair surrounding the pupil, as if you were trimming the nail until its end
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then strike the remainder to the root of the lacrimal bone with a fine spatula, or with small forceps: and discharge the natural flesh of the lacrimal bone, so that it does not obstruct the course of the tears.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when the nail extends with a single claw: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it is to be scraped away with a gentle spatula, of which this is the form
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	Beware, lest you touch the tough membrane of the corneal tunicle, and cause a break therein, and perforate the pupil
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, pour upon the eye some salt dissolved in water, or take some from a sieve made of lead, and discharge it until tomorrow.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with what is necessary, until it is healed
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not sensitive and does not have soft tissue to impede its insertion, nor does it protrude in it, then it is to be treated with many medicines, and will be healed as I have said in the discourse
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you wish to make an incision, then open the eye of the patient, and take a fine spatula, gentle and delicate in its sharpness, of this form
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And remove the nail from above with care and precision
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it is becoming rarefied and crumbling, and that it has been crushed in the ratio, then pour out from your hour glass into the eye from a sieve made of lead, or from a sieve of red lead, or from salt: and bathe the eye until tomorrow
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation above until the whole of it is healed
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless the contrary be the case, if there be a callous swelling in the eye, let it be discharged and the eye be cared for until it is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	And then repeat the operation until the reason has ceased, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	But the prominence of the caruncle of the lacrimal gland, if it causes great pain in the eye, is to be severed with a single incision, and not to make the last incision, lest the tear duct be injured.</start_of_turn>
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	And then let there be a sticking in the tear duct of a red stuff, or made from alum, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	As for the incision of the Algardene, and the native tissue in the eye.</start_of_turn
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.</start_of_turn>
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	It sometimes happens in the eyes of men that a red mass of flesh is formed, either superposed or underlying, which covers the pupil, approaches or tightens over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outwards: and it consumes the pink of the pupil.</start_of_turn
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation for this is also to put the diseased head in your hand.</start_of_turn
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes and collect all the flesh with hooks which are suitable for this: and hold it with one hand.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	And then cut the flesh at first, until all of it is finished with a knife.</start_of_turn
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And burn away from the eye, so that you do not harm it during the operation: and let your incision be like that of the nail, which we have mentioned in the incision of the nail: or with small forceps, with which the hair is collected, as it will be after this head.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When the incision is complete and the entire garden of nerves is restored, then put the eye out from the salt that is crumbled: or distill it into the form of red powder, and similar things are done by physicians with corrosive medicines: and put over the eye a compress of alum with vinegar or urine: that it may be protected from the heat of the afterburn.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	When anything remains of the nerves and the blood is warm, and the afterburn is imminent: then withdraw the eye and care for it with that which will soothe the afterburn.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over it with the operation until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do the like with meat added which has happened in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	It is true that one must be wary of the natural disposition or any accidental misfortune, working with iron: and do not insert your hand into any such operation until you are certain that the limb can tolerate it.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Of the collection of the eye-fat.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	The fat surrounding the eye is of a red color and covers the eye: it hinders the operation of the water and weakens the eye with the length of the days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	It is necessary therefore that you should first consider whether the eye in which the fat is, is strong and has no other ailment besides the fat: then collect the fat from it
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is necessary to take great care that you do not put your head in danger.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one or two sutures according to your prudence: and let the suture be of fine thread, two together in one body, or two separate threads of equal size.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect with fine forceps those one or two which are under the skin, and remove the blood hour after hour, until the matter has receded: and take heed lest you damage the eye with the extremities of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	Let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be firm in your operation lest you cause harm to them
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have completed your work, then pour into the eye a cold or red sponge: that its sharpness may consume what remains of the clot.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If it is not possible for you to collect all of it in that hour, then close the eye with wax, which will quieten the pain of the eye: and leave it for a few days, until the pain has subsided: and keep it from the cold: and repeat the procedure above until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	This is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	(The provided text does not include the next sentence, so I cannot translate it.)
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Doctors call the swelling of the eye Arissa Fistula, which they cure with cautery or with acute medicine that burns, according to what is necessary in each case.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no wisdom in it: except that you find pus on the edge of its swelling, and extract all the moisture which is in it and pus, until the bone is exposed
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When the bone is thus exposed, and you see corruption or blackness, then close it with an instrument of this shape
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And this is called the closing of the head
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Make it of iron wire, and let its head be round like a nut, which is pierced with the point of a needle, or with the point of a needle and a fine awl: and put it on the place of the corrupted bone
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then withdraw it between your fingers, and touch your hand lightly, until you know that no damage has been done: and do it often.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the limb with the help of astringents and haemostatic agents.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If, however, consolidation has taken place in the part, and swelling has occurred therein, and the flow of blood has been interrupted: and it remains for forty days, and does not recover, and does not soften, and does not become red, then you know that it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then it is not in that limb, except by reducing the swelling to the size of a bean, according to this form.</start_of_turn
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is necessary to grasp the bone with a second hand, with a pointed instrument or with acute medicine: and when it is grasped, then take hold of the limb according to this form, whether the handle be of iron, triangular: and the wood of it be a protracted pyramid until the extremity, like water.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it over the bone itself: and let it be near the tear-duct: and pull your hand away from the eye a little.</start_of_turn
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then withdraw your hand with the limb, until it penetrates the bone, and you feel it to be weak: by this you will know that something has escaped from there, when you keep your hand on your nose.</start_of_turn
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore restore the limb with astringents and haemostatic agents, as I have taught you.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When swelling has occurred in the part, and the limb has become hardened: then the matter which had flowed outwards returns to the nose: thus it is more gentle over the wound.</start_of_turn
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	¶ On the reduction of the swelling of the Eye.</start_of_turn>
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye emits with its entirety, and does not subside in any liquid remedy, neither diminished: then it is necessary to lance the diseased part: then perform phlebotomy: afterwards place poultices upon the wound without incision, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then put upon the eye an ointment which is made from acacia, and aloe, and oil, and beeswax.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye above upon a pad with many feathers.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the manner of feathers is: that you take down feathers, many, and fold every feather from four sides: make from these many: then put one upon another, according to the quantity that the eye needs: then bind over them with a hard cloth of strong structure
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat the poultices with suction without incision.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the poultices, and keep the eye closed day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If however the ligament is again softened, then it is necessary to bind it much: then remove the ligament after a day and a night, as we have said
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see the eye again become swollen with swelling, it is good: and if not, then repeat the pad, and the feathers, and the binding, and the poultices, until it is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	¶ On the incision of the fifth part of the tunica.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When there occurs a rupture in the tunica of the pupil, then it emits and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grain of the pupil, and becomes swollen in the shape of a man because of this, and the eye is incisored for this: then the operation in this is as we have narrated: and it is that you introduce the needle into the root of the pupil from the lower part to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another needle there where the double thread is at the tear duct, and make it penetrate: and withdraw the first needle according to its own arrangement.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then pierce the place of the double thread and ligate with it a part of the vein around the needle: and tighten it much
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then withdraw the needle and place above the eye a wool plug in the abscess: and withdraw it, until the thread comes out with the vein.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with it, which soothes it, until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the vein is tied from every part with a circle of cloth, until the eye regains great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then pierce with a fine sponge, which reaches the depth of the eye, and let out the moisture of the abscess, and let the eye descend, and mix: then tighten it, until it is healed
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	(End of translation
Caput XXII.	(End of translation
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This ailment which is called Alcomnati, is not, in fact, except for health, which arises in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of treatment for this is to make the patient sit on a prepared seat, or directly
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take hold of his head with your hands from two parts, and move it, until you see health rise up to the lower part of his eye
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then keep it still, and do not let it descend, and open the light: and he will see the infirm as he saw before: and if it does not descend downwards, you know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If the descent of the bowels is not prepared as we have said, then sit the patient between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then grasp the sponge gently and find where it is above the fatty tissue around the junction of the joint with the cornea in the crown, until the bowels issue forth
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When they have issued, then pour into the eye lukewarm water in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have pounded barley and honey; then care for it with the rest of the treatment until the patient is healed
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	As for the care of the water which descends into the eye, or a cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have said concerning the kinds of water which are useful for irrigation, and which are declared and recommended, then grasp that which is suitable for the health of the patient.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then you must make the patient sit between your hands square, opposite the light, near the heel: and fix his eye well, and bind it tightly: then with your right hand grasp the eyelid of the eye which is opposite the eye which has the water in it, if the eye which has the water in it is the left eye: or with your left hand if the eye which has the water in it is the right eye.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then grasp your right hand with the sponge, if the eye is left: or your left hand if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the edge of the sponge near the crown over the length of the radius in the white of the eye apparent to the lesser lacrimal gland: then press the sponge with force: and you will draw back your hand until the sponge penetrates the membrane of the eye: and you will feel that the sponge has reached the bottom of the eye
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And you must measure the distance of the descent of the sponge to the depth, the measurement of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the black of the eye: and this is the circumference of the eye
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see it in the very pupil of the eye, because of the clarity of the corneal tunic.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then put the almond right up to the place where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press the lower part of the eye with one hand after the other
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore water descends immediately, then the diseased part swells up immediately over that which opened the pupil, and the almond in the eye
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest for a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If water descends again, then take out the almond once more, except that which has come out already.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When it has settled down, and does not ascend: then draw out the almond easily: and you will turn your hand slowly
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve in water something of the clear salt of a pearl: and wipe it away with that when the eye is closed
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put over the whole eye a bandage, or soaked lint with rose oil, and alum: and bind it with this to the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	And we, and those who are with us at this time, put on the eye a plaster of beaten alum with egg white.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If it does not admit the almond to enter the eye because of its hardness, because it is from a man whose eye is hard and dry: then you must take sponge-wool, which is called Alberid, of this shape
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Keep it closed with this as well, and do not touch the hand in the wound: and do not do anything else except to make the almond enter the shallow part of the eye
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then insert the almond as we have said
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And besides that, the patient is prepared in the middle of the room, having been placed upon his back in a dark chamber: and he is to be guarded from all movement, and from coughing: and food is to be given him of that which will soothe the natural qualities of his body. He must not move his right or left hand at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the ligament be kept in its accustomed position until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then loosen it in that dark chamber, and let him experience its effect: and make him drink something.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligament until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not fitting that he should do this at the hour of care, or immediately after the incision: indeed it is better that others should do this, because the water ascends quickly through the aspect which is inflamed
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If, however, a cold abscess occurs: then it is fitting that you open the eye before the seventh day: and close it when the abscess has subsided: then give him food by mouth, which will restore his appetite in those few days, even though he is in that dark chamber.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him gradually go out of the room, and return to his home.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in this state the pupil is not excused from the vision of others: then indeed he will hear about the operation
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed it has come to our attention from some of the people of Alayrach that there is a perforation in the magdano of Alayrach through which water flows out
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But indeed we do not see anyone in our land who has done this, or have read of it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that this is something new
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the shapes of the species from great things, that they remain above those who ignore them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Be like air itself: and their extremities are like those of a triangle with the base equal to the height, and the apex acute
Formae magda.	Great things.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the care of the newly born flesh in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	When meat of various kinds is born in the nose, there is something which is assimilated from scorpions of many feet: from this is cancer, stone, brown flesh: from this is what is soft flesh, not brown flesh
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In these things which are soft from the said meats, not fraudulent, neither cancerous, it is necessary that you make the diseased part rest between your hands opposed to the solid object, and open the pores of the nose, and throw out the mucus from them: then draw them out to the exterior, and cut away what you have seen from them with a fine sharp knife from one side until you know that the whole flesh has been removed
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	And if anything remains from that from whose excision is not possible: then remove that with a fine instrument with ease, until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If blood is dominant, or there is a thick pus: then oppose to it that which is appropriate: or that there are malignant abscesses, then burn them properly until the blood is shed, and remove all the flesh
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then spit in the nose after the incision of the bone, and water, or liquid.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If the nose is opened, and moisture proceeds from it up to the palate, then you know that it is healed
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If, however, the moisture has not penetrated, according to what is required, then you know that it is within the flesh that has been born in the upper bones of the nose, which does not come out with the incision of the instrument.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Therefore it is necessary to introduce a thread of linen which has some thickness to it, and to make knots in it: and to put between each knot the quantity of digit, or less: and the infirm person will draw out one extremity of the thread through the nose with a handle, or in any way he can manage, until it has reached the depth, and has gone beyond the soft parts
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many people do the same thing as this boy Attom in schools: and it is an easy thing for him who wishes it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place two extremities of the thread, one which comes out through the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	And then bind up the wound of the flesh with the knots which are in the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is together with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then draw out the thread: and put in the nose after washing the blood out with a bandage of Egyptian unguent: do this three days, or more, until the unguent has eaten away all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put in the end of the matter in the nose a lead weight, for a few days, until it is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	But if further care is needed, use this also
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For making the head-sweat, with which are distilled oils and other medicines into the nose, do this from silver, or from an air-vessel: which is like a small lamp, open like a snail, and its substance is like that of balm
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	If one wishes to make a closed cannula, like a tube.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	If one wishes to make a closed tube for the head of a wound, let it be full, with a handle at its back, so that you may grasp it, when you heat it in oil, or whatever you wish from succus, and fluid substances.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	This is the shape of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	Of the care of the nose
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Many times the Thelul of the nose is born at the extremity of the nose, and it grows large and increases with the days, until it becomes the aspect of the face.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And for this reason it is necessary, that in the beginning of its appearance you should cut away all of it
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then put upon it a plaster, or cautery, or burning medicine which is in its place
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If therefore its incision is delayed until it has grown large, then consider, if it is stony, hard, of the color of soot, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron: for it is cancerous.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	Many times indeed wax flows from the apostema which has happened from it a great malice over the substance which had it
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the apostema is soft to the touch, not of the color of soot, and wax flows from it because of the possibility of incisions throughout its entirety, then evacuate the infirm person and cut it without fear, without hesitation: and care for the place with oil which exudes and contracts, until it is healed
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Of the stitching of the nose, and the lip, and the ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You know that when solution of continuity is accomplished in a cartilaginous substance, it does not suffice in that operation, except in certain individuals.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore when anything has happened to something else from that [cause], as for example when a wound is accompanied by blood: then join together the two edges of the wound with suture: then care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the solution of continuity has been accomplished and the lips are already separated, and each part is sound: then it is necessary to strip off all the surrounding parts from the surface, until the bleeding has ceased.</start_of_turn>
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then join together the two lips with suture, and tighten them, and spread over it dragon's blood and pounded olive oil: and place over the powder a piece of sponge and any other firm substance: and leave it bound for two days, or three.</start_of_turn>
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then loosen it and give the medicine: and leave it until the stitches dissolve by themselves.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The manner of suturing is that you join together the solution of continuity, or with an awl, as we have said in the suture of the belly: or join together the solution with thread, as you have been told.</start_of_turn
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	Regarding the extraction of the nodes of the lips.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.</start_of_turn>
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people in their inner lips have swellings like hard grains of grass: and some of them are small, and some are large.</start_of_turn
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary to cover the lips, and find over every node of it, and suspend it with a needle, and cut away from all sides.</start_of_turn
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then apply the compress to the place where the incision has been made, until the blood has clotted.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then apply the compress with the vinegar, and care for the place with it, where there is a haemostasis, until the wound is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	After the excision of the flesh from above the jawbone.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXVIII.	The head is held back.</start_of_turn
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Many veins are born from the jawbone, which the ancients call abuluss.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	It is necessary therefore to suspend the veins with a hook: or to tie them with forceps, and to cut them at their root, and to let the blood run out, or the blood clot.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then put over the place where the incision has been made, or some other powdered astringents, dried.</start_of_turn
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	And if the flesh returns to its place after the treatment, because many veins have returned, then cut the vein again at a second place, and cauterize it: for it does not return after being cauterized.</start_of_turn
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	About the reason for the tooth with the iron.</start_of_turn
Caput XXIX.	The head is held back.</start_of_turn
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When they gather together on the surfaces of the tooth from the inner and outer parts, and between the gums, rough, hard, and sometimes when they decay, and the gums become soft and yellow, until corruption reaches the jaw, and teeth are formed from it.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	It is necessary therefore to make the patient sit between your hands, and hold his head in your lap, and grasp the tooth and the gum, where you see the cortices, like sand: until something remains from it, and do the same with the blackening, and the yellowing, and the yellowing of the gums.</start_of_turn
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If anything is to be removed from the beginning which is the cause of the disease, it is good; and if not, repeat over the cause every other day, the second day, and the third day, until the study reaches the end of the matter concerning which you inquire.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	You know that there are diverse kinds of surgical instruments of various forms: according to the way you prepare the operation which you are about to perform: for, the instrument which bites from below is different from the one which bites between the teeth, according to other forms.</start_of_turn>
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of instruments are prepared for you, which you require.</start_of_turn>
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	Of tooth extraction.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.</start_of_turn>
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary to cure the tooth from its pain with all possible ingenuity, and then to eradicate it.</start_of_turn
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	It is not in any way possible to replace it when it is eradicated: because it is a sublime substance: until such time as there is no excuse for eradicating it, then it is necessary to compel the patient to eradicate it, so that it will strengthen, and confirm to you that the tooth is painful.</start_of_turn
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Many people indeed suffer from the patient's pain, and think that it is in the tooth itself and eradicate it: but the pain does not depart, until the diseased tooth is eradicated.</start_of_turn
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For indeed we saw it happen in the case of phlebotomy.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When it is confirmed to you that the tooth itself is painful, then you must sacrifice around the tooth with sponge sticks, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is separated from all sides: then move the tooth itself with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first slowly, until you have loosened it.</start_of_turn
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place the large forceps at a good location in that area, and the head of the patient between your knees: as you have kept it well, so it will not move. Then draw out the tooth following the rule of correctness, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If it does not come out, then grasp some of those instruments and introduce it under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it, as you did at first
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If, however, the tooth is perforated or corroded: then it is necessary to fill the hole with a piece of cloth: and tie it with a thread of fine radius, so that it does not break during your constriction with the forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	It is also necessary to cauterize around the gums from all sides much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And keep your courage, so as not to break it, and remain firm with some of it remaining, and bring back the patient from this pain which is greater than its first pain
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	Beware, do not do what the phlebotomists do in their frenzy, and over-confidence in your ability to eradicate it, beyond what we have said.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Many indeed make them worse for great illnesses of the body which are more difficult to break, and remain with all their roots, or some of them: or that they extract it with some of the teeth of the jaw: as we have often seen
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it should be bound up after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If there is a flow of blood from the place (for many indeed such things happen), then there is something from the sponge, and introduce it into that place: and if not, cauterize it if it does not bring you the sponge.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forceps are of fine make, their long handles, short thumbs, broad blades, so that they do not double when laid upon the tooth: like the arms of wrestlers, until, when they are bound with the tooth, they do not hurt themselves, neither do they double: short handles. They are of iron or forged from the center, their handles directed straight; and in their extremities are teeth, some of which enter into some, and bind the constriction loosely, strongly.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes their extremities become like the beak of a bird called a ciconia, and they are strong constrictions
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Of the extirpation of teeth, and the extraction of fractured mandibular bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter One
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When there remains in the extirpation of a tooth which has fractured something, then it is necessary to place butter on the socket for one or two days, until the place is softened: then introduce into the cavity either an algi or forceps, whose extremities resemble the beak of a bird called a ciconia
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The form of these forceps is as follows.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Their extremities are made like a file or an awl
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, they do not obey you at the extraction with these forceps, then you must place the gauze over the root, and remove all the flesh, and introduce the small hook, which is of this shape
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let the handles be short, the blades broad: and do not be wet, lest they break
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If the root comes out through that, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to bite with these instruments again which have this shape
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first triangle of the extremity, in which there is some bulk.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The shape of the triangular extremity is slight
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It is also made with this instrument having two branches, of which this is the shape.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and materials which proceed in the ratio of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	It is also made with this instrument which is similar to a large bowl, of this shape, the triangular extremity twisted, in which there is some bulk, so that it does not break: and let it not be soaked
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	You know that there are many instruments for teeth: and similarly the rest of the instruments do not fit together, and the skilled craftsman, skilled in his art, discovers by himself the appropriate instrument for each operation and its difficulties.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because of the various types of materials which they are made of, as the ancients did not speak of these instruments.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If however the bone breaks from the mandible, or from any other bones of the mouth, or becomes putrid: then to look upon it in its place with the instrument and forceps which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and to grasp it with the hand, whose shape is this
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	There is some bulk in it gradually, so that it is bound, or is held with the bone, and does not flee and slip away, until the bone is driven out: and restore the place with the physicians who are suitable for this
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then remove it from its putrefaction and care for it, until it is healed
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Of the closure of the teeth which are prominent over others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter two.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth deviate from their natural course, a wound is formed in that way: and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely in those who are unwed.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary therefore to consider this matter carefully
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth has been born after another tooth, and has not found its place, or if it is possible to close it, or to file it down: then it must be extracted. And if it is attached to another tooth, then it must be fractured with this instrument which has this shape.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is like a small face, made of iron, with acute extremities at the edges
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision be such that you can cut through it on many days, because of the hardness of the tooth, and that it does not damage any other teeth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	But if it is exposed from the liming of your teeth: then file it down with a file made of iron, which has this shape.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let it be all of iron, and its handle have minor points of various sizes, like a file which is used for filing teeth little by little over many days with ease, so that it does not damage the tooth, and that it falls out: then smooth it, and finally finish it off with some rasps
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	For if a tooth has broken off, and has wounded the tongue: then it is necessary to file it down until the roughness of that fracture has disappeared, and it is evened out: and it is flattened, and does not wound the tongue, nor corrupt the speech
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Of the reposition of teeth with gold wires.
Caput XXXIII.	End of book.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When teeth in front are struck by concussion and commotion from a blow, or in a case: and it is not possible to support them so that they do not fall out: and it is necessary to place them with physicians' styptics, and it is not useful to treat them: then it is better to leave the wisdom in its place and to string them with a gold wire: for gold does not become soft, and does not rot after days: but silver always changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the middle thread be in tension and bulk according to the quantity that it takes between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	The form of the suture is such that you take the thread and pass its double through between two sound teeth: then you pass the two extremities of the thread between the teeth that are affected, whether one or more, until you have passed them right up to the sound tooth of the opposite side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then you repeat the process until you reach the part from which you began: and keep your hand steady with attention, until it does not move forward: and let your tension be such that it does not slip from the roots of the teeth.</start_of_turn>
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the excess threads with scissors: and gather each together, and unite them with a knot: and hide them between the sound tooth and the affected tooth, so that it does not irritate the tongue: and let it go so tight as to remain firm.</start_of_turn>
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If, however, it comes loose or breaks, string it with another thread, and hold it like that for the whole time.</start_of_turn>
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of the teeth, and the figure of the suture of two sound teeth, and two affected teeth, as if you were drawing them.</start_of_turn>
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And when it is finished, as when one tooth, or two after an abscess, has returned to its place, and has been sutured as we have said, and remains: and this does not happen except by a skillful and experienced artificer.</start_of_turn>
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And when some bone or piece of cartilage has been adjusted: and it is made like a tooth, and is placed in the place from which the tooth was removed and is sutured, as we have said: and it remains, and serves its purpose for a long time.</start_of_turn
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	On the incision of the ligament which happens under the tongue, and which hinders speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	On the incision of the ligament which happens under the tongue, and which hinders speech.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	When the ligament under the tongue is either naturally present from birth or has been injured, it hinders speech.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation in this case is to open the patient's head in your hand, and lift up his tongue: then cut through that nerve of the ligament to the extent that the tongue is freed from its retention
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	Which if there is anything hard and nodular, and which comes from the consolidation of the wound: then remove that piece of cartilage, and find the nerve of the ligament through its breadth, until you have cut through the ligament, and the knot is freed
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware that there be no perforation in the depth of the flesh, and that you cut through an artery there, and cause the flow of blood to cease.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then close up the wound with salt, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then put under the tongue a bandage of linen which will hold the patient in every night: so that it does not consolidate again
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If however the flow of blood should happen, then put upon the place some soft wool
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If blood should stain you, then burn the place with a burning lentile which is suitable for this: then care for yourself with the rest of the treatment, until you are healed
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	Of the extraction of the ranula which is under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Of the extraction of the ranula which is under the tongue
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	When there happens under the tongue a small abscess which assimilates the small ranula, hindering the tongue from its natural operation: and perhaps it becomes so great that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation in this is, to open the bone of the sick person before the sole: and consider the aftereffect.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If, therefore, you see the wound itself of a dusky or black colour, hard, from which the sick person has no sensation: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it inclines towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then project into it a fine needle, and strike it with a small hammer, and free it from every part.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	And if blood incites you in the hour of your operation, then put upon it a soaked sponge, until the blood is absorbed: then return to your operation, until you have extracted it with its complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	And then it shall be bound with vinegar and salt: and care for the rest according to the suitable cure, until it is healed
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	As for the care of the aftereffect of two Amigdalar, see the section on that matter.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter Six.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When they happen between the guttur godad, that is, the glands which resemble almonds, which happen outside: and which are called two Amigdalae: when you cure them as we have said in the discourse, and they do not heal, then consider them
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If there is a hard aftereffect, of a dusky colour, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	If it is of a reddish colour, and its root is large: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, rather remove it, until it is ripened
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either pierce it through: or rupture it by itself
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	If it is of a white colour, round, and its root is thin: then it must be cut through
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation in this case is such that you must consider before performing it, if the after-effect of your procedure has become quiet and complete, or if there is imminent diminution: then do this: place the patient face down on the bench, and let his head be in your lap: open his mouth and take hold of the instruments between your hands, and pull down his tongue with the instrument.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Do this with silver, or with an instrument which is as thin as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you have done this, and you have pulled down the tongue, and the after-effect appears, and the wound has closed: then grasp the instrument and fix it in the flesh, and draw out what is inside as much as possible, without tearing anything from the clothes.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	And then cut the wound with the instrument which has this form.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	Thus are the forceps: truly their extremities are bent, so that the opening of each is at a right angle to the other: take care that it should be of iron or wetted with alum.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not present, then cut with a scalpel whose form is this
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Acute at one end, not acute at the other end.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut through the flesh once, cut the other according to this same kind of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If blood flows, gargle with water in which are boiled almond shells: or leaves of myrtle, and things like those from sponges: until the bleeding stops: then care for him until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when there appear in the throat other after-effects besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Proceed thus, as I have said concerning the incision of two equal amygdalar.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	I have also treated a woman with a swelling in her throat, which was born between her ribs and caused her to choke, with little consciousness. She breathed with difficulty from her narrowed throat and I forbade her from eating and drinking. She died within one or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	The swelling only ascended as far as to emit two branches, until it went beyond the two nostrils
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I therefore acted promptly and bound it with one bandage
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled out a great piece from it
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut through the skin at the root of the nose
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I removed the diseased tissue from the other nostril
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened his mouth and pressed out his tongue. Then I bound the bandage to the swelling. I then cut away a part of it, but there was little blood. The woman immediately began to drink water and ate food immediately
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	I did not stop cutting from that swelling for a long time. The swelling returned to its place where I had cut it, until it became prolonged and remained there.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I devised a plan and cauterized the swelling between the ribs.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It stood still from that moment on: then I went away and do not know what God did with her after me
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the incision of a small swelling.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 7.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrh descends to the lower parts and causes swelling, and is long, it is called a perpendicular swelling. And if it is in the lower part large and round, it is called a double swelling
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When the ailment is treated with that which we mentioned in the discussion, and the treatment does not suffice: and you see that the after-effects of the caldum have subsided from it, and it is slight: then it is necessary to cut it out.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what has become rounded from it, and has no length, and is blood-red, or of a tawny or black colour, and has no sensation: then it is necessary to make an incision in it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For in these cases there is fear of the diseased part
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	It is necessary therefore, when you see that the after-effects of the white substance have subsided, and its length, that you make it sit upon the diseased part alone: and you grasp its tongue with an instrument which I have mentioned previously: then you will fix the ligature in one place, and draw the diseased part downwards: and you will cut through the diseased part with one of the two instruments which I have mentioned in the cutting of two carpo-metacarpal joints
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And you must not cut through it except that which is beyond the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut through it more, you will cause damage and speechlessness.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the cutting, use what we have mentioned in the cutting of two carpo-metacarpal joints: and care for it until it is healed
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If however the diseased part returns from the cutting: then it is necessary to use your skill in cauterization without fear and timidity.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cauterization in these cases is not except with acute water: and it is that you place the head of the diseased part in your hand.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	And grasp its tongue with the instrument which we have mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it with burnt charcoal, and put the diseased part not thick nor thin, and touch it with the concave side of this instrument.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	The extremities of it are placed in which medicine is contained, like the radius of a cone.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	The instrument is placed with the medicine above it: and the patient lies with his side facing upwards, so that the discharge from his mouth may flow inwards of the medicine, without descending to his throat, and irritate him
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then take hold of your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you from the first part above the quantity of half an hour, until you perceive it to be softened, and the biting of the medicine to cease
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to grasp the limb, and cover it with the medicine, and give the limb a support with the medicine, and insert the radius into the cannula above, until the limb adheres to the upper part
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times, until you have finished with the cautery of the vein.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then remove the instrument: for it itself will dry up and fall off in three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you do not understand how to proceed, repeat the medicine: and after cauterization, remove the surrounding parts of the vein with the thumb and bathe in butter, and mix with that which is in the vicinity of the medicine: and bind with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And care for the outside with bandages, and for the inside with gargles, until the patient is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Thus is this kind of treatment better than an incision and is longer lasting in fear of infection.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And when the vein is healed even with the gentler methods than cautery and incision: it is healed by fumigation, according to this manner.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamine, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and sassafras, and chamomile, and angelica, and similar herbs: and mix these all together, or some of them in a pot, and immerse with vinegar, and let them boil: and the pot should be covered with a lid: and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, above which the instrument is composed according to this manner.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let air or silver issue forth; and let the extremity be introduced into that which contains the pomegranate, until the vapor ascends to the upper opening of the cannula, until the opening becomes much obscured.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over the surface many times, until it boils over.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	Take heed, do not perform this treatment at the beginning of an attack of inflammation.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	Let there be added some plaster in the inflammation: and it is not permitted to do this except when the inflammation has subsided
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If therefore this instrument is not present, then take a tube and fill its extremity with cork or pith: so that the bone of the sick does not burn: for the pith of cork hinders the vapor from burning the bone: and this is an excellent treatment with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Of the extraction of thorns, and bones from the gullet.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Many thorns of fish bones or other things adhere to the gut
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	It is necessary therefore to extract what is apparent on the surface of that which has fallen down, after having passed the tongue with the instrument at the root, and it is declared to be in the gut
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what is not apparent to you and is hidden in the gut, you must make the sick person vomit before the food is digested in the stomach
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps therefore the thing which is annexed will come out with the vomit.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the sick person may swallow down a piece of dates, or the root of lettuce, or swallow down a dry breadcrumb: or take up a dry sponge of sea-moss: and bind it up in a thread, then swallow it down
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When the limb approaches the place where spines or bones are extracted, it is then withdrawn.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If it does not withdraw when pulled as we have said: then use a lead instrument according to this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a radius small, and have a curvature at its extremity, which intrudes into its gut with ease: and let it have its head elevated above itself.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	Beware of its touch of its epiglottis, that it does not cause it to cough, and drive with it bone, spine, or let the physician himself introduce it with his hand
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	Truly that the patient intrudes it is better: because of his science of the place of the annexed thing: and drives downwards, or pulls his hand with the instrument upwards, the whole of this according to the quantity that is prepared for it, until it comes out
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Of the extraction of bloodletting
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When bloodletting is medicated with what I have said in the treatise on curing with the physicians, and it does not help, then consider in the belly of the patient before the sole, or behind the tongue after having moved the tongue with the instrument which I mentioned.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If your hand should slip from the bloodletting, extract it with a small hook, or with fine fingers from the middle.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If this is not possible with these: then take a curved needle, and introduce it into the belly of the patient up to the gut: then introduce the burning iron into the curve of the needle.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this several times: and let the patient abstain from all water throughout the day
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then he shall take a full measure of cold water and open the mouth of the [patient] over it: and he shall gather his jaw with it, and shall not swallow anything from it: and he shall drink the water an hour after the other with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	The blood-sucker will feel the water falling from his lip.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If, however, he does not depart from this as we have said, then he must suffocate the patient with sponges or with a tube as with the cannula of the nose or the ear
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this often, for it is falling from him.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the mode of operation in suffocation is that you take all the urine which is in the bladder with fire: and the vessels be covered with a covering, in the middle of which is a hole: and make an incision in that hole the extremity of the instrument
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then he will expel the suffocation, and place the patient's jaw in the extremity of the cannula, and clamp his jaw, so that it does not depart from the suffocation, until you know that the suffocation has passed to the blood-sucker
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the blood-sucker is immediately falling from him.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall, do the suffocation often again
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And the patient will tolerate sitting, and will eat garlic and onions, and will not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is necessary therefore that he depart from this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the blood-sucker is extracted from the gut when it falls upon the urine.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is like tweezers, like urine: except that it has that curvature which enters the gut
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its extremity is like that of an owl's wing which is called the ciconia, in which there is harshness of the lime: when it grasps something, it does not relinquish it entirely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	And concerning the opening of abscesses, their section, and their care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of abscesses, of various degrees, according as the nature of the pain remembered: for some there is one cause, for others two in this book. They are diverse in their perforation and their sections are of two kinds.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of them is the kind of abscess which arises from moisture.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	The other is due to the place where it occurs in the body
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from one occurring in the foot: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy part is different from one occurring in a joint. And each one of them has its own judgement according to its operation
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And there are abscesses which do not require perforation, except after the ripening of health in the flesh, and the completion of its action: and there are those which require perforation while they are raw and have not ripened according to their completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Like abscesses which are close to joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For an abscess which occurs near a joint and which persists, until it putrefies, that is to say, when the surrounding parts are perhaps corrupted, the ligaments or nerves of that joint may be ruptured. And this is the cause of the closer contraction of that limb
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or an abscess near a main limb: for if you delay its perforation until it ripens, the bone may break or become deformed, or the limb itself will be spoiled
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	If it is close to a bone, perforate it immediately: it does not matter if the abscess is incomplete, except that it be close to the bone, lest it putrefy deeply and reach the intestines, and form a fistula, or remain unhealed at its end.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the time of perforation of the abscess, which is according to the maturity of the lesion: and it is among the relaxation of pain, recession of fever, decrease of redness, pulse, and severity of the headache of the abscess: and the other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	It is necessary that you make the perforation in the lower part of the abscess, and immediately above the apex: and let the perforation be wide in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in the places of lacerations, and strings, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all the places equally, where there is no reflection
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In these, however, which reflect, act with the perforation according to that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When indeed the abscess is in the parts of carnis: then it is better that you delay the perforation of it, until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to the maturity of the lesion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you perforate it before that, you prolong the course of the infection, and there is much pus and dirt, and perhaps the edges of the wound will adhere to each other, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some abscesses are perforated throughout the body according to necessity: or according to that which is necessary for the limb.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer in small abscesses a moderate perforation, and in large abscesses a wide perforation: or multiple sections according to the similarity of the size of the abscesses.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	There are also from the apostemata, in which it is necessary that the skin should be concaved: and it happens when it has been made like a cloth, and has been made at the end, when it is dead: as it happens with many things, as with a dubelet and a bubon.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And there are also those which are cut with a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And there are also those which are cut like the figure of a myrtle leaf
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like the inguinal apostema.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And there are also those in which a round section and a lunar section are administered: and similar things from sections
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	This, however, which has no head, like the superficial leninous apostemata, must be perforated through a superficial perforation, or only with a plane cutting tool
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it must be performed when the apostema is thick, and when it has collected much blood, and you must perforate it so that you do not tear and extract all the pus at once: rather extract from it part of it
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then anoint the apostema until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract some of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times according to the degree, until it has gone: especially if the patient is feeble in spirit, or a woman in childbirth, or a young child, or an old man decrepit: for the spirit of the animal is dissolved from the animal with the evacuation of the blood: and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore take heed of this chapter, for it contains great caution
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after you have perforated the apostema, which you must perforate, you must remove the clot: and consider carefully
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If there is a small abscess of the apostematis, either perform a plane section or administer a dose of laudanum or coto from an old container.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	If the abscess is large and there are many holes in the perforation, it is necessary to introduce medicine into every hole until the bleeding stops
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	If you have excised a piece of skin from the abscess, or if you have cauterized the circumference: then you must apply an old coto, or as when a cloth is taken away, or sprinkle with lint without moisture: and bind it tightly until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove it, and care for it with oil until it is healed
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If, however, blood flow occurs in your operation at the hour, then administer cold water and vinegar, after they have been drunk on a piece of cloth: and put it over the place of the blood flow many times over
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If the bleeding persists, then you must administer regimen, care, and powders, which I have mentioned in many places of this book, and from experience.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If it is in the winter, and the place of the abscess is of many nerves: then you must infuse sponges with wine and warm oil: and put them on the place.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	If it is in the summer, and the place is fleshy: then you must put sponges soaked in water, or oil, or both with wine and oil, and keep it cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until then, as we have said, on the third day you must drain the abscess, evacuate it, and administer treatment that suits it, until it is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is what is necessary for the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses in general
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the sequence of positions, concerning the difference, as I have already said concerning all apostamata, how it is possible to treat it singly.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Concerning the section of the apostomas that occur in the head
Caput XLI.	Concerning the section of the apostomas that occur in the head
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	The small apostomas that occur in the head are of the kind of nodules, which contain sacs, like the houses of hens.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their kind is many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some are fat: and some contain moisture like slime: and some contain moisture like blood clots: and some are like stones
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the section of all of them, and in their extraction, there is no fear, as long as it does not touch the artery during the section
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in the section of these is, as you will experience with the instrument which comes after this, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what it contains
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it contains moisture, then dry it out with the superficial section: in this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	Begin with the incision from point b to point g. When the moisture has been evacuated, remove the sac which contains it, and do not leave anything behind
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	There is much risk of infection if anything is left behind
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the wound in Egyptian unguent, if it is there: and if not, in water and salt: and apply with oil, and remove it on the next day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	The oil will dissolve what remains of the sac
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over the said heel with the second and third fingers, and if you find it still painful, do not trust that it will not recover from the swelling, then take oil and unguent, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the swelling contains a knot of fat: then dry it again in this fashion, by cutting it through in the shape of a cross: and project the nails between the two lobes of the cut, and scour it from every part: and try your skill in extracting the membrane which contains it
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If, however, it opposes you, the artery: then do that which I shall tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly do in a swelling which is bony, by cutting through and curing in the same way as we have said before.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the cutting through of a bony swelling is easier: because there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And whenever there are some hours of swelling which are in the head in some men, when there is no moisture in them.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	Because I have seen over swelling in a woman's head, and I found the swelling like a solid stone, hard, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if it was pierced with anything, it would burst open
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other swellings which happen in the head, except for those which happen in the heads of children, and near the roots of the ears, the cutting should be superficial.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make the perforation always from below upwards, so as to preserve the course of the healing towards the lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then care for it with that which is suitable for it
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	(The provided text does not include any information regarding the section of the thyroid in the neck, so I cannot translate that portion of the sentence.)
Caput XLII.	Head Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	Many wounds occur in the jaw, under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes in other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And above all that occurs from these wounds in the jaw are one, and many: and they are generated from the inside: and every swelling from these wounds is within its own sheath, as in the nodes and the head wounds which we have mentioned
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	There are many kinds of swellings
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And from these things are fatty swellings: and those which contain humors: and malignant swellings which do not obey treatment
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	When, therefore, a good humoral liquid appears in the touch, which is evidenced by its proximity to the color of the skin, and which moves to every part and is not connected with the nerves of the jaw, nor with the veins, nor with the arteries, nor is it deep: it must be excised by a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body from the line A to the line G, and the surrounding skin should be stripped away from all sides: and two lips of skin should be spread out with one or with several sutures, if necessary, as we have said in the head wounds, and the contents should be gradually extracted
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	It is important to take care not to injure the bone or the nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the incision not be acute, but rather wide: so that it does not bring your hand near the incision, or cause the patient pain, and you will cut only what is necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If, however, you cut the bone, or the artery, or if you are forbidden from the operation, then put in the wound some sponge which absorbs blood, or some powder which sheds blood, and tie the wound and leave it until the swelling subsides: or begin to putrefy it
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	The blood is severed by the ligature and hangs ready for the operation until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then inquire with your finger as to whether anything remains of the small trophlets: if so, cut them off and wash them away.</start_of_turn>
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If there is in the root of the trophlet a large vessel: then it is necessary that you do not cut off the latter from its root: but rather that you ligate it with a strong doubled thread, and let it go until it falls off of itself without any nourishment.</start_of_turn>
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then make a hole in the heel of the thigh, which you have immersed in Egyptian unguent.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of yourself.</start_of_turn
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the whole trophlet is cut, then it is necessary that you gather the two lips of the wound: and hold them fast, after which you must wash because there remains no excess.</start_of_turn
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If however you wash and find that there remains excess because of the size of the trophlet, then it is necessary that you bring an incision to the root of the latter and extract it: and administer the suture as we have said.</start_of_turn
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And whatever remains of the trophlets should be perforated with a superficial perforation: so that you may see the seat of its maturity: and put the perforation below that which follows from the lower part of the body as we have said.</start_of_turn
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer after the perforation some lint with unguent, and like that, so that it consumes what remains of the corruption, until when you wash the wound is seen to be healed: then take care of yourself with the unguent of generation of flesh until it is healed.</start_of_turn
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	As for the excision of the epiglottis from the epiglottis to the gut: this happens by chance.</start_of_turn
Caput XLIII.	Head Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	They say that the ancients did this section in the epiglottis, and they did not know of anyone on our land who had done it: and this is the writing of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	But in the case of haemophilus, the surgeon must perform a section of the epiglottis: for if it is not done, there will be no remedy for it: because all the veins and the lung are weakened
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a callous swelling in the mouth, or the gullet, or the two tonsils, when there is no inflammation in the canal, the surgeon must perform a section of the epiglottis in order to escape the destruction that comes from their prolapse.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	It must therefore be performed when we wish to do so, that we cut the epiglottis under three circles of the epiglottis, or four, with a small section through the width, in the place where there is between two circles the quantity which is the section of the cartilage, not in the cartilage itself: and this is the convenient place for the section, because it is bare of flesh, and the blood vessels from it are long.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the surgeon is timid, then it must be extended with the tongue
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then find the skin until it reaches the canal: there will be blood vessels if there is anything there.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then cut the cartilage as we have said: and it is signified above the section of the canal by the phlegm that comes out of it, with that which is broken, and the cutting of the vessel.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And withdraw the wound open at some time
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When the time has passed in which the prolapse takes place, gather together the two lips of the wound with the skin only, without the cartilage
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer the medicines which make the flesh grow until healing is complete.
Inquit Albucasis.	Albucasis wrote: Then administer the medicines which make the flesh grow until healing is complete.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The sum of this sermon which we have narrated is this: an exposed wound cannot be closed until the inflammation has subsided; for when the wound is closed while the inflammation still persists, the patient will die. Therefore it is necessary to leave the wound open until the inflammation has vanished, which is about three days. Then the wound can be closed.</start_of_turn>
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And this which I have heard from myself is that a maidservant once took a knife and put it into her own gut, and it pierced a part of the windpipe.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	I was called to care for her, and I found her already dead, just like a corpse.</start_of_turn>
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I saw that the wound had been opened, and blood had flowed out of it from the little finger.</start_of_turn
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I am confident that she would not have died if she had not been abandoned: neither did she guide herself. The wind was coming out of the wound.</start_of_turn
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I treated her, and closed the wound, and cared for her until she was healed: and the maidservant did nothing else but groan in the water. She recovered after a few days.</start_of_turn
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore it is clear that there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis.</start_of_turn>
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	About the section of the hernia of the gut.</start_of_turn>
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.</start_of_turn>
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This hernia of the gutturis is named after the hernia of the gutturis, and is a great hernia, according to the colour of the body: and it is much in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	It is according to two modes: or it is natural: or it is accidental
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural mode there is no ingenuity
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	Accidental it is according to two modes: one of which is like a swelling of fat.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	The other mode is like a hernia which arises from a knot of an artery
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in this there is fear, and it does not behoove that presumption should be made towards it with the hand, except in the case where it is small: and you must prove it, and investigate it with the intestines.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it like a swelling of fat, and it is not suspected with any other swelling: then dry it up like swellings are dried up: and extract it with the thing which contains it from the bag, if it is in a bag: and if not, then investigate all of it
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with it which should be cured until it is healed
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Of the cutting above the species of swellings.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLV.</start_of_turn>
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many species of swellings, and I have mentioned all the species of them in their order: and it is necessary that I tell you the difference between the Node and the Extrude: in case of doubt
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore, that when the Extrude is cold, and without fever, and without pain which excites, until the ebullition of the superfluous has ceased, and the putrefaction is completed: then indeed the fever and heat cease
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When the Node however is not cold, neither feverish, neither painful, and contains its own bag, which is its own sac, and is according to the colour of the body: and is like a cicer, and makes like a batter, and is greater and less.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	There are two kinds: either fat [tissue] or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	The colours of moisture are many, as I have said in the previous discourse
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	It is necessary therefore, when you are dealing with the Node, to experiment with it and inquire about its character at the outset using the instrument called the Intromissum, as its form will be shown in the following chapter.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	The way to inquire about the posterior parts and the Nodes in general is to take hold of this instrument and introduce it into the moist place which you find in the posterior region: then gradually withdraw your fingers until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then lastly touch the hand according to the measure of the size of the posterior region
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the Intromissum and consider what comes out of its wound
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore moisture runs out, whatever its colour may be: then dry it out with a superficial section, as I have said in the other chapters concerning the posterior region.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	If it does not run out, then you know that it is fat: dry it out therefore with a section having the shape of a cross, as it has been shown to you: and suspend it with sutures, and scrape the skin from all sides with ease: and hold the tissue firm if necessary, until you have extracted the Node safely.</start_of_turn>
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If, however, the bag is burst during the operation, and it is not possible to extract the Node whole, much the same happens in this case: then extract the latter with forceps, until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if anything remains of it, little or much, the Node returns most frequently.</start_of_turn>
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it swells and remains so slightly: then let you insert a thorn into the completion of your work, with some corrosive powders of sharp points: and bind the thorn, and place above it that which sits upon the cold heel, and care for it along with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If there is a large node, then split its two lips and care for it with that which is contained within it
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If, however, there is a contrary swelling which is not pulsating, or which is pulsating: then clean the area thoroughly, and insert a splinter of wood into the place of the bite, and keep it tight for two or three days, until the thorn has rotted and the boiling of the blood has ceased: and then return to the incision which remains of the node.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Of the instruments outside which are for incision and perforation
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	From these are the forms of the instruments which are introduced, and there are three sorts of them.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	From these again are the great, the medium, and the small
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be of iron, square at the extremities and hollow in the middle, that they may hasten the entrance into the heel
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of the instruments of experience, and no, that is, perforating: and one of them is called a beris, that is, a piercer, and there are three sorts of them
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	From these again are the great, the medium, and the small
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They join, that they may be investigated through the heel, and the exit, and the fistula, and the bubble from that which is between the bones
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are round, triangular, blunt, like a great needle which has under it nails, of citrine, or of brass, or of iron, or of silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the better things are those that come from the citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And experience is also obtained from black lead, which joins with these [instruments] so that through them one may experience fistulas, whose cavities reflect like lenity itself with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	There are three things that are of three kinds
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For indeed from these three things are things long, things medium, and things short, according to the quantity of the breadth of the fistula and the stricture of it
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of the needles, and there are many kinds of them
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For indeed from these three things are things simple, namely those which have a single curve: and there are three kinds of them like liquids, great, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from these three things are blind neighbours: and there are three kinds of them
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from these three things are needles having two curves, and there are three kinds of them: and from these three things are needles having three curves, and there are three kinds of them: and all of these are necessary in their place
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels, which cut and scrape nodes and excoriate: and there are three kinds of them: for indeed from these three things are great, medium, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities which make the cut are acute, and the other extremities are not acute: and they are not placed thus, except when there is a deliberate intention for excision of nodes near the fear of the cutting edge of the vein, or the nerve: and in order that the patient may recover more easily from the pain than from the excision of the abscess
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are magdas, and there are three kinds of them
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	The air is their origin, and they are like radium, as with which wine is made: and at their wide end is a hidden Spatumilis point: and within it runs inwards and outwards as desired, like liquids.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The Spatumili form which go between the fingers at the perforation of the apostematum: they are not perceived by the patient: and there are three kinds, great, medium, and small
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The bubbles of the wind when they break up the flow of blood: and there are three kinds, great, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They are from the air, or from citron, round, to a short length, like liquids: and they are solid.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these kinds of bubbles should be great and small among you: so that you can break up blood quickly when necessary, and then when there is no physician present
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	But do not use these substances to break up blood in any part of the body, and do not use them except in carbuncles: such as wounds of the thigh, hip, wounds of the forearm and breasts, and of the belly, groin, and similar carbuncles, humors
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes they are formed from other small things like fragments of sponges, resembling cork: which break up the blood when it flows out from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of the vein, or artery: and sometimes they are formed from round things in this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	As for the care of the breasts of women who are breastfeeding.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	When the breasts of some men swell because of sleep (that is, when they begin to become soiled during sleep) until they resemble the breasts of women: and they remain with post-apoplectic swelling.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever dislikes that [thing], it is necessary that he cut across the breast [area] with a lunar section, according to this shape from the line, b. to the line, g. Then he should remove the whole fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then he should apply a sponge soaked in medicine to the wound
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then he should bring together two lips of the wound with sutures, and care for it until it is healed
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, the breast leans downwards and is softened by its size, as is the case with women: then it is necessary that two similar lunar sections be made in the two upper sides of the breast, each one containing the other at the ends as far as the greater line contains the smaller, according to this shape from the line, b. to the line, g. Then he should remove the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what has been said concerning the sutures and powders, which is necessary for the cure, until it is healed
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If, however, he does not wish to make the incision which is necessary, because of the patient’s anxiety or because of the flow of blood: then it is necessary that he apply a sponge soaked in corrosive unguent under the coat, and let it go, until that which remains of the fat has been corroded.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	As for the perforation of the apostem, which occurs under the nipple
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These apostemas which occur under the nipple are of the kind of hard Stropharia, which contain vesicles, and from which are exuded humors.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	These are exuded from the humors which contain the moisture, it is necessary that they be cut with a lunar section, according to this shape from the line b. to the line g. when all that is in the apostema is evacuated from the flesh, then apply a sponge to the surrounding area and let it go until the next day
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the foot is lifted up, and is cared for with an unguent suitable for it, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the swelling were from a kind of knot of the Strophulas, then it is to be cut above it, as we said in the section on the Strophulas which are equal
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	But if a swelling occurs in this way as to discharge pus, then in this case apply cautery to it, as we said before
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	As for the cutting of the swelling that occurs from the Artery and Vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.</start_of_turn>
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When the Artery is ruptured, and the skin above it is consolidated, then much swelling immediately occurs from the swelling: and in the same way swelling also occurs in the Vein, as it does in the swelling and the inflation.</start_of_turn>
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that the swelling and inflation are from the Artery and Vein are: for when the swelling is from the Artery, it is long, aggregated in the depth of the body: and when the swelling of the hand is made by pressing upon the digits, you feel as if there is a constriction there.</start_of_turn
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is from the Vein is rounded in the open part of the body.</start_of_turn>
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the cutting above this swelling is dangerous, and especially when it is under the armpits, and in the groin, and the throat, and in many other parts of the body: and it is a great danger.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore it is necessary to take care of it with fire, and that from iron also is in the extremities, or in the head, it is necessary to take care of it.</start_of_turn
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Because of that which is from the iron is from the swelling of the orifice of the Artery, find in the cutting of the skin in the length.</start_of_turn
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the part with hooks, afterwards the Artery: and release the gut from the tunics, until it is severed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert the hook under it and make the gut penetrate until the other side, and ligate the Artery with two threads in two places, as you were taught in the extraction of two Arteries which are in the abdomen
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then bite the place which is between two ligatures with a sponge, until the blood which is in it comes out, and it is dissolved after the swelling has gone down.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then give treatment which causes pus to form, until the ligatures fall away: afterwards care for it with suitable unguents until it is healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If there should be swelling on account of the cutting of a Vein, then it is necessary to put in your hand what is possible from the swelling with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert the hook under the place where you held your hand, and make the gut penetrate: and there put in two threads, until you draw it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then ligate with the gut itself the ligature with good thread: according to what I told you concerning the ligature of the vein, from two parts with two extremities of thread
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another hook with another thread under the whole swelling at the incision of the needle: first, and ligate your thread in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry the swelling in the middle of it, until when it comes out what is in it: then cut off the excess of the skin, and discharge what is ligated from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put upon it a little puff which you submerged in wine, and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then give treatment which is done with poultices and unguents, until it is healed
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Of the swelling that arises from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Of the swelling that arises from the twisting of nerves.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as swelling arises in arteries and veins, in the same way swelling arises in nerves: that which arises from percussion in the body, or from excessive labor, or in a similar way: and it is most frequent in the armpits, or at the ankle, and in every place where there is a joint movement: and it is a serious swelling.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	It is similar in color to the rest of the body, and is in various positions without pain: and when it is compressed with pressure, a pain similar to that of drunkenness is felt in it
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	It is not a deep swelling of the body, but rather under the skin, and it moves to all parts, and does not go forward or backward or to the back
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Which is why it is in the joints, it does not need to be grasped with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps also there will be a contraction.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	But in that which is in the head, or in the face, find the skin with a spatula.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If it is a small swelling, then hold it with forceps, and cut it off from its root
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a thread, and scrape it off: then remove it, and join it together with a suture: and care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Of the excision of the swelling which is in the belly.</start_of_turn>
Caput LI.	Of the excision of the swelling which is in the belly.</start_of_turn
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	These occur in many people in the bellies, and in the rest of their bodies, those which are called Fungalia, because of their resemblance to fungi
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Whose root is slender, and their head is bulky, and their lips are joined together.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And they are of the small intestines: and they are of the small intestines which grow large upwards
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And indeed I saw a man, and in his belly there were two tumours, which were greater than the rest like mushrooms: there was no difference between them, white or dark, root or top: they joined together and moisture ran out of them always.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I cut them off, and I found in the weight of one almost twenty-eight ounces and in the other about six ounces. And the operation in their incision is, as you consider, if the patient is humid, and the colour of the tumours is white, humid, slender root: then cut through with a wide spatula, and there will be in your presence their caeca in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	Much blood is expelled at the cutting of it: take care therefore if you are splashed by blood, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see a sick man weak and timid from the incision with the iron, then take a leaden thread from the middle and string it with it: whose method is as we have said, and let him go in two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add lead in stricture.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Do not cease to string the lead until it is broken, and it falls down without toil
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If however the tumours be large of the root, then in their incision there is something fearful and painful: especially because of that which is in the belly
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	But indeed it is possible to cut through the middle of them.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, that it does not return
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for yourself until you are healed of the wound.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	Then care for yourself until you are healed of the wound.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	Then care for yourself until you are healed of the wound.
Caput LII.	Then care for yourself until you are healed of the wound
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	Then care for yourself until you are healed of the wound
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Then care for yourself until you are healed of the wound
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Then care for yourself until you are healed of the wound
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Then care for yourself until you are healed of the wound
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	Then care for yourself until you are healed of the wound
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	Then care for yourself until you are healed of the wound
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	Then care for yourself until you are healed of the wound
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	Then care for yourself until you are healed of the wound
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	Then care for yourself until you are healed of the wound
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	Then care for yourself until you are healed of the wound
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	Then care for yourself until you are healed of the wound
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	Then care for yourself until you are healed of the wound
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in this case there is fear and dread, as I taught thee in the chapter where I spoke of the posset due to the artery and the vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the swelling of the belly is from the intestine or the bladder: then it is necessary to make the patient spit out whatever he is swallowing, as long as he continues to swallow, and to keep him standing extended
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then signs with encasement all around the belly.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then command him to lie down between your hands on his back
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then surround with a wide sponge around the belly in the place which you indicated with encasement.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the middle of the incision upwards with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind it firmly around with strong thread, or with silk cord: and let the knot of the ligation be firm.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the incision which has been extended above the ligation.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you find that the thing which is captured by the ligation: then extract the encasement and introduce the finger into it, and push the intestine into the belly: and if you find the bladder, then grasp it with the hook, and cut off its excess
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	But if it is the artery or the vein: then surround it a great deal.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your work.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and introduce them into the two corners of the wound: and introduce two needles around the circumference which you made around the incision in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tighten the wound in four places on the needles: and if you wish, take out the needles and leave the wound open until the extended flesh has decayed: and it will fall away by itself: or cut it away when it becomes thin and has decayed
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for yourself with what is necessary from unguents until you are healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If there is swelling of the belly from the flesh or from moisture: then it is necessary to make an incision above the navel, as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And drain blood, or moisture, as you find in it.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then care for yourself with what is necessary from unguents until you are healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De cura CANCRI.	About the care of cancer.</start_of_turn
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.</start_of_turn>
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already said in the discourse concerning the kinds of cancer, and how it is useful to care for it with physicians: and we must be cautious with it when caring for it with iron, so that we do not ulcerate it: and we have said that cancer is generated in the matrix, and we must be cautious of its care.</start_of_turn
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients have said that sometimes when cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible: such as cancer that is in the breast, or in the thigh, and those that are like these, from the members located to be extracted throughout: especially when it is in its beginning and small.</start_of_turn
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When it is old and great, it is not necessary to approach it.</start_of_turn
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	I cannot cure anyone from it: nor do I know of anyone who has ever cured it.</start_of_turn
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation in it, when it is located as we have said, is to precede and extract the diseased part from black bile several times.</start_of_turn
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then make a phlebotomy if you find it with a visible swelling.</start_of_turn
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient before the operation, when he is located with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then place him on the table which is suitable for him.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then draw out all the nails from every part with the skin, according to the prescription, until nothing remains of his roots: and let the blood flow freely, and do not cut him too quickly, but rather express the place, and drain the thick blood as much as possible with your hands, or with whatever instruments are available
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, there is excessive flow of thick blood from an artery or vein: then cauterize the vein, until the bleeding stops
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with the rest of the treatment, until he is healed
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	(Text continues with another section of the translation
Caput LIIII.	(End of translation
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We shall speak in detail of the varieties of hydrosis, and how water is gathered: and the signs of every kind, and their treatment by physicians.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And what is cured with iron is not except for a single kind of ascites: and it is not approached with iron in the case of tympanitic species: neither in the case of profound hypostatic species: for that is deadly
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you are treated for this kind of hydrosis which is tympanitic with the physicians, and your treatment does not please them: then consider it
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the patient is followed by weakness, or with any other illness besides hydrosis: such as if there is also cough, or solution of the intestines, and similar things: then do not give him iron for that would be dangerous
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If, however, you see the patient overflowing with spirits, neither young nor old: then the mode of operation in this case is that you raise the patient between your hands, and after expressing his belly push down his intestines with your hand, driving out the water downwards to the lower part of the abdomen
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take the sponge, thorny, according to this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Then take the sponge, thorny, its shape like that of Spatumile.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	Indeed there is something of shortness in it, proceeding gradually, so that it does not pass through to the intestines during the operation, and so it heals the wound itself.
Deinde considera.	Then consider carefully.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if there is a discharge of hydrosis from the intestines, then it is necessary to lengthen the incision from the navel to the lower part in a straight line above the pelvis by the measure of three fingers
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If indeed the discharge of hydrosis is because of liver disease: then make your incision to the left of the navel by the measure of three fingers
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	If the discharge is from the spleen: then make the incision on the right side; and it is not necessary to make the incision on the side where you wish to place the sickly person, so that there are no protrusions to the place of weakness
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce with the instrument the whole skin
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce the hand with the sponge between the skin, and sponge, as if you are scraping: and the amount that should be scraped is equal to the amount of a nail, or somewhat less.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the sponge until the sponge reaches the hollow: and that is the place of water
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then remove it and introduce it into the hole of the instrument whose form is this.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	It is like a tube: made of silver, or of air, or of gold, flexible, thin: which has a small hole at the lower part, and three holes at the sides, two from one side and one from the other: and its extremity is cut, like the incision of a needle, as for an abscess: at its upper part is a collar
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	When the instrument reaches the water, it immediately sinks over the instrument, thus evacuating half its quantity from the water in an hour.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	If you evacuate more from it than is necessary, the patient may die in an hour from the collapse of his vital spirit: or there may occur to him fainting which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	Evacuate from it according to its quantity and according to what is significant to you concerning the condition of the patient from the strength of his pulse and from his health
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then withdraw the instrument and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	Because it remains immediately because of the skin which retains the opening above the siphon: as I have said, perform it according to the usual method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on the other side, if you find the patient tolerates it: and also evacuate from the water the quantity which remains.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this several times without fear, and take care of yourself from an error: until there remains from the water only a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	If however you fear for the patient, and you discharge from the water much: then care for him with burying in warm sand, and with much sweating in a bath and in the sun, and expect above the seat: and care for him with physicians skilled in healing, until he is healed: and cauterize on the stomach, and the spleen, and the liver, after the water is drawn out: as I have said previously
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Concerning the care of infants who are born in places where the urine ducts are not pierced.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When anyone is born from the womb of his mother, and the head of him is not pierced through, or the opening is strict, or is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	It is necessary therefore to assist immediately when a perforation occurs since it is born with Spatumili in a subtle form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put in the wound a small lead weight, and bind it: and keep it for three days, or four.</start_of_turn>
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When he wishes to urinate, move him, and mix.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce it.</start_of_turn>
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put in lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the place will not allow it to close.</start_of_turn>
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	He whose wound is strict is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is enlarged.</start_of_turn>
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	He in whom the wound is in its wrong place, they cauterize.</start_of_turn
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is because from the matter which is born, the wound is at the end of the hair of the beard: wherefore it cannot mix forward until the beard has risen above it.</start_of_turn>
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Neither is there any generation, for the sperm cannot reach the matrix according to its straight course: and it is a wound of the subtle form.</start_of_turn
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the manner of the operation in this is that the sick man lies on his back.</start_of_turn>
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the hair of the beard with your left hand, with extension of the thumb: and cut the head of the hair of the beard from its root, with a needle, or with a sharp spatumili: as is the cutting of the tip of a reed, or as you would a nail, so that its middle comes out like the head of the beard: and that the wound be in the middle according as it should be.</start_of_turn
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware you at your operation from the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Much happens with that.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Counteract it with that which binds the blood, and care for the wound until it is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	As for the things which happen in the preparation of the wound and the head of the vein, and corruption, blackening, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LXVI.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	Many things happen with these matters in the flesh, and it is the elevation of the diseased part of the flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And among these there are some which are malignant and some which are not malignant
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	The malignant ones must be suspended with a fine thread and cut away, until the whole thing is cleansed.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place over the wound a soaked bandage in Egyptian unguent
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	And care for the wound afterwards with a soft unguent, until it is healed
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the matter is malignant, of the colour of flesh, then it is necessary to administer in it a cautery after its incision and for its reason
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If, however, the matter is in the head of the vein, not circumcised, and is a part of the matter which is inside the preparation, and a part of it which is outside: then it is necessary to stretch out the matter which is inside first, until it is consolidated, and then care for the outside: for if you care for the outside while you are caring for the inside, the preparation will be ruptured.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And also in the testicles, and the blackening of the preparation and corruption
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	It is necessary therefore that you remove everything which has become blackened, and which is about to corrupt, or which has already corrupted
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then line above the hip beyond that which was struck with the cress of wheat with barley grits and trefoil herbage.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If blood flows, then apply a lunar cautery, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	A cautery is applied twice in two positions simultaneously, that is, to the flow of blood and to the ulcer when it is ruptured
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the worm has been consumed and the whole thing is destroyed in an hour: then it is necessary to introduce lead shot into the belly of the patient so that the poison may mix with the blood above it
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In connection with the application of the bandage with the head of the worm, and this connection does not occur except in that case in which the bandage is sound and not required above it; and when this connection does occur because of the ulcer or fistula: it is necessary to scrape off the skin above it with blunt spatulas until the ligament is severed and the head of the worm is freed from all around
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to discern these things, then it is necessary to scrape something from the head of the worm and from the bandage
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	For the bandage is often perforated because of its slightness and speed
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the bandage from the head of the worm with a fine linen cloth which has been made wet in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat with balsamic wine, until it is solidified
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	Of the treatment of infants, and the treatment for an error in an accident
Caput LVII.	Head Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not the solution for the continuity of the wound, like the rest of the wounds: indeed when it comes from our operation, our will, and the purpose of the same is in the children themselves, it is necessary that we mark in this operation a better operation, and the loss of some sensitivity for the purpose of health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say, therefore, that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: because they did not use it in their laws, and it is not except what we have acquired through experience
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	Because I have found a greater part of the artifices, and phlebotomists, useful for the modification of the world, by circumcision with a needle, and with scissors: and they make use of glue and ligature with thread, and incision with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have proved all these methods, and I have not found a better modification than with scissors, and ligation with thread
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in the modification with a needle, much skin is lost.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the skin of the prepuce has two tunics: therefore sometimes the upper skin is cut, and the lower tunic is threatened: it is therefore necessary to make an incision to cut the other one, and to prevent future pain
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when the modification is made with glue, which is what surgeons do, namely with digits, as they use them, the incision of the extremity of the penis is not secured: for perhaps it enters through its foramen
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In the modification, however, with a nail, perhaps the iron will go awry, and will corrupt your operation: and the skin of the child is short of nature, and many are born thus, which does not require circumcision: and I advise you of that.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	The use of scissors and ligature with thread proved advantageous: for it was observed that the size of the scissors is in proportion to the length of the incision.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When you grasp the hand in this way, the two acuities are in proportion, and they are cut together in the same time: and there results a compression similar in form, containing the skin all around, except for a part which does not slip at all
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	The proper way to perform the operation is to make the opening as small as possible, especially if there are people present who are learned in small matters, for you must not do anything except to ligate the thread in the vein itself: and you must dismiss it until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way possible for him, from which he receives his understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your hands prepared to grasp, and do not sit down: and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boys see them neither, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into the vein and blow air into the skin, and draw it up, until the head of the vein comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then close up that which has gathered in that mess
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then ligate the marked place with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then ligate the lower part somewhat less tightly than the upper part.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then take hold with your index finger and thumb of the place of the lower ligation and hold it securely, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin upwards quickly, and pull out the head of the vein.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then discharge the blood slowly (for it is better thus) and apply powder above: and above the powder put a bag containing the expanded testicles or decocted in rose water, which has been well shaken with recent olive oil: discharge it upon that until the next day: and take care of the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The form of the forceps for this procedure is as follows.</start_of_turn>
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Two handles extend at an angle, and the handles are joined: do not protrude beyond the thumb: and their length should be equal to the length of two thumbs together.</start_of_turn>
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	The real danger in dressing lies in the cutting through of the whole skin or a part of it at the incision.</start_of_turn
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore it is necessary to extend the limb from your hour hand with your thumb before the displacement of the tissue: and make the incision according to the equality.</start_of_turn
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you are unable to hold the limb with your thumb, then grasp it with the index finger and make the incision.</start_of_turn
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If, however, after three days, there remains something under the swelling which is still inflated, evacuate it: then discharge the swelling when it has become soft, and cleanse it gently, and make the incision as before: and be careful from the head of the swelling.</start_of_turn
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	It will not cause him any harm.</start_of_turn
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Take care of it as we have said in the treatise on powders: and if it breaks through the skin above the measure, and reaches the upper part, it will not harm him even then.</start_of_turn>
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Take care of it as we have said until he is healed.</start_of_turn
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	On the extraction of the retained kidney from the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	On the extraction of the retained kidney from the bladder.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the bladder is done by means of stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or native flesh, or like things from which we have spoken in the methods of treatment for dropsy.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the kidney is not cured, and the retention of urine is attributed to a stone which is in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that it be loosened over its knee
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then the feet of the kidney are bound over its back, and the belly is pulled out from its upper part of the back, and the diseased part is held down as much as possible
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	It is thought therefore when the neck of the bladder is towards the back for the expulsion of the stone: the kidney is absolutely expelled
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	And if it does not succeed as we have said: and if something else remains over the diseased part: then it is necessary to perform the extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, which is like a tube of silver, slender and rounded like a feather quill in the thickness of a palm and a half: and there is a small tube in its head
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of extracting the kidney itself is as follows: you take a doubled thread and bind it at its end with wool or cotton, a good ligation: and you insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and you cut with scissors if anything comes out from the wool, truly insert into the tube with certainty, as with a nail.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then wash the syringe with oil, or butter, and alum: and make the patient sit on a seat, and support the bladder, and give him a drink of warm oil and water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then introduce the needle into the flesh easily, until it reaches the root of the vein.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double the thread above the navel
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the needle inside itself until it reaches the bladder, and let the patient feel that the needle has reached its destination: this is not done according to this order unless the tissue through which the needle passes is flexible
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then draw out the thread slowly with the lancet.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	The vein follows the lancet
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then pull out the needle, and cause the vein to run along the urine: and do this again with the needle, and do not stop doing this until the bladder is evacuated and the patient feels relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Regarding the quality of the catheterization of the bladder with Clepshydra
Caput LIX.	Chapter 59
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When there is a wound in the bladder, or the blood is frozen or clotted in it, or pus is formed, and the urine is distilled into water and medicines: then use the instrument called Clepshydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is blunt, that is, closed
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And there are three holes in it, two from one side, and one from the other side, like urine
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the part which drives it, where the needle is inserted, should be according to the quantity which you wish to use without adding anything, until when it is drawn out with it something is attracted from the humilities: and when it is driven out, when it is expelled at length: according to what the Clepshydra does, which throws out pitch, that is, Greek fire in the fields of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When any liquid is poured over the cavity, introduce the extremity of the sponge into the liquid and draw up what drives it upwards, for the liquid is thus drawn into the concavity of the sponge.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce its extremity into the cavity, as we have said in the syringe
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then drive the liquid with that which drives it, and the liquid will immediately follow to the cavity, as the patient will feel
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	Form a soft enema which fills the cavity
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be of silver or gold: whose head is higher like a small bowl, and under it the sinus between which the ligament falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take hold of the bladder, and place in it the liquid which will cause it to swell
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind the two sinuses with strong thread with a double knot: and heat the liquid slightly over fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the extremity of the enema into the cavity, afterwards close your hand over the bladder with the liquid tightly bound downwards, until the patient feels that the liquid has already reached the bladder
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If however there is no liquid in the bladder, then take hold of a piece of parchment and make of it a circle, and pierce it through from all its roundness
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then introduce a strong thread firmly through these holes, as they are being made
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle, as a ball of wool is gathered: after you have put into it that which you wish of humdities, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind it in an instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder when expressing with your hand, until the liquid reaches the bladder
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	On the Extraction of the Stone.
Caput LX.	On the Extraction of the Stone.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken concerning the types of stone and their treatment by physicians: and we have mentioned the difference between a stone generated in the bowels and a bladder stone, and the signs of the former: and we have mentioned that the operation for the latter is performed with the hand and incision: and this is a stone generated in the bladder itself: and that which is found in the urine: and I shall speak of this with manifest exposition and brevity.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore, that a stone generated in the bladder is most frequent among children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs it is known that the urine flows from the bladder like water in its turbidity: and there appears in it white sand, and it irritates the painful bladder, and causes it to hang down with much straining
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is erected, and goes out with the anus in many people.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the healing of children from this is easy, until the age of fourteen years has passed
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in old age.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In youth, however, there is a middle course between these two: and the greater the stone, the easier the cure: and if small, the care of it is less laborious
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we come to the cure, it is necessary in the first place to evacuate the patient with a cathar, which extracts all the stool from his intestines: which indeed often hinders the discovery of the stone at the inquiry
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the patient should be taken with his feet, and struck, and moved downwards: so that the stone descends to the depth of the bladder, or goes out from its high place in parts
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and let his hands rest under his buttocks, so that the belly will hang down completely to the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then ask him, and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If you feel a stone in the space, then immediately take hold above it with the section (scissors).
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must remove the index finger of the left hand if the patient is young: or the middle finger if he is complete: and introduce it into the belly of the patient, and ask about the stone, until it rests under your finger: and bring it gradually to the neck of the belly
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press above it with your finger, and push it outwards against the place where the section is to be made: and command the minister to clamp the belly with his hand, and command another minister to stretch the testicles of his right hand upwards: and another hand to move the skin which is under the testicles in the part from the place where the section is to be made
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then introduce the sponge soaked in wine, which has this form.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between the belly and the testicles, and not in the middle, on the left side of the navel: and let the section be above the stone, and your finger in the rectum: and make a transverse section, so that the external section is wide and the internal section is narrow, according to the quantity that is possible for the escape of the stone from that which is not greater
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps the finger that is in the rectum will press the stone at the section and it will come out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that from the stone there are angles and edges, because of which its exit is difficult because of that
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from this is soft, like a gland, and round: and it makes easy the egressus of its.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	And from this are angles and margins added to the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	And if it does not come out thus, then it is necessary that you bring in over it: or that you bind over it with a grip whose extremity is like the Moon, which binds over the Stone, and does not yield to it: or that you insert under it a subtle instrument, with curved extremities
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	But if you cannot overcome it with these, then widen the opening nearby
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	And if anything of blood incites you, cut it off with a saw
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	And if there are more than one stone, then push in the first one to the bone of the hip
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut over it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push out the hand after that: and do the same if there are more than two
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	And if it is great, then ignorance is not enough to cut through it with a great section
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For it happens to a sick man of two things, either that he should die, or that there is an excessive concentration of urine: because the place is not consolidated at all
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But manage its expulsion until it comes out: or bring in a fracture of it with forceps until you have extracted it frustratedly
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then apply a sponge of wool, aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it up, and place over it a soaked bandage of oil and wine, or oil of roses and cold water: so that the swelling will subside.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then rest the patient on his side, and do not move the ligaments, until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have finished the operation, embroider the place with water, and pour much.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with a soft bandage and a basic dressing until it is healed
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If, however, in the wound a hard swelling appears, and pus, and similar things: thus also if blood is congealed in the bladder, and is withheld from that by urine: this is recognized from the emission of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Introduce your finger into the wound, and draw out the clot of blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it causes corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and oppose all sorts of things with that which is suitable for the cure, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary in the course of the cure of all these things, to bind up two thighs, and to support, for the cause of the physicians who place things upon the place
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If the stone is small, and is in the cavity of the bladder, and is fixed in it, and prevents the passage of urine: then care for it with that which I mentioned before until you reach the point of incision
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many are excused from the incision for this cure, because I have proved that to be the case.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, that you take a needle of steel, which has this shape, triangular extremities, acute, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take thread, and bind with it under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then introduce the perforating needle into the bladder with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone: and withdraw the perforator slowly from the stone: and make a hole in it, until you make it penetrate from the other side
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	The urine is indeed immediately effective.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then lay your hand over what remains of the stone from the outside of the bladder
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	It itself will break, and go out with the urine, and will heal the sick person
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this treatment is not prepared for him, because of something that hinders it: then bind a thread under the stone, and a thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry over the stone in the very bladder between the two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then draw it out.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then loosen the ligament, and massage the clotted blood, which is in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to bind a thread under the stone, except that it does not go back to the bladder: and the other thread above, except when the thread is drawn out after the stone has gone, the skin returns to its place, and helps the wound: and for this reason it is necessary for you to bind the upper thread, so that it raises the skin upwards, so that it returns to its original position, and helps the wound, as we have said
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	Of the extraction of a stone from women
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXIX
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Stones are hardly generated in women
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If however it happens to one of them that a stone comes about, then the treatment is difficult, and is prohibited because of many things.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	Among these things: that a woman is perhaps a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, that you will not find a woman who will disclose herself to a doctor when she is a virgin, or who is married
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	Thirdly, for you will not find a woman well learned in this art, especially in performing surgery with her hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	Fourthly, the distance from the stone to the bone is great: whereupon a deep section is needed, and there lies fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If such a case necessitates it, then you must take a female physician, who is well learned: for few are found
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	Or if you wish to take a surgeon, take a learned and discreet man, and present to him a skilled woman in matters of women, or one who has learned a part of this art: make her present, and especially tell her of the matter concerning the stone
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	Firstly, if she is a girl, let her look at her palm: then she must insert her finger into her palm and seek the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If she finds it, she should grasp it under her finger, and then tell the obstetrician to insert her finger into the lower belly of the patient, and inquire about the stone after she has placed her left hand on the heel and pressed it well
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If she finds the stone, then she must gradually move it from the opening of the belly to the lower parts with all her skill, until she has brought it down to the root of the pelvis.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she will feel the stone in that part: and her hand must not be moved from the stone, holding it under it: and make a small incision at first
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then insert the radium over that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If she feels the stone, then add to the incision a quantity that is proportionate to how much the stone comes out from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that there are many kinds of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	Moreover, some are small and some are large, some are soft and some are rough, some are long and some are round, having branches
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	You know, therefore, the kinds of them, as is signified by this above concerning that which you desire.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If blood has therefore flowed [onto the stone], then add in the place of the wound some powdered alum, and keep it for an hour, until the blood is separated.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation until the stone has gone: and do this prepared with the instruments which I mentioned for the extraction of the stone from the bladder, so that you may aid in this operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If blood flows from an artery which has been cut: then put powder on the place and bind it with threads of moderate size: and do not stop it: and let the stone go, and do not try to extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the woman is weak.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then take care of the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When the pain of the blood has subsided after a few days, and the place has become putrid, then return to your operation until the stone has gone
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	Of the incision concerning the watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery hernia is not except for the collection of moisture in the white membrane which is under the testicles containing eggs: and it is called a hernia.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And when it is in the proper pouch of the testicles which nature has prepared for it in the part of the egg, until it is burst: which is another egg, and is the membrane of the testicles between the white membrane which we mentioned: and it does not happen except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this branch is from the weakening which occurs in the testicles: whereupon it flows to them this matter.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or it is of a yellow-orange color, or it is reddish-bloodstained, or dark green, black, or white fluid, and this is the best.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the gathering of the water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white sac which we mentioned, then the swelling is round to the length like the figure of a yes: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from every side
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if it is in the inner sac itself, then the swelling is round with a part like a yes, and because of this the man knows that there is another one.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sac, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore one has cognition of the color of the moisture, then to experience the color of the moisture in the swelling with an introduced square whose form precedes.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that therefore which proceeds from the introduction, judge of that which is between them
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary to expel the patient, to draw blood from him if possible, and to fill his body with liquid
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then it is rested upon its back over a high low thing, and put under it many cushions
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you on its left side, and command the minister, that he sit on its right side, who extends his arm towards one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and towards the part which is between the navel and the genitals
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad sponge and dry the testicles from the middle to the loin: and make an incision following the straight line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white fat encompassing them: and scrape it out and observe, or else cut it out directly. And let your scraping be such as to remove only as much as is necessary.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then drain the testicles with a wide opening, and extract all the fluid.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the scrotum upwards, without touching the testicles encompassing them: and make an incision in the scrotum as you deem necessary, either completely or partially, especially its broad side superficially
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine it, there will be no security in the incision, for the water will flow out.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	If, however, anything exterior to the skin comes out in the course of your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the scrotum, reduce it
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then join together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with sutures.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it like the rest of the wound, until it heals
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find anything corrupt from blackness else, then you must ligate the vessels which are the source of blood flow
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then remove the testicle with its suspending ligament, and extract the fluid: afterwards care for it as we have said
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If indeed water has gathered in two parts, then you know that there are two branches: dry therefore the other part equally as you did the other
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	If the blood is equal, let the operation be one, then withdraw the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	If the blood is equal, let the operation be one, then withdraw the blood.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths and soak them, and apply the one to the carmine, according to this likeness: and let the extremities be those which are sent forth from the knee, or moist wool: and gather with the stricture at the waist of the arms: and one extremity shall take over one foot until the loin, and the second shall take over to the part of the loin: and the two extremities shall take over over the two lower thighs, and the two extremities shall take over over the two inguinal regions, and gather the stricture throughout the waist of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And when it is necessary to treat this wound with a cautery in the place of the incision with a knife: and it is that you take a fine cautery knife and cut with it the skin of the testicles: and it is ignited, according to what we have said: until it is seen that there is white fat containing water: then take the cautery, according to this shape
Assimilatur literae graecae.	Thus it is like the Greek letters
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce with it that fat, and it is ignited, until all the moisture has gone out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then stretch the fat with hooks, and scour with the cautery a little ignited, and cut itself according to what is possible to you, until you have excised all of it
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And burn from outside, so that it does not touch the fire.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And you know that this operation is safer and longer from the flow of blood, and better than the operation with a section.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, the operation should cause adversity in the hour of incision, or in the hour of cauterization after the scab has cooled, or in the flow of blood, or anything else: then it is necessary that you should treat the adversity that the operation has caused with the treatment which is appropriate for it.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If, however, the patient is timid and does not expect such a great operation on account of his horror: then I administer perforation according to what I have narrated above: and thus.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are certain that it is necessary for you to do this with regard to the signification which we have mentioned concerning the liquid: then you must make the patient sit on a raised seat
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then perforate the scab in the lower part of it with a wide spatula: and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and keep the opening wide open until the whole liquid has been discharged
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place upon the place of the buttock, and bind it, and let it go so that the remaining liquid may be discharged: then care for it until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If, however, adversity should exist in the hour when you perforate it: and this is not except for the fact that a white bubble causes adversity in the opening of the wound and hinders the discharge of the liquid: then you must either introduce a needle into the wound, or an instrument with which the watery humors are extracted, whose form has preceded: or to add to the operation of the wound a little of the substance which has been mentioned.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And you know that the liquid returns and gathers after six months, or thereabouts.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it gathers again, then it must be returned in the same way, and the patient will recover his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	(The text continues with instructions for the care of a wound.)
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the upper part of this Rami, there is a terror that proceeds from the bowels and causes harm in many positions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore it is seen that its dismissal is hindered from there.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I remember the operation in this respect, and the appearance of the pus afterwards
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say, therefore, that many abscesses happen in the bodies, from which testicles are formed: and this is from the swelling of many wounds
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from excessive and acute swelling, or acridness, which flows down to the testicles
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and it is not found to cause pain: and it is a serious abscess
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in it
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it happens from the bursting of arteries, and the swelling of these: as I have mentioned before in this respect: or from the swelling of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Therefore it is known from the position of the abscess, when you press it with your fingers
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not right to touch it directly
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	But that which happens from the swelling of veins, does not disperse from that by pressing with the fingers
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is possible that over this kind of abscess there should be a cutting, and over the rest of the flesh: and it is to remove the skin of the testicles
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then stretch out the limb upwards, and pull it out with a white bandage: and remove the pus from the bowels, and ligate the vessels: and cut off the abscess once you have freed it from all sides of the limb.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If any solid object is joined with these natural bones, then it is necessary to pull out the object and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	If any adhesion exists between some bones, or in that which there is between the viscera: then it is necessary to free the entire adhesion and make an incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If, however, there is an outgrowth of flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary to cut through all of it, and pull out the object, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When your operation is complete, then place a sponge wetted with oil in the wound, and wine: then care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	As for the care of the limb, which is with the thread.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 122.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Uitis is swelling of a limb which is surrounded by swelling, like a bag, with the softening of the testicles: and it makes difficult the movement and exercise, and walking
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this ailment is fear, because of which there is a remembrance of the thing which preceded it
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	Indeed it is necessary to say that the operation is done in this one according to what the first did
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore, that it is necessary to make the infirm person sit on a raised seat
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the testicles downwards.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the testicles with your fingers, with the nails towards the hairs: and hold them with another, and extend them with an extension of the limbs
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then make an incision with a sharp knife in a transverse direction across the middle of the bones, until the bones are revealed
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then from every part, as we said before in the extraction of arteries which are in their season.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then fix in a curved clamp in which the thread is doubled, and bind it at the first point where it comes into contact with the veins: and bind it again at the last of these.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then dry them in the middle section straight according to the length of the body, and extract what is aggregated from the humours of corrupt faeces.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for the wound along with the care of the other wounds, in which is the desire to generate health, so that the suppuration which nourishes one testicles falls away.
Non est enim malum per illud.	There is nothing bad in this.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	If however the veins should happen to bleed in all the wounds, then it is necessary to extract the testicles with the veins: so that they do not lack nourishment by incision, and that they do not become black and swollen, and that they do not suffer damage with the clamp
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	On the care of the intestines.
Caput LXV.	Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The event of this Ramus is from the section which happens in the large intestine above the belly in the groin part from the wonders of the belly.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Because the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the siph or from the extension of this
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two kinds happen from various diseases: either from a blow, or from a jump, or from a cry, or from an elevation of a heavy thing, and the like
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign when it is from the extension of the siph.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	Is that which happens gradually in a long time, and does not happen immediately: and is a swelling equal in height to the depth: because the siph compresses the intestine
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And its sign when excised from the bowels is that it immediately causes pain and swelling: and it is a diverse after-effect, appearing under the skin nearby: and this is because of the escape of the intestine, and its course to the exterior of the bowels.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And when it goes out with the intestines it is called the intestinal hernia, and strangulation: and when it is with swelling
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And when it runs into the intestines it retains the stool there: and this is with great danger to the patient: because it causes pain in the lower abdomen, and especially when it is pushed out.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of this disease with iron there is fear: because of this the case should be guarded against.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is to push out the intestines from the abdomen of the patient, so that they return to their natural cavity
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	And then it is laid back over its collar between your hands: and raise up its edges.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	And then spread out the skin which follows the skin upwards, and dry the whole of the testicles thoroughly
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	And then fix in two hooks two needles of sectioning, according as it is necessary to open the section with the instrument: and the section should be made according to the amount which is possible, so that it may escape from it all things
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	And then remove the fat under the skin, and that which is under the testicles, until the white intestine, hard from all parts, is detected: then insert your finger into that which follows the testicle, in that which is between the white intestine and the intestines, and between the intestines themselves and the whole with that which is in the back of the testicle.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move your right hand to the inside of the skin of the testicles: and with this extend a white patch upwards with your left hand: and elevate one with the white patch to the part of the section: and command the minister to extend the other upwards: and you shall solve the adherence, which is the complete reverse solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	Seek your fingers, that there be nothing there of the intestines entangled in the white patch or hard
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If however you find anything there: then drive it down to the lower belly
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then grasp the needle, in which there is a thick thread, made of ten threads: and introduce it through the back of the white patch, that is, the tunica which follows the section: and cut off the extremities which protrude from the thread, until there remain four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then make a loop with each over each other in the shape of a cross: and ligate with two threads, of which we have spoken, because it is under the skin of the testicles a ligament which unites them, until it cannot any longer contain any of the things which nourish them: so that it does not happen that after the operation there remains a cold abscess
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And put in again a ligament outside the first ligament, long enough to be less than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures draw out from the white patch, which is under the skin of the testicles, as much as the quantity of the magnitude of a finger: and cut off the rest entirely according to the roundness, and take out from it one.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then dry the lower part of the skin of the testicles of the section from which blood runs, and heal: as we have narrated before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply soaked wool under the bandage in oil, and put in: and administer the ligament which we have narrated.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the white pith has been cauterized, after its incision be watchful of the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Blood flow is prone to occur in this case.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And let go the ligament until it falls away by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If, however, its case is delayed, then it will be bound with warm water: and place above that which we mentioned, until it falls away
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the wound with the rest of the care for wounds, until it heals
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Of a Suppurated Limb.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LXVI.</start_of_turn>
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In a Suppurated Limb let no one presume to treat it with iron
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first they say that it is like that which we have narrated in the Ramus which is with the Bone-Splint.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, as the bone-splint is applied after the section above that with ease: then dry in the middle, and care afterwards with that which opens it up, until the splints fall away: and care for the wound, as we have mentioned, until it heals
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Of the disruption which occurs in the Groins
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LXVII.</start_of_turn
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a Rupture occurs in the Groins, as we have mentioned, and the place is evident, and the intestines do not descend to the testicles for anything: and if they descend, it is little, and returns in every hour: indeed if prolonged for a long time, a fissure is added in the pith, until the intestines descend into the pith
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this occurs from the extension of the pith, which is in the Groins, as we have mentioned
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	When the swelling has been extended, it is softened, and the place is raised up, and it emits.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	Its care is like that with cautery, as it has been said before.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	When it is cured with iron, it is done in this way: the patient lies upon his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry the place of the rupture, raise it up and emit it by cutting across its breadth, according to the quantity of three fingers
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then bind up the swelling and those which are under the skin, until the white swelling, which is under the skin following the said, is detected.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take the radium and place it upon the place where the swelling has emitted from the swelling, and press it deep into the belly
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then take two points from the edge of the swelling from the swelling, and join them with a suture: then draw out the edge of the swelling
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut through the swelling at all, neither pull out hair or anything else, like I have told you in the treatment of intestinal branches.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you have finished cutting the suture, moisten it, and restore the wound, until it is consolidated
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	Let the swelling relax, and do not add to the emission of the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cautery is better in this place: because it is closer to the membrane.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	About the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is softened in many people, because the meats which are between them are softened, and the aspect of it is made worse.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is asking for treatment to make the patient lie upon his back, and to cut through the whole skin which has been softened over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then two lips are to be brought together with sutures: and if desired, the excess of softened skin is to be excised with three or four sutures, and to tighten the suture
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	And then to cut through between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	And then to care for the remaining wounds until they are healed, and the stitches are to be removed
¶ De Castratione.	(The text following this point is not included in the request and is not translated.)
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LXIX
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You know that castration is forbidden in our law: and because of this it is permitted for me not to remind it in this book: and it is not necessary to remind it, except for two cases.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	Of which one is that it is in the science of medicine when it is inquired about: and to know its treatment when it has happened.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other is that we are much in need of castration for some animals, because of our enjoyment of them, such as horses, gazelles, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by cutting off.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by incision, and section
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In which way, however, which is done by attrition, the operation is: that we make the animal sit in warm water, until the testicles soften and relax, and hang down: then cut off their hands, until they are dissolved and do not appear to the touch
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	In castration, however, through incision and section, it is necessary to ligate the animal and grasp the skin of the testicles with the left hand.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And thus is the better method of castration by attrition: for perhaps attrition will leave something behind from the testicles, which the animal desires in coitus.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it has healed.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	Of the care of hermaphrodites, two methods exist
Caput LXX.	(The text continues with further medical instructions.)
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is born from two mothers
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them appears because it follows the space, or in the skin of the testicles, or between two testicles, a figure like a female vulva, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine comes out from that which is in the skin of the testicles
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	But in women there is only one kind, which is the female vulva which is placed over the belly like small testicles and extends outwards: of which one is like the penis of a man, and two like two testicles
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the care of the three kinds, two of which are born from two mothers, and the one from a woman, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh until the impression of them is fled.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then care for the rest of the wounds
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	But as for the second kind of hermaphroditism from which urine comes from the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any care for it whatsoever.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	On the incision of the Tentiginis, and the protruding flesh in the vulvas of women.
Caput LXXI.	On the incision of the Tentiginis, and the protruding flesh in the vulvas of women.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The Tentiginis sometimes adds something beyond its natural size, until it becomes deformed and unsightly: and sometimes it swells in certain women to such an extent that it expands as far as the hips, and persists until coitus.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	It is necessary therefore to remove the superfluous flesh of the Tentiginis, either with one cut or two: and do not hesitate in the incision, especially in the depth of the root: lest there should be a flow of blood
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the healing of the wound, until it is healed
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	But the flesh which is born in the opening of the womb, until it is expelled: and perhaps it goes out to the exterior like the tail: and because of this some call it caudal fistula.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore to incisions as we did the Tentiginis, and to take care of it, until it is healed
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the care of the Alratica, which is the vulva of a woman which is not perforated.
Caput LXXII.	On the care of the Alratica, which is the vulva of a woman which is not perforated
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	The Alratica is, when it is neither perforated nor has a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	It is either natural or accidental
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	It is accidental from an ailment which preceded it: and sometimes it is formed from the native flesh added, or from fine blood vessels, or from fat: and it occurs either in the depth of the womb, or in the flanks, or in the upper part of it, or in the lower part of it: and it prevents coitus and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps prevents menstruation
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	Knowledge of the condition is acquired from the aspect of obstetrics, when the opening appears close at hand.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If it is not apparent, then seek with your fingers, or with the aid of an instrument.</start_of_turn>
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If the opening is from a thin membrane, and is close to the bones, then grasp firmly, and break it.</start_of_turn>
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is necessary to place over two lips two cushions.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your two fingers of both hands together, and the woman should sit with her buttocks spread wide.</start_of_turn
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch out the two lips with force, until the thin membrane is broken and the opening is created.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then grasp wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the place: and the woman should abstain from all food until the place has healed.</start_of_turn
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If the membrane is thick and tough: then it is necessary to cut it with a knife like the edge of a myrtle leaf.</start_of_turn
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If the opening is from natural flesh: then suspend it with hooks, and cut it through: and be with physicians who will cause the flow of blood without causing damage, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus it will be aggregated with albumin or urine.</start_of_turn>
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a wide lead cannula, so that it does not cause the wound to heal too quickly, keep it for a few days: and administer vinegar from dry wine, then care for the rest of the treatment until it heals.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when there is birth in the matrix of other meats: it is necessary to do this in this way: while there is no cancerous tumor in the matrix, do not use iron in any way.</start_of_turn
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	Concerning the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor of the red in the veins of women.
Caput LXXIII.	Concerning the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor of the red in the veins of women.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are indeed the opening of the veins of the rectum, from which blood flows out in large quantities due to excess.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When the hemorrhoids have become large, they cause pain: and as I have already mentioned in the discussion of their kinds, and their signs: here I will tell you what is to be received for their treatment, and what is not
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say, therefore, that hemorrhoids which are in the belly and not visible to the eye: then there is no treatment for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	Those which are in the belly and over which sense falls are those which are cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary therefore that the woman be put into a cold house
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then stretch out Athehelil with forceps, or with rough cloth, and cut away the roots from them
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder over the roots with one of the powders mentioned above, without causing any damage: like acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus, and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then press her feet against the wall for an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then put her down in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the bleeding persists: then make her sit in a decoction of rue, and nutmeg seeds, and barley, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If the bleeding stops with this: good. And if not, make the edges of the wound adhere to each other, and give her milk, without causing any damage
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and soak it in grease of poppy seeds, or in almond oil, or in fat of asses, that is, beeswax, wine of Ponticus, and make it adhere to the wound.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When the swelling has subsided, then care for the place with unguents until it has healed.</start_of_turn>
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	However, it is red like a head of garlic, and has a rough appearance.</start_of_turn>
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore that you cut away what appears from it, as I said a little while ago: and care for it until it has healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Of the perforation of the Exitura which happens in the matrix.</start_of_turn>
Caput LXXIIII.	The head is seventy-four.</start_of_turn
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of swellings happen in the matrix, such as cancer, and stone abscess, and ulcer, and tumor, and carbuncle, and herpes, and aestioma, and fistula, and hemorrhoids, and carbuncles, and gangrene.</start_of_turn
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I will say also that I mentioned all these diseases and their signs and their cures in detail: it is necessary to say in this treatise the carbuncle which happens in the matrix, when it is from swellings which join health, and to know how to open it with a knife.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	You must consider this.</start_of_turn
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	When the pain of the swelling is acute with percussion, flame and fever: and you see it turning red: if it falls over your senses, do not attempt to perforate it: care for it with something that will promote maturation, until the acute pain of the accident has subsided.</start_of_turn
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make her sit upon a seat which beats two seats beneath her, and that she recline or is supported upon her back, and that she gather her feet to the lower part of her belly: and that her knees be spread wide, and that she place her arms under her knees, and that she tie each ligament conveniently to that.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the midwife sit to the right, and manage the instrument with which the opening of the birth passage is made.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose shape comes in the shape of an egg which is behind
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary that when you administer this instrument that the liver is placed with the ribs at the depth of the woman's belly: so that it does not go in deeper than the belly, and does not damage the lower part
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If however the instrument is greater than the depth of the belly, then you must place sponges upon the covering of the depth of the belly: so that the entrance of the whole instrument into the belly is prohibited: and you must place a bandage which runs in the instrument from the upper side: and that you hold the instrument and that you rotate the minister of the bandage until the depth of the belly is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the opening appears, and the hand touches it, and it is soft and gentle: then it is necessary that you cut her near her head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the blood is evacuated, then it is necessary that you put on a compress soaked in warm rose-water: or in green oil, in which there is some astringency: and put on the compress, and draw out the section from the depth of the belly
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And put externally on the belly, and on the flanks a warm wool blanket soaked in water in which there are bubbles.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then he cares for two days with the unguent that agrees with it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	When the matrix and the vulnus have been bathed, it is to be plastered with water and honey: then with water in which the root of lily or long aristolochia has been boiled: then return to the unguent.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the vulnus has been hidden inside the matrix, then it is necessary to keep it away from its cure with iron, or to care for it in the way we have mentioned in the previous instruction
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Concerning the obstetrics of women, how to treat the embryos of the womb, according to the unnatural figure of their emergence.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 72.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the Obstetrician to first learn the natural figure of delivery.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	When women are squeezed in childbirth and desire to smell the air, and groan over what is above them during delivery, and hasten the birth of the embryo: then you know that this delivery is natural, and that the head comes out first, and the second with it, or that it is suspended or hanging from the navel
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When you see these signs, then it is necessary to compress the womb, so that the embryo comes down more quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends over the head, it descends with the second part and comes out with them together with the good delivery
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	Whoever is beyond this delivery is unnatural and harmful
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the fetus comes out over its feet, and its body comes out before the head, and the feet and hands together, or one foot alone: or the head and the hand: or the belly: and perhaps it turns over on its neck, and similar things from the unnatural figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is necessary for the Obstetrician to be prudent, discreet in all these matters, and to beware of error and neglect: for I shall demonstrate every figure from these [instruments], and how each is designed, and it will be understood thereby, and I shall stand above it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges over its head during its natural expulsion, and the latter is difficult for the woman, and its virtue is impaired: then let her sit down, or let the women hold her: and let steam rise from her moisture with vinegar and decocted henbane, and with oily substances.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the Obstetrician inserts his fingers between the [vaginal] lips of the Sponge, and finds the second one, and severs it with his nail, until it runs out from the moisture: and he grasps the woman's belly, until the fetus descends
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not descend, then it is necessary to instill the woman with [a solution of] vinegar from henbane, with slippery elm.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then command her to lie down after instilling, so as to compress: and let her breathe steadily for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	The fetus will immediately come out.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus emerge at once, it is necessary to reduce them gradually with ease
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If it does not obey in the delivery, then let the woman sit down and elevate her feet above the ground: then press the seat down to the earth: and the woman should be held so that she does not fall from the concussion
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then cut through the ease and extract the fetus: and tie up the hand with a cloth, and extract it with evenness: for it will come out itself.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The fetus has emerged from its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus emerges from its feet, then it is necessary to urge it upwards: afterwards, gradually convert the fetus: finally, equalize it itself.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then grasp one of its feet and extend it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When it has emerged as far as the thighs, then command it to lie down, so that it will compress and rest: it will then go out, God willing.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	If it does not come out as we have described, then gradually reduce the fetus until you have set it according to its natural shape
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For indeed it will go out of itself then
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is obstructed as we have described: then take from the high slime, and blood clots, and gum dissolved in water: and pierce all through in the belly with a good blow: then join with the woman's urine and the lower part of her belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water, until the afterbirth follows naturally.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When the lower parts are softened by the heat, then give her a sieve of myrrh: and support her
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When she has held the sieve for an hour, then make her sit on a seat
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then command her to sneeze: and strain her jaw and nose: and compress the lower part of her belly gently
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fetus will go out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The fetus has emerged from its knees and hands
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it appears in this form, then it will gradually withdraw its hands inwards.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman lies upon her shoulder, and her feet hang down below: she lies upon the bed, and she covers her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then she slowly raises her belly upwards
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then pull out what is under her feet from the shoes, until it is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not come out, then grasp her feet and move them up and down
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then slowly press what is above the navel upwards, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then put in your hands, and gently support the fetus: and command the woman to press, until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The fetus comes out hanging laterally from the hands
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	It is completed in the reduction of her hand
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	But if it is not possible to reduce the hand, then raise up the woman, and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If she is unable to walk, then make her lie on the bed: and strike her thighs with a blow which is enough to cause her to groan
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the liniment which you prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she gives birth, then make her sit on a seat
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then watch in the reduction of the hand, and equal the fetus according to its natural figure: and command the woman to breathe steadily, and tell her to press, until it comes out
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The fetus comes out on her shoulder, with her hands spread out, and her face is towards the mother's back
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The obstetrix must hold the hand of the fetus firmly, then gradually release it, and equalize it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is equal, then place above its belly what we have mentioned from wax and mucus
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then command it to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done this, then make it sit on its seat, and command it to incline to the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then command it to press: and make it exhale with a cough.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The fetus is prepared for birth on the right side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the opening of the womb in this manner with the second [finger], then tear the second [finger] with your thumb, until it is evacuated from the moisture
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If it is suspended on the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it does not remain and does not die
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus inwards, until you have placed it according to what is required: and command the woman to press slightly: for it will go out through the easy birth opening itself.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	Birth of twins, or many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You know that twins are often born together: and sometimes three or four are born together.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, this is an unusual thing, and is rarely found.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five or more is beyond nature, and does not endure: and continues with them, although multiplied, the second one being joined to one: and they are separated by the navel of each of them
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they come out like a single fetus through the natural birth opening, easily: and sometimes they come out through an unnatural opening, as we have narrated.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some things are difficult at the part, and they reach that which we mentioned from unnatural figures, then care for them as we have said: and let the obstretrix be slight, and let her do what she does with ease and tardiness, and she shall adapt herself to every figure as she is prepared from the ingenuity leading to safety.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remember that which is formed in the womb from embryos, and which abort.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	When one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more than ten are formed in the womb: and I have seen it verified that a woman has aborted seven, and another fifteen, all of whom were formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which is done by the measurement of the glorious sage.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore all this pertains to the science of Obstetrics
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps therefore it will reach that which is like this: oppose to it what pertains to it
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	Of the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you care for a dead fetus with that which I said in the discourse from the medicine, and it does not go out, and you must do what you will with your hands, then you must consider it
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If a woman is of sound virtue and is not with any of the things from which she is afraid to lose her life during childbirth: then it must be that she rests on her seat, on her back, and let her head be inclined downwards, and her legs be elevated: and the minister shall keep hold of her from two parts, or she shall be bound to the bed, so that her body is not pulled out during the extraction of the fetus
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the os matrice with oils which are humid with mucilage of high rank, and fennel, and linseed seed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then let the Obstetrix put his hand into the matrix with ease after having moistened it with these oils and mucilages.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then he seeks the place where the ribs are joined to the fetus, and the convenient place for it
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider now therefore, if the fetus is ready to descend upon his head: then fix the ribs to his eyes, or to his neck, or to his mouth, or to his palate, or under his beard, or under his armpits, or in the adjacent parts of the ribs, and under the hypopomus
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If, however, the descent is upon his feet, then in the loin, and in the middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that he grasp the rib with his right hand: and let his curvature rest in that which is between the left thumb and the little finger: and he introduces it with the hand with ease, and fixes the rib in one of those places which we mentioned until it comes to a halt
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then he fixes the other rib, or the third if necessary: so that there is an equal tension, and it does not incline to one side
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then extend with an equal extension, and do not be extended only in a straight line, but move towards all parts, so as to alleviate its exit: as it is done with a tooth when it is extracted.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary between these to soften the extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	Which if it is retained from this side, then let the Obstetrix grasp any digit with oil, and introduce it from the side, so as to rotate with it what is retained
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore the limb of the fetus comes out, then change the nails to another place which is higher: do this until the fetus comes out entirely
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If the hand has gone beyond another, and it is not possible to restore it, because of its compression: then it is necessary to cover over the wound.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then withdraw the hand until it has gone beyond all the way, cut the palm of the hand or at the base of the plant, or at the elbow: and thus it is necessary that you make in the hand the other way around, and in two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If however the head of the fetus is large, or if there is compression for him in the birth, or there is water in his head: then it is necessary that he introduce between the fingers the Spatumile spinosum, and find it with the head, and extract the water: or break it with the instrument which is called Almisdac: whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which follows.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Likewise do as concerning a fetus of great head-size; then it is necessary that you cut through the membrane. Or extract him with the hook, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then draw out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	When the head has gone out, and is compressed at the rib: then it is found, until the moisture which is in the chest is drained out
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	When however it does not complicate, neither does it obey the going out: then cut off the head roughly, as much as is possible for you
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	When however the lower belly is apostematized, or there is water in it: then it is necessary that you perforate it, until the moisture is run out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	When however the fetus is above his feet: then the traction of him is easy, and the direction of him towards the maternal bone is gentle
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	When however it is compressed at the belly, or the chest: then it is necessary that you extract it with the cloth which you have covered over your hand: and find the belly, or the chest, until it is run out of it.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If, however, the other limbs are removed and the head remains: then the Obstetrix inserts his left hand into the head.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If the mouth of the uterus is open: then he inserts his hand into the depth of the uterus, and grasps the head, and pulls it towards the os of the uterus: then he inserts into it one or two fingers and pulls them with it.</start_of_turn>
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the os of the uterus is closed, because of a thick clot which has occurred to it: then it is not necessary to work above it, indeed it is necessary at that time to administer an effusion of liquid things, fats: and administer plasters: and sit in water which softens and moistens.</start_of_turn>
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is above its side: then it is possible to equalize it: then is administered what we said concerning the fetus above.</start_of_turn>
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If that is not possible, then it is done hastily, and it is extracted.</start_of_turn>
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not let anything fall out of the second part entirely.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then administer what we said concerning the clots which occur in the uterus.</start_of_turn
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If blood flows: then descends into styptic waters, and administer the rest of the treatment.</start_of_turn
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself have seen a woman in whose womb a fetus was dead: then she was impregnated above her with another, afterwards another fetus was also dead.</start_of_turn
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	It happened to her afterwards a long time, a clot in her navel, which was inflated, until it opened: and it began to emit pus.</start_of_turn
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I am called to his care, and I have treated him for a long time: and the wound is not consolidated.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I place above it some strong adhesive plaster: and it has come out of its place.</start_of_turn>
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then some days passed by, and it came out of its place again.</start_of_turn
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I am sore there, because there is no bone in it.</start_of_turn>
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I think therefore that there were dead bones of a fetus.</start_of_turn>
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I asked about the wound, and I extracted many bones, the woman being in better conditions: and I have treated it thus for a long time, and it is now leaving pus a little.</start_of_turn
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not consolidate this foreign body, except that there is science in it, and an aid to that which the artificer doctor administers with his hand in treatment.</start_of_turn>
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	Regarding the forms of the necessary instruments for extracting a fetus.</start_of_turn
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.</start_of_turn>
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the form of the Strictor, with which books are equalised, having two rings in two extremities of two sticks.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	But it must be known that this hook should be finer than the strictor: and that it should be made either of ebony or of seasoned wood.</start_of_turn
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of every stick is like two fingers: and the margin of each of them is like one finger, and the length of each of them is palm and a half: and in the middle of the two sticks are two additaments of the same kind of wood, which are firm in both, of whose length is half a palm and a little, and the width of each is like two fingers, or less.</start_of_turn
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	Two additional things are introduced into the matrix of the bone, so that it opens when you rotate two Vertigines.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of the Vertigines which opens the matrix.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form like that, finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	It is made from the wood of the bone, or from ivory, according to the shape of pincers.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	Indeed, at its extremity these two things are introduced, as mentioned above: and the length of each of these things from the tip is like a palm, and the breadth of each is like two fingers
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When you wish to open the matrix with these, then make her sit on a chair, with her feet hanging over the edge, and open what is between her buttocks
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce these two things together into the matrix: and you hold the lower extremity of the instrument between her thighs
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, like you do with pincers, equally according to the quantity that you wish to open the mouth of the matrix, until the Obstetrician wishes to stop
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The other form of the Vertigines which they said was like the Impelling Force which drives out the fetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of the Almidach, which counteracts the large head: and it is assimilated to the forceps, which have teeth at the extremity, like these two things.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it is hooked, like the forceps following this form, like these two things, which have teeth like saw-teeth, with which it incides and counteracts
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of the Almidach which counteracts the small head
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The shape of the neighbour who has one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of the neighbor having spines two.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of the forceps which has teeth serrated, with which the head of the fetus is held.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of the spatula having two extremities to bind the head
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two spatulas also of the hands
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	These instruments are all used, and the more numerous their species, and the more they are prepared by the artificer, the more rapid is the operation and the greater is the benefit to men, on account of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	It does not behove you to despise any of these instruments, because they are prepared for you
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	Necessity compels them indeed
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	About the extraction of the second one
Caput LXXVIII.	Head seventy-eighth
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second one is retained at birth, then it is necessary to remove the lower ones, so that it may retain its breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make a grasp with your thumb on its bone, and grasp its nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If it comes out through this, it is good
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then grasp the head and perforate through the skull: and put in it herbs that will open the bone of the matrix, such as calamine, rue, and alum, chamomile, and saffron, and balsam, and cedar: grasp all of these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them with water, and put them over fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then put a bundle of reeds over the hole of the skull, and the other extremity in the bone of the matrix: and hold it until the vapor has reached the cavity of the matrix
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make the incision as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	The incision shall proceed easily from that point forward.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If, however, after this treatment, it still fails to proceed: then command the Obstetrician to immerse his hand in the navel-fat or in the thick mucus of the belly
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then insert the instrument into the wound and explore with it alongside the second incision
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When you have found it, then grasp it and gradually expand it
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If, however, it is an appendix that lies deep in the belly: then insert the hand once more, as we have said, until you have reached the second incision. Then slowly withdraw the hand, following the natural direction, so as not to tear the matrix at the point of traction. It is better, however, to move the appendix to the right and left sides: then add some traction as well
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	The wound itself will now obey and be cured, and will depart from its adherence.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the matrix is closed, as we have said: care for the wound with closure, and from an ointment jar with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If it still does not depart after all that we have said: then beware lest you tire yourself out in the process of its extraction
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	It is true that it must come out at the os of the matrix to the woman's hip
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then bandage the wound with unguent tetrapharmacon
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	The wound itself will become rotten after a few days, and will then dissolve and depart
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	Indeed when it has become rotten, it will emit a bad odor from the stomach and head, and this will cause sickness.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	It is necessary therefore that suitable fumigations be administered for that.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancients are experts in fumigation with naphtha and powdered alum.</start_of_turn>
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The mode of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated for the retention of the second [menstrual] flow.</start_of_turn>
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be like an outpouring of milk, or from a horn: and the outer end shall be spread over the fire: and the fumigation shall be placed over the berries: let it remain there until the said fumigation has been consumed; and do it again.</start_of_turn
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Concerning the care of an unpierced animal.</start_of_turn
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LXXIX.</start_of_turn>
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born with their navels unpierced, whom I have seen to be nourished by fine oil.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	It is necessary therefore that the midwife pierce that [navel] with her finger: and if not, pierce it with a fine needle: and beware of tears, lest it touch him.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place upon it wool soaked in wine and oil.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with nails until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If indeed it is to be done, then put in the hole a lead cannula for many days, and remove it when the boy wishes to go.</start_of_turn
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And it sometimes happens that the navel of an animal is pierced from the consolidation of the wound, or from the afterbirth.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is necessary therefore that you dry that consolidation, and then care for it as we said before concerning care and lead.</start_of_turn
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Concerning the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Concerning the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower part are of two kinds: Nodulation and Swelling which occur close to any bone, or in the space of one part: and are one fistula, or more.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When the nodule has been thus removed, it is opened, and white watery moisture or subtle pus runs out from it
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore they are recognized as penetrating by that which comes out with the evacuation, and by swelling, when the patient evacuates: and perhaps comes out through a worm.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are fistulas when they are penetrating from the space until the bone, and until the marrow of the bone.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are penetrating from the space until the hip joint, and until the node of the buttocks
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From this, however, it is known that a penetrating fistula until a bone, even if not penetrating, is, as it were, that you insert your finger into the bone: and you insert a needle subtile into the fistula from the air, or from iron: when there is no curvature (of the bone).
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	When there is curvature in it, then insert into the bone a fine lead needle, or a hair from a horse's tail, until you feel the needle, or the hair in your finger
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	When you do not feel it penetrate, neither from a wound, nor from evacuation, nor swelling, nor a worm as I have said: then you know that it is not penetrating: do therefore the treatment correctly
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating until the marrow, or until the bladder: then the significance of it is the discharge of urine from it, and the prohibition of this from happening again until it has healed with the physicians.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If it has penetrated as far as the hip joint, or even to the bones of the hip: then its sign is that it proceeds until there, if there is no twist of the organ until the bones: and there is pain surrounding the part, and pus always comes out from it; and no medicine is useful for it, neither is it consolidated with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	In all these penetrating wounds there is no complete cure: the cure for them is toil and perseverance, from the fools of doctors, on whom they are formed.</start_of_turn>
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in those which are neither penetrating nor old, hope of healing is expected with support: as I have said before, and as I have proved: that is, let the patient lie between your hands on his back: and lift his legs up to above his hips, and let his hips be inclined towards his belly.</start_of_turn>
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce lead or air, if there is a twist in the fistula, until you know where the tentacle ends.</start_of_turn>
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If, however, the patient feels around the limb something, then it is necessary to introduce your finger as a sign into the limb.</start_of_turn
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If you feel in your finger the tentacle which you have detected is penetrating, besides that which you feel between your finger and the flesh, or between the flesh and bone: then you know certainly that it is penetrating: no labour is to be done in it, because its cure is not that.</start_of_turn>
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They say that in some men the cure is in the flesh itself, and in the medicine which is expected to be of benefit, that is, to make a slight cautery according to the size of the fistula, as has been said before, and to introduce the flame into the fistula until it reaches around the limb.</start_of_turn
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then do it again twice or thrice until you know that all the added flesh, which is like the pennae of birds, has become soft.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then keep it bound with butter until the flesh has gone; then do it with unguents which generate flesh and consolidate it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If it is healed, that is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	If not, it will not be healed by any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	If it comes out, and does not mend until it reaches your thumb which is in the year, and is between the thumb and the great toe, and there is a thick layer of flesh between them, and blood: then make an opening in that which follows the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the opening, and you dry with the thumb which is in the fistula until it comes away from the cutting edge, and the thumb is freed and falls off
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then soften those soft flesh which have become like the pennae of birds, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If however blood boils between you and the operation, and dissolves between you and the operation as you cut: then it is better to cauterize with fire or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For the cauterizing with fire brings together the good qualities, brings about the softening of the added flesh and the cutting off of blood, and dries out humours.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then keep it bound with butter or poultices until pus comes out, and the soft flesh becomes pus
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then do it with strong unguents which consolidate and generate flesh: and these are medicines which have stypticity and drying power
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	When restoration is complete, then healing has occurred: and not through repeated attempts.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	When, however, the fistula persists to the depth of the rectum, and is prolonged by the excess of the body: then insert your finger into the rectum and inquire about it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If, however, you feel resistance, and between you and the rectum there is either fat or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation in that place, except according to the measure of trust and hope
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	For in that case one must employ three measures: either one cauterizes the same [fistula], as we have said: or one severs the vein, until you have obtained a flattening of it, so that it is possible for you to insert instruments, and to heal from the next time
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed too much with the section, lest you cut through the mucous membrane of the rectum, and thereby cause an excessive discharge of blood without your consent.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for it as we have said
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will heal by itself: or you will lengthen the vein, and dry it up after you have softened it, as we have said, or with the finger, or with an acute instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then soften the surrounding flesh which is in the section, until it becomes soft as with the mark of a scratch
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then try to restore the whole wound with the section, and the upper orifice where consolidation has taken place: and the fistula will remain open in the inner part of the rectum, and will be easier over the infirmity.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And when you suture the fistula in this way: that is, when you insert your finger into the fistula: and it is on the side of the rectum around the surface of the body with skin and the margin of the rectum: then grasp the tip of the instrument which is like a needle, that is, one that pierces the skin, according to this shape.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And introduce within the loop of the entangled thread from five threads, and surround them.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	And introduce the needle with the thread through the hole, until the hole follows the curve of the loop
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If there is a perforation on the inner margin of the anus near the base, then withdraw the thread from that hole: so that you can introduce your finger into the anus and withdraw the end of the thread, and bring together both ends: and tighten both of them, and let go of it on one day, or two days: and the more the thread has entered the flesh, tighten it well, until those parts of the flesh which are between the two ends of the thread have fallen away: then care for the wound until it has healed, and it will be restored.</start_of_turn>
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If, however, the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in whatever way you prepare it, except if it is very deep.</start_of_turn
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	You must not make it penetrate because of the tear, so that you do not damage it.</start_of_turn
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do as we have said, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	Make a sponge of the kind which is found in the fistula, whose curvature is acute above and blunt below, so that it does not tear that which is not necessary, like urine.</start_of_turn
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	On the stitching of hemorrhoids, from which blood runs from the incision of them: and care for the incisions.</start_of_turn
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter 8.</start_of_turn>
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids of two kinds.</start_of_turn
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Some are within the anus, like the stones of a carob or of a plum: or as if they were like the seeds of a walnut.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	There are both small and large ones among them: and blood always flows from them, and it is one, and there are many of them.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the body, and at their extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	But those that are outside the body are mostly small and moist, from which flows clear urine or a little blood slowly: and they are according to the colour of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of the one inside the body is to apply pressure to the patient: and to express it out until the anus is evacuated, and to show that the pain has gone away
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, do so also with the hands: or hold them with your finger
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	And then strike them at the roots of their hairs.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If, however, they do not remain in the wound because of the moisture of the wound and their softness: then cover them with rough cloth, or with a bandage of felt, and pull them out with your fingers
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	And then strike them, and powder over them after cutting whatever powder you wish, so that they remain in the place of the cautery
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what has been said in the chapter on cautery.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	And then care for the wound until it heals.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	And if the anus does not evacuate, then administer to the patient a cathartic in which there is a slight biting, so that it may be evacuated quickly when the patient expels it.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If, however, they are outside the anus, then the matter is easy: and it is as though you were grasping them with your finger, or grasping them with a forceps, and cutting them off
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for them as we have said until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	He who shuns incision with the knife must now administer the suture according to this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take the twisted thread and introduce it into the point.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw out the thread to the upper part and make it penetrate with the needle at its root from the opposite side: and pass through two ends of the thread, at the lower part of the needle, and make them lateral: and tighten the thread strongly.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then knot the thread and draw out the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the stitches and let go of one: neither keep it too tight, lest there be excessive bleeding from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place upon each wound a soaked compress of infused oil in rose water, or butter, and place it upon the wound: and command the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let it go until it falls off naturally
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the stitches have fallen out, care for them with unguents and remain attentive until they are healed
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	(The text continues with instructions on wound care.)
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	Many times these arise from excessive evacuation of stool, and constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When these things are wanting, and no medicine will avail: then it is necessary to mark with the point of Spatumilis, or with your finger, until they become moist, and remove from the wound the upper layer which hinders adhesion.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then care for them until they are consolidated as seems necessary
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If, however, they do not consolidate: then repeat the process of cleaning with greater force than before, until they bleed much, and are afterwards cared for until they are healed
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	On the treatment of wounds of the limbs, and not of the limbs: and Athlete’s foot, and Warts.
Caput LXXXII.	Concerning the treatment of wounds of the limbs, not of the limbs: and Athlete’s foot, and Warts.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You know that Almirmar is not other than a round node according to the colour of the body, like the head of a nail: and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and the toes: and it happens from a wound at the time of walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	It is necessary therefore that you cut away what is around the nail, and hold it with forceps, or with a needle, and extirpate it from its root
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then care for it: and if you wish, cauterize it according to what has preceded in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	As for Athlete’s foot, it is one small, rough, filtered, round elevation above the surface of the body
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And it often happens in the hands of children
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is to extend the Athlete’s foot and cut it: or to tie it with a silk thread: or with hair, until it falls off
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said with fire, or with acute medicine: and thus you will extirpate the inward Athlete’s foot, and not the outward with an instrument which I will tell you of
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	And as for Warts, it is also a small, filtered elevation, large, above the surface of the body, spreading in depth and breadth: and when it appears in cold weather, it feels like the bite of a worm in it, and it occurs throughout the body: and most of them happen in the hands
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is to take a needle from the beak of an ostrich, or a strong hair: and put it on the Wart, until it contains the circle of the needle from its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then withdraw your hand with the cannula until you reach the circumference of the maggot: and place it in the depth of the flesh, and extract the maggot from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	Or if you wish, do this with an air cannula or a metallic one, according to this form
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper part of the cannula reach the underside of the thumb which is drawn tight, so that it alleviates the tension of the thumb itself and its retraction
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	Or if you wish, burn the maggot according to what is prescribed in the chapter on cautery of Athelius.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	As for the forms of the instruments which are administered to the clister in wounds of animals, and the solution of the belly, and the colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	When the clister is made of silver, or gold, or of blown glass, or hammered metal.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And when they are made of these instruments, small and large, according to those in which they are administered
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	This is done in the care of young children with inflamed lungs, and those which are weak or painful, thus also the clisters of them
Clistere magnum.	A large clister
Cistere paruum.	A small clister
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The cannula, that is, the upper part which is tied to the uterus, should be wide according to this measure: and it should have a distinction so that it is tied to the uterus like water, and its lower part which goes into the belly should be closed, soft, flexible, drawn to thinness: and on one of its sides there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	The breadth of the opening should be as great as the length of the rays, and less so, and the depth in which the medicines are placed is from the belly of the beast: or from parchment of birds, which is according to the shape of the asofrat of the sparrow: whose root is a single palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	The opening is pierced with many holes as it turns, and the space between every hole is the width of a finger
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into the holes a strong thread from raw thread, which is from ten threads, or thereabouts, and join the two ends together as for an asofrat.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When it is placed in this depth, it is sutured at the head of the wound between two marks of constriction strong enough
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	And then close with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	This is the shape of the circle here described, and of the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of the stitching with this is: to grasp both, or the belly from the medicine which is warmed according to the degree of the patient's tolerance: and beware that it is neither too hot nor too cold, nor too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient is laid upon his back, and lifts his legs upwards: and place under this the intestines, that is, the skin over which men or linen rests
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then bind the extremities of the sutures with fat, or with alum, or with barley flour, or like these.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce the instrument into the abdomen with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then take hold of the belly with both hands and press it out until it ejects all that is in the suture into the intestines
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the suture, and lift the patient's legs to the side
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the physician considers him to be leaving, then he shall retain as much as he can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	If he sleeps throughout the night, it is the last resource in his care
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If, however, you bathe him in the bowels of the solution of the belly, and he is hastening his departure: then repeat the enema until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the rectum, then let the enema be gentle and soft, from enemas which children receive
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of the gentle enema over which the skin is tight
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the treatment of wounds of the head without fracture of the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter 84.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have said in the discourse about the treatment of wounds that it agrees with the book, and I shall say here the treatment of them with the hand and with the doctor according to the complement.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say therefore, that wounds are diversified according to that from which they arise, and according to the place where the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The wounds which are made by many things are like the blows of a stone: or the cutting of a sword or knife: or the percussion with a lance, or wood, or arrow: and the like of these from many things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds, however, which arise from the place of the body, such as a wound which falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the genitals: and the like of these from the limbs.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am speaking of the treatment of some wounds, so that I may set out the reasoning and rule concerning the rest of the wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I shall commence with simple head wounds: for the recollection of complex matters will arise at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	Indeed I say.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple head wound occurs, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from a piece of stone, or like it, and if it has merely broken the skin: and it is a great wound, and the time of a severe infection has passed: then take care of it immediately, and perform a cephalic bleed: do not delay this. And extract from him from the blood according to the quantity of his virtue: if there is nothing that prohibits it, especially if there is little blood issuing from the wound
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the bleed be from the opposite side of the wound
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the patient be warned against repletion, and wine, and coarse food.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If anything prohibits the reduction [of the wound], then reduce from food, and do not approach meat, nor drink wine
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And apply upon the wound if it happens to him a soft swelling, a bandage soaked in warm oil, or with wine in which there is styptic.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If you are secure from the swelling, then apply upon the wound, if it is joined with its blood, and has not changed its air, the powder which I will tell you of later: and if it has changed its air, then apply upon it some unguent until it is healed
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If the wound is great, or is from the incision of a knife, and the like: and the edges of it do not adhere by stitches, then adhere them together with sutures, according to what I shall tell you of in the inner wounds about sutures.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If, however, a vein is found to be protruding, hanging loose, and its retention is not possible, except in a small suspension: then cut it off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Care for the vein with the physicians, and restore in it solid flesh in the place of the skin, and command the patient to nourish himself with food in which there is hardness, such as heads and cooked wheat, until the pulse returns: and so be similar.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find in the flesh putrefaction, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut off the putrefied part altogether, and throw it away: then care for the remainder
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If, however, in his veins there is an artery, or a vein from which blood flows: and it is not severed by the physicians, then inquire concerning the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If, therefore, you find it not severed, cut it off with Spatumili, or ligate it.</start_of_turn>
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity compels you when it does not conform to what we have said, then cauterize the vein, until the blood is severed.</start_of_turn>
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If, however, these wounds are small and simple, then the matter is easy and light: so that they are powdered over this powder: because they will consolidate before they change from air.</start_of_turn
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The manner of the powder of the incarnate.</start_of_turn>
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Recipe of olive oil one part, and dragon's blood two parts, and unburnt lime three parts: mix them all together, and grind them: and apply it to the wound, and bind it firmly, until it adheres well to it, and coagulates with the blood.</start_of_turn
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it up again with wool, and send it away, and do not wash it until it has dried, so that it does not become softened.</start_of_turn
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	The medicine is not erased by it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	When only lime remains of the plaster, when there is neither ointment nor dragon's blood in the present case, it also performs the same operation in many great wounds, when it is necessary to lay upon them and bind them, and when there are fresh wounds with their own blood, which have not altered the air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	When it has altered the air somewhat, particularly when it is in summer, its intention is not in this powder. Care for it as we have said, so that you lay upon it some oily unguent or put upon it balls of ground barley made with water and honey, until pus comes out
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the rest with the proper treatment until it is healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If indeed it happens with a fractured bone which is small, then extract it with Gesti: and I will tell you about the treatment of head fractures in this matter.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Of wounds of the head.
Caput LXXXV.	Head wound
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If indeed a wound happens in the head, then there is no difference between it and a wound of the head when it is simple
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If indeed a nerve or artery is cut: in this case if it is a nerve, it is not in vain, except that it must be treated with something which causes clotting, such as sponges, cautery, saffron, and things of that kind
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	For the nerves are known to go away and be contraacted
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	You must not put anything cold on the wound at all: for the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuity is with the brain, which is the soul of the limbs: and let this be treated with gentle medicine, such as powdered lime with a little sweet water infused with oil or with rose oil, and honey, when it washes away even with sweet water: and the rest of the mineral stones, in this way, and oily unguents.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If, however, a wound is large, then administer a suture: or bind up its lips with wool.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If, however, the wound is depth, or it has happened in a sinus in its lower part, in which pus is gathered, then perforate it in a depressed place in that place.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	That if blood flows from the wound due to an artery having been cut: then separate it, or dry it up, and bind it: or cauterize it, if need be for that
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If, however, fragments of cartilage of the gutturis, or all of them, and the mucous membranes are torn: then gather together the lips of the skin with a suture over the neck of the gutturis, and do not touch the guttur, but rather equalize it, and reduce it over its natural form.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it tightly with a bandage, and release it in a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with unguents in which there is stypticity and drying, until it heals
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If, however, a wound has made an imprint in the bone, then uncover it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, remove them all, or whatever can be taken out: and what cannot be prepared, leave it, until the wound has healed, and the bone has separated and its egressio has been expelled.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	That if the wound had been recent, then grind over it powdered gypsum which I have mentioned before
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If, however, it is seen in the wound a bone, and a fistula has formed: then care for it with that concerning which memory comes to you in its chapter
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	(The text continues with further medical instructions.)
Caput LXXXVI.	Head Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a perforation by a lance or a knife, and the blood vessels are deep, then consider them.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If blood flows from the wound when the patient sighs, you know that the wound is deadly
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep and the blood flows with its own blood: do not put in it powder at first, neither bind it up, lest the blood remain in its depth and be fatal. Put in it a strong dressing and leave it for two days.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If there is no dressing in the wound, put in it a thick wool pad at the opening of the wound, so that it absorbs what flows out from the moisture: and make the patient sleep on the wound so that it heals what is gathered in it
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If more than three days or more have passed since the wound and the patient has neither spasm nor bad pulse nor bad breathing, nor any other symptoms, then you know that the wound is healed
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Care for it and with attention, and with medicines, until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If indeed its healing is excused, and it always opens, then you know that a fistula has been formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Care for it from its head chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from the incision of a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then care for it as for one that has been sutured, if it is large: or with powder if it is small
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If however it has made an imprint in the bone, and has burst from it: then inquire about the wound and proceed to extract the fragment, if they are separated
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If they are not separated, then release them, until the bone softens, and the pain will subside naturally.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The treatment of the remaining wounds in the other parts of the body is the judgement of the practitioner in the care of them.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Of wounds of the belly and the intestines, and of their evacuation.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.</start_of_turn>
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The rupture which happens inside is great, medium, or small.</start_of_turn>
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From the great one, indeed, whenever the intestine or intestines come out.</start_of_turn
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	For this reason the introduction of the intestines is more difficult, and more painful.</start_of_turn
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And the small rupture is also difficult because of another way.</start_of_turn
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, if you do not take proper care in the introduction of the intestines to their place immediately, because it swells, opens, and thickens, it becomes difficult for them to enter.</start_of_turn
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, the medium rupture is better than the great one: because in the medium one the reduction of the intestines is not difficult, as it is in the two previous ones.</start_of_turn
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	You know that the suture of the intestines is done in four ways.</start_of_turn
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two sutures are common for the suture of the belly, and for the suture of the remaining wounds of the body: and two other sutures are done in a different way for the remaining wounds.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, there are other methods which are proper for the suture of the intestines: and I shall tell you of one and of another with their exposition and their declaration.</start_of_turn
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	Therefore I say, when a wound is small and something escapes from the intestine through it, making it difficult to reduce it: then that is due to one of two causes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we have said: or because of an inflation in the intestine caused by the cold of the air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When it is thus, then it is necessary to heat it, so as to absorb the sponge or moisten the bandage in warm water alone
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil in water a little barley, and some pepper and salt, and embrace with these the intestine, until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When it makes a sticky liquid: better than plain water for resolving the inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When the inflation has been resolved, then moisten the intestine with the warm water in which it has been boiled, or with oil.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For thus it will soothe the entrance of it with a little thing.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If indeed it is excused after this treatment, then find in the disruption a small opening, with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	The first treatment is better when prepared than a section: and it does not make the wound necessary to cut after the need and the defect of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part be solid, acute, and the other part not acute: and the extremity should not be with the smoothness of butter, but rather more blunt: and that is like a chickpea, as in liquid
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When the wound is thus enlarged, and the intestine enters, then it is necessary to reduce it according to its natural form in its own place, if possible over that: because that is better
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When the disruption is wide in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary that you make the patient lie on his back and raise his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	If it is in the upper part of the belly: then place his head and raise his chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	Likewise, if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the belly: then put your intention and your attention always in this, that the part which has the wound should be higher than the other part
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it is necessary that you do this in large wounds and in medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, put this according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make sure that there is a reliable presence between your hands, who will hold the whole disruption with his hand: and join his lips together.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then take from this something that follows the suture something: and this is the common method of stitching one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is necessary that you take needles, or the number of needles according to the quantity of the wound's breadth
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then withdraw from the extremity of the disruption the quantity of a finger of the hand, i.e. the doctor: and fix the needle once you have introduced it into the thread in two extremities of the skin, with two extremities of fat which is under the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from another side, and when you have gathered together two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of fat: and there are four orders
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then string with a double thread around the circumference of the needle several times from two parts simultaneously, until two lips of the wound are gathered together by convergence of a tenth part.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let go of the length of the finger also, and fix in place an edge of the skin: afterwards draw back the skin with a thread, as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Do not cease to make it until you have completed the ligation of the whole wound
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let there be needles of medium size between the length and the thickness: because the fine needles easily slip through the flesh: and the thick ones are difficult to pass through the skin: for this reason it is necessary that they be of medium size in thickness, and of length.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed at the two closest edges of the skin: so that the flesh is not easily pierced, and that the wound does not open before its consolidation, and that it does not lengthen even with the suture, so that it does not hinder the consolidation of the wound
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then prick the extremity of the needle, so that it does not damage the patient in his sleep: and place over the skin small beads from wool from all sides, which hold the extremities of the needles: and let go of them when you know that the wound has consolidated
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And thus this is a kind of suture which is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For it suffices in the suture of these wounds with one needle, or two, or a few.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second suture is common, that is, that you bring together four extremities: two of the skin and two of the fat, with a needle in which the thread is equally thick and thin.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have pierced with the needle the four extremities, reduce the needle from the part where you began, so that the thread which is left is withdrawn from the upper part of the wound: so that there is a suture, as when you string up cloth with a needle, and put between every suture the quantity of the length of the smaller finger
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	Men know this stitch.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	When such a stitch is made, men know that a wound has occurred in the belly which has been caused by a knife, and that there is a rupture of the wound more than half its extent: and that there has escaped from the intestines about two palms from the middle of the intestine, and that there is a rupture in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	So it was reduced after the intestine had been held outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	It was consolidated in that space for about fifteen days: and I cared for it, and it healed: and it went on living for many years afterwards, living in its accustomed place.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians judged that it would not heal.</start_of_turn>
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it happened by a miracle that I did not treat it with unguent.</start_of_turn
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where unguent was not to be found, neither did I have any of the physicians.</start_of_turn>
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I placed above the wound a cushion of wool twice a day, and I took care of its washing with sweet water until it healed.</start_of_turn>
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	And two other kinds of stitches I call my own according to the narration of the sermon.</start_of_turn
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is that you begin with a sharp stitch: and you bring the point from the exterior to the interior part.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When you have thus penetrated the skin and in the lacteal cavity you have reached the endpoint of the euntem, according to the length and breadth of the whole body: withdraw the extremity of the needle in the side in which you introduced the point, and make the needle penetrate from the inside outwards in the opposite extremity.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have finished penetrating from the exterior to the interior, then penetrate once more in the same extremity from the outside to the inside: and draw out the extremity which is on this side, which is on this side of the palm, and penetrate the thumb from the inside to the outside: and penetrate with the same penetration as you made when you penetrated the extremity of the palm, until it penetrates the whole of it.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then also begin from this same side and draw out the extremity which is from the palm on the other side, and draw out the thumb from the skin where it penetrated
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then reduce the wound to the skin and draw out the extremity of the palm with this extremity: and draw out the thumb from the skin which is on that side, and make it one with this, and the other: and make this one after the other, until you have closed the wound throughout according to this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of all these sutures is like the sutures of the skin which join the skins: so that you draw out one side from one part of the extremity and draw out the other side from the other part, until you have completed it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of suture which Gale has said is like this.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This is the way in which he has said it, namely, that you must do as certain physicians do with certain things, that is to say, unite all the parts to the same extent as is convenient by nature: and applying the extremity of the palm to its other extremity, and the thumb to the other extremity of the palm.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this is done according to what I have said.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary to bring the thumb close to the palm from the outside, and to make it penetrate inwards only in this way: and draw out both extremities of the palm.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then draw out the point again and make the needle pass from the outside inwards through two extremities of the sponge, namely on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then draw out both [needles] once more, and make both penetrate from the inside outwards through two extremities of the sponge, namely on both sides opposite to each other.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this is the better way of stitching, and is the stitching of which the memory remains.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is as Galen also says
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some have said
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture is rectified from the inside with two needles
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, insert into each of the two sponges a single thread: and begin with the needle which is at your side, and make the needle pass through until it reaches the opposite side, according to the course of the suture which is to join together the two layers of skin equally
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you know that when a disruption occurs in the middle of the inside: then the suture of that is more difficult than that of the rest of the inside parts
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the quality of the medication of wounds is the judgment of the rest of the wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	When you follow a wound with its own blood, before it changes itself in air: and reduce the gut, and take hold of it, and place it: then place over it the powdered lard.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already changed the wound: then place over it some unguents, which are those which are present, until they make pus: and the thread will fall out, and consolidate the sponge, and dry it
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for this in the same way as the care of the rest of the wounds, until it heals
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If however these are not present [the necessary medicines], then place above it immediately, from which it begins to emit pus, a foul moisture: and change it twice a day until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	Since other medicines are not indicated in various situations when wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If however the wound communicates with the principal parts of the body in the lesion, then it is necessary to immerse wool wool in lukewarm water, or in rose water: and place it around the parts which are between the groin and the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If it feels pain, or swelling, or corruption in its intestines (for this often happens in this), then bathe it with wine vinegar, black pepper, and warm water: especially if corruption has already appeared in the intestine, and an opening has been made through it
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	You know that that which comes from the great intestine is easier to heal: and that which comes from the small intestine is more difficult to heal
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	The intestine which is called the jejunum, does not undergo healing from the wound which happens in it in any way: and this is because of the multitude of its veins, and the greatness of their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and because of its proximity to its own nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If however the matter which proceeds from the wound is bone, and you follow it up, reduce it according to your reduction of the intestines which you make equal
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If however it has passed beyond that space, and has become black, or dark: then you must tie it up with thread above the place which is degenerated from it, so that the blood flow does not happen again.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in bone there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut that which is beyond that ligament, and place two hanging ends of thread from the lower part of the wound outside of it: that it may alleviate the tension of that, and the extraction of that with regard to the case of the abscess, and the emission of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remember the wound that occurred in the Intestino.</start_of_turn>
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a disruption occurs in the Intestino, and it is small: then it is possible, in some people, to restore it: because I have seen that which was wounded in the belly with a lance and was on the right side of the stomach, and had been there for a long time: and a fistula was made, and it evacuated through it, and there was swelling.</start_of_turn>
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I put forward therefore a cure, until I am relieved in the healing of it: neither should you stop treating it until it is healed, and the place is consolidated.</start_of_turn
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	When I have seen that the place is consolidated, I fear over the sick person, that something bad might happen to the sick person in his belly: and nothing bad happened to him from that.</start_of_turn
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And it remained in better conditions, eating and drinking, and hopeful, and went into a bath, and exercised in his diet.</start_of_turn
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some experimenters say, when in the Intestino there is a wound, and it is small: then it is necessary to tie it up in this manner.</start_of_turn
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And take the large-headed ants.</start_of_turn>
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then gather together two lips of the wound, and place an ant on one of those which have an open bone over two lips of the wound.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When the head is above the body, and the limb is stretched out, cut off the head, for it adheres to it and does not separate.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another pin near the first one, and do not cease until you have made the second pin equal to the quantity of the wound throughout
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce the swelling and the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	The head remains attached to the intestines until the intestines are consumed, and healed, and does not cause harm to the patient
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	It is also possible to ligate the intestines with a fine thread: which has been taken from the intestines of animals and is attached to it after it has been introduced into the belly
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is necessary to grasp the extremity of this thread from the intestines and remove much of it.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then ligate at the extremity of it the thread which has been introduced.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then introduce this thread into the belly and ligate it with the intestines.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce it to disruption
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of stitching with pins and intestines is not without risk, except according to the degree of confidence and hope
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know that a wound which is great, wide, especially if it is in a large intestine: then there is no skill except careful handling, and no healing at all
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Of the care of wounds and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter 88
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know that every wound, or swelling when it becomes old and decays, and becomes a ulcer, and does not consolidate, and emits pus constantly, and does not separate: then it is called universally in every part of the body a fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And the fistula is indeed according to truth a nodate filtered vessel, firm, white: which having no pain has the convergence of the feather of a bird: and on account of this they call it Risati, that is, feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And at certain hours it becomes moist, which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture is split at certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is much, and sometimes little: and is great, and is soft
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have said before in the discourse, thus when I said that all wounds which do not heal, neither are born in this body, are not except for one new cause.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Which one is either because of the scarcity of blood in the body: or because of the malice of its nature: or because it is between itself and the lips of the body is hard tissue which hinders the birth of flesh: or because there is much pus and pus-like material: or because the wound itself is putrid, and the matter which issues from it is of bad quality: or because the treatment is unsuitable for its care: or because corruption is falling in the region which is a kind of pestilence: or by the property of the region, as it happens in Caesarea Augusta: in which there is great difficulty in digesting food and the healing of wounds is delayed by nature: or because in it is one bone, or many bones
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have shown all these causes and signs and their treatments with physicians in the discourse: and it is fitting here that I tell you the treatment of the fistula and the zuka, which is done by one operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	You know therefore that the fistula happens in all the members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For from these things are the fistulas which reach the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or intestines, or stomach, or bone, or skin, or bones of the wrist, or foot: or from some joints or compound bones: such as the hand and foot: and from these things which go towards the proximity of the main limb and those of like nature
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Whatsoever is the cause of these fistulas according to this method, is from difficult to heal ailments, and does not receive treatment, and the care of them is laborious and ignorant.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If anything of these fistulas has not reached the extent that I have mentioned, and if you hope and trust in its treatment, and wish to arrive at an understanding of it, then take hold of a knife or an iron, for if the fistula persists according to its nature, inquire about it with the fistula itself.</start_of_turn>
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If, however, there is a twist in the fistula, then investigate with a slight weight of lead.</start_of_turn>
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	For lead, with the gentleness of its body, alleviates the fistula and curves around the twist.</start_of_turn>
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If the fistula has many holes, it is not possible for you to describe over them with a single attempt.</start_of_turn
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Close up all the holes from their holes.</start_of_turn
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the humidity which closes them up again goes beyond the other holes and runs out from them.</start_of_turn
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then inquire carefully according to what method is possible: whether it is bone or nerve, and whether the fistula is long or short, or whether it is a single fistula with many holes, and is above all this with the sum of your strength: with your questioning of the patient, and the finding of pain on compression with your hand on the place, and similar symptoms and signs of the disease.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you have stood on all these points truly, then proceed to the treatment with confidence: and know that if the fistula is close and visible, or in a safe place distant from the juncture, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of those places which I mentioned to you: then dry out the fistula according to what has been said before concerning the narration, and remove what is in it from the filtration, and corrupt flesh, which is born in the hole of it from the flesh, or pus, or like this: and care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If, however, the fistula is of great length and depth, and is in accordance with the rule: then it is necessary that it be sectioned off as deeply as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then it must be ligated from all its diseased parts
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer ligatures of sharp knives: and introduce these until you reach the depth of the fistula as you comprehended it with the iron: do this as many times as necessary, until the acute medicine has eaten away everything that remains in the depth of the fistula from corruption
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore the part with bandages that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If, however, it does not heal by this, then cauterize it as we have narrated.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If, therefore, the cause of the fistula is bone, and you suspect this: then inquire about it, and section it off as we have narrated: if it does not prevent you from doing anything from the bone, or nerve, or major limb, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If, therefore, it is found that the bone is diseased and blackened: then burn it out, until the corruption is completely removed
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with that which nourishes it, until it is healed
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	When, however, it does not heal, and pus comes out of it as before: then you know that you have not reached the whole eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Investigate further concerning this, and make a careful examination of it, and its preparation with the utmost ability you possess
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If, therefore, it heals, it is good: and if not, then you know that this corruption is in a great depth of the body, which you have not overcome
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	No creature is exempt from suffering in this life, save only the one who departs from the natural order.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If the bone of the forearm is fractured, and it is possible to do so, draw it out with fine scissors which fit to that.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If there are many bones, then make careful traction of them all, and do not omit anything with your strength
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If there is something contrary to this from humors, and there is no fear of incision, or of an error: then cut through those humors and flesh, if they are there, and loosen the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If you are not prepared to extract the bone from its hour, then put over it something which will cause it to putrefy: and depart from it until it has putrefied all the surrounding flesh and humors of the bones
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And keep the wound closed so that it does not harden.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And bind the incision which you made in your operation
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	And put over it, if necessary, a cushion soaked in sulfur burnt with oil: or a cushion soaked in Egyptian unguent, or some other unguents of the like.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when these humors have putrefied, and have separated from the bones, the discharge of the wound will be less, and the attraction of the bones will be greater.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If there is a large bone, such as the femur or the tibia, and the like of these, which is fractured, it is a great part: then break off that part lastly, until the black spot and the corruption have disappeared
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If however that which is in it is corrupted, is a great part, and the corruption has already followed the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to amputate it, and to cut through it entirely until the corruption has ceased: then care for it, until it has healed
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you this, that which happened to me in my leg: so that you may take it as an example and aid for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	A youth of about thirty years of age had pain in his leg, because something had become loose within his body, that is, from within, until it reached the knee, and there was great swelling: and there was no external cause for it.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	It happened to a young man of about thirty years of age that he had pain in his leg, because something had become loose among his physicians, until it was opened, and there were many materials together with it
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And after the treatment was finished, when his knee was bound up, many holes were made in it: from which pus and moisture of the body came out
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	The doctors treated him for two years, but in this art there was no skill, until I came and saw his leg and the things which were coming out of his holes: for his whole body was pale, and his complexion was yellow
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	They tried to reach it in one place through a hole, and the attempt reached the bone
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the holes: and I found that they went into each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I treated him properly, and I sealed over one of those holes, until I found a piece of bone: and I found it corrupted: for it was rotten, and wrinkled, and had decayed, and had pierced through, until it had reached the marrow
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I saw that which was detected by me was prepared from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I deemed that there was no benefit in the bone except for that corruption, which I cut off and sealed
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I will have eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I shall order the restoration of the wound with the help of solid physicians over a long space of time.
Et non est consolidatum.	It is not complete
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried, and found on the second examination above the first: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I saw that even from that corruption there appeared to me something.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	I will attempt to restore it
Et non est restauratum.	It is not restored
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I found therefore above it again, and I did not cease to cut the bone piecemeal, and to try to restore it: and it is not restored, until I cut from the bone round about the palm of one hand, and I extracted that with the marrow itself
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with the physicians, and it was consolidated quickly, and healed: and there was no need for this repetition of the operation, and the section of it, except because of the weakness of the patient, and his little tolerance, and my fear of death for him, because it happened to him at every hour from the excessive evacuation of bad air.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He is healed therefore with perfect healing: and was made in the place of the hard bone, and a good disposition was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he recovered his strength in his dispositions: and did not make him contradict in walking or writing at all
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If however the prominent bone in the body is fractured: then it is necessary to bind it up according to this method: and that is: that you take hold of the ligament and bind the bone at the extremity of the prominent bone: and command someone to extend it upwards: and put another ligament of thicker thread than the first ligament.</start_of_turn>
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind the ligature above the flesh, which is on the bone: and extend its extremity, so that you may draw the flesh downwards: and you will see the flesh above the place where you wish to cut, so that it does not damage the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a stick or board under the lower bone centrally: because when you make that, it does not prevent the cutting of the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the suture be above the corrupted place somewhat, so that there is not a depression of the corruption of the bone: and that it does not appear to the sense, and that it compels towards the suture of itself or something else
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted and is not prominent, and the part is continued with the part: and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in the part itself: then remove the flesh from all the parts whole
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place a stick below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then cut that from the first part where the corruption is, until the suture continues from the other part: and let the suture be according to the length of the corruption somewhat, as we said
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is at the juncture, cut the corrupted juncture itself, and cut the bone where the other part continues
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If indeed the corruption is in the continuation of two junctions, then it is not in it without abrasion
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is in the palm of the hand, or in the palm of the foot: then things are difficult there.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But it is necessary to inquire about the nature of the corruption as it appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And scrape it off, and cleanse it as much as you are able, and with whatever skill you can manage: when it does not make you contradict a vein or a nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	You know that incisions and sutures are many for this bone, according to the position of the bone, its preparation, its size, its smoothness, its magnitude, its fineness, and its hardness.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore it is necessary to prepare an instrument appropriate for each type of operation for that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	You know that these operations are significant to you above the kind of instrument that you do not know when you have long studied it.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a proof of the knowledge of the methods of treatment: for then you will find for yourself what is suitable for every sickness from the instruments.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am firm in the last of this chapter concerning the number of instruments that you place as examples for those that you cut, and the trial which you will experience on others.
Forma Serrae.	The shape of the sutures.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The shape of the other sutures
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of the other sutures once more.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of the other sutures yet once more
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This shape of suture is made in the middle
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its arc be towards the upper part, its point from the iron: and its handle from the horn, and make it pyramid-shaped in the middle
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The shape of the connected sutures.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this suture be according to the shape of the head of the star: and its points according to the shape of the needles of the embroidery
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it does not fit, unless it is that they are rough against each other when they are broken, or the bone is wide and large.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Greater form of Rasassa.
Forma medii Rasorii.	Greater form of Rasassa.
Forma Rasorii lati.	Greater form of Rasassa
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	Greater form of Rasassa in which there is a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Greater form of the other Rasassa is subtle
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Greater form of the other Rasassa is blunt at the extremities
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	Greater form of the little, subtle Rasassa
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Greater form of Rasassa like that in which bones are cut
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Greater form of the great Rasassa too
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is like Radio, and the extremity is like a saw: it is shown in many places because of the reason for the bones
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	Greater form of Rasassa which agrees with the reason for its perforation by bones
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its extremity is triangular, and the extremity is acute
Fit ex Indi.	Like that of the Indians
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And it should be like that, as for all that we have said of Rasassa, Incision, and Saw
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	As for the incision of the extremities, and the suture of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter 89.</start_of_turn>
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	Extremities putrefy, either from an external cause, or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore you have treated the cause of the corruption with medical treatment, and it does not heal: and if you do not cut off the corruption in the limb, without which nothing helps: then you must cut off that limb until the corruption has ceased, so that the patient may be saved from death, or from the greater defect of the limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign which indicates that this has happened is that the limb is blackened, until it is consumed by fire or putrefies after blackness: until that putrescence occurs up to and including that which follows the limb, and spreads throughout the body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	And thus with its incision, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is a blow from some venomous creatures: as the scorpion of the sea, and the viper, and the spider, and those of a similar kind.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore the corruption or the blow is at the extremity of the finger, then cut off the finger, and do not leave any space for the corruption, but drive it right up to the remainder of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut off the hand from the root of the bone, and do not leave any space for the corruption, until it has seized in the bone of the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it reaches the arm, then cut off the arm at the elbow in its joint
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if the corruption has passed beyond this, and you see it surrounding the elbow: then in that is the death of the patient.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to manage besides this from the cure is the quantity of medicine.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And thus do the same with the foot, when the corruption reaches the toe, then cut it off at one of the joints: and if it has reached the heel, then cut off the whole foot
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If however it reaches the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	And if the corruption has passed above the knee, then it is not in that there is any remedy, except dismissal, and leaving the patient to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the way to cut off a limb, or to save it, is as follows: tighten the ligaments in the lower part which you wish to cut: and tighten the ligament above in the place of that which you have cut
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And extend the minister of one ligament to the lower parts: and extend the minister of another ligament to the upper parts.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And thou shalt separate the flesh which is between two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until the whole flesh be detached
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it is cut, or it is returned back
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that thou put on all parts of the linen cloth, and that thou avoid the place of health: and thou must add to the infirm wound, and the swelling must be cooled.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If indeed there should flow forth blood within the work, then thou must cauterize the place quickly: or put upon it some powder which will absorb the blood
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to thy medication until it be complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind up the wounded limb with a ligament which is suitable for it, and care for it until it be healed.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I say unto thee that this happened to me in my foot, thus did this happen to me
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because it happened to me in my foot in the night, with a wound which assimilates the heat of fire: and the corruption of that first happened in my finger, until the whole foot was affected
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	I did therefore extract the man from his suffering, after I had cut away the corruption of the limb with its disease, which appeared from pain and inflammation: and I cut it at the junction, and it was healed
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, it happened to him again in the finger of his hand at the index finger.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He came to me, and I attempted to cure her with the things which I placed upon her hand after the cleansing of her body: and the superfluity did not cease, but began to proceed into another finger: until the corruption reached the hand itself
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called me to do it: to make an incision in his hand. I did not wish to do it, hoping that from me would come the return of his superfluous [tissue]: and I was also afraid of death itself at the hand of the incision in his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the patient was very sick.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	When he had despaired of me, he returned to the earth: and he came to me again, because he was in urgent need, and he made an incision in his whole hand: and he was healed.</start_of_turn>
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.

¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	On the treatment of bones, and the quality of blistering with physicians.</start_of_turn>
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.</start_of_turn>
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When a swelling occurs in some limb by a wound, and the swelling persists until collection of pus has taken place: then the swelling is broken, or pierced, and the pus which is in it is ejected, and that which is left is like a wound: and the skin which is over it is like a thin membrane: and it does not reach its utmost corruption, neither does it affect bone, nor nerve, nor ligament: it is called a sinus and not a fistula, unless its space is prolonged, until corruption affects some part of the limb, then it is called a fistula or swelling.</start_of_turn
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	Its care is that you cut through the whole skin as it is turned back: and especially when it is thinned out, and made like a membrane: and trust that it will not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.</start_of_turn
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	If, however, you hope that the skin will adhere, and that this is not the final consequence of the corruption: and if there is hardness in the skin from the flesh: then treat it with blistering: and consider it as a sinus.</start_of_turn
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	If it is great, and the pus which issues from it is foetid of odor: then clench it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and alum, equal parts, gathered in a vessel: and boil them over fire until the medicine turns red. Then comes in the thickness of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what is necessary: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clench it with vinegar: and string its orifice, and discharge the medicine into it in the quantity of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then draw it out with pressure: do this for several days, until the sinus is healed, and the odor is gone.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when it is clenchied with vinegar and water of ashes, when it is not present this medicine: then take ashes of wood chips, or ashes of the ilex tree: and sprinkle them on water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then boil the water, and clench it with these things, until you are confident that the sinus is healed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient does not tolerate vinegar, or water of ashes, then clench it with water and honey, to which something of ground alum has been added
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or clench it with honey and wine mixed together, because of the property of honey to heal, and to cleanse: and the wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in it.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done this often, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has passed away: then clench it with something which makes flesh grow in it
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is good to take from aloe of Spain: and dissolve it with rose oil and wine: or clench it with some medicine, and anoint with others, of whose properties are written in the treatise on unguents.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the orifice of the sinus is strict, so that a cannula will not pass through it, then enlarge it with a small iron [instrument]: or place within it a piece of lint soaked in Egyptian unguent, or in basilicon unguent, until it is enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then close its lips with sutures: and discharge from it the amount that enters the bladder without adding anything.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if pus comes from that orifice, it is elevated upwards: then dry it in the hollow place which is in it, so that it comes out from there downwards: for pus when coarsened in the depth of the sinus, hinders the generation of flesh in that place.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	And if it is not possible to dry the sinus round about downwards as you wish: then attempt to prepare the limb with the preparation which brings out pus easily as you prepare it.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Attempt to discharge all the pus from it entirely: and take solidified medicines which are placed above the sign, suitable for that which you wish
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend these things over the edge of the wound.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the size of the wound be such as to permit communication of the whole sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with scissors directly at the orifice of the sinus with a larger opening of the sinus at the same time.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend from the soft parts above the wound, according to the size of the hole: and place it over that in a long position from the orifice of the sinus, so as to relieve the discharge of pus from that place: and do not make the wound large, except after a few days when one wishes to do so.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	He who is above the orifice of the sinus must move in every hour, so that it may go out what is gathered in it from the pus: and that you may know whether that which comes out of it is much or little: or digested or undigested
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And thus again consider the place of the sinus itself, whether in it does the master himself feel pain, or is there no pain in it, and whether there is swelling in it, or is there no swelling in it.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When you have proceeded thus with your treatment in this way, and you have washed the material which issues from the orifice of the sinus, then you will know whether the sinus is adhered, or is approaching adherence: then indeed you must resolve it in the mane, or on the third day. And when you have resolved the ulcer, then exchange the dressing and renew the unguentum.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	If, however, it issues from the sinus after a long space of time with a slight discharge, then you must not despair of its adherence, for its healing approaches, because there are men who are slow to generate flesh in their ulcers, and there are those who act contrariwise to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If, however, it issues from the sinus after many days with undigested pus, then you know that the sinus is not adhered.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If, therefore, the adherence of the sinus is delayed and its condition is prolonged: then add to the medication drying agents, truly making the doctors do so, that there may be moisture in their body and dryness in their sweat: like alum, when added to fat, it makes fat dry.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the last thing which is to be done, that you take alum and dissolve it with rosewater, and apply it over the old wound equal in amount to the body of the wound.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then cover it with that, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And thus it is done like this, when there is no alum available, honey, when you dissolve it, until it is absorbed, and with it the other things that are in it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Take myrrh, aloes, and olibanum: mix them all together, and sprinkle that over honey while it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then smear upon the vessel itself, and bind it upon the Sinus: and smear with the honey which you have boiled, until it is thick: and sprinkle upon it the aforesaid things, and place upon the vessel itself, and bind it.</start_of_turn>
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when it is administered in that vessel, long are the aristolochia and the roots of lilies of heaven, and is lily: and barley of herbs, and centaurea.</start_of_turn>
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use either simple or compound things, mix them together: sprinkle that over honey as I have said, and use that.</start_of_turn>
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, the condition of the Sinus is prolonged and does not heal by this treatment: then you know that there is corruption in its depth: or that it makes an imprint in the bones, or in the other hard parts, or ligaments: then care for the fistula according to what has been said before.</start_of_turn
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Of the care of panaritius and nails drawn out, and incision of the finger added, and section.</start_of_turn
Caput XCI.	Chapter 101.</start_of_turn>
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritius is a swelling which arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot: and perhaps arises in the other fingers.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When, however, its duration is prolonged, and it is neglected in its treatment, and a swelling arises from the swelling, or it is corrupted, and pus is emitted, until it corrupts the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts the whole thing, and perhaps the corruption extends to the bone, until there is a foul odor: and the extremity of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.</start_of_turn
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When you are treating yourself, as we have said before, and the cure does not take effect: then it is necessary that you cut off with the sword the entire superfluous part which remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the nail afterwards.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	The cautery is useful for nails which are inflamed.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If indeed the bone is sound, and the nail is also sound, and the swelling of the nail has become excessive, and it bites itself, and causes pain: then it is necessary to place radium beneath the nail at an angle where it bites the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut away the flesh easily, and place upon it what remains of the flesh from the burning and corrosive medicines until it has disappeared entirely
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with unguents until it is healed
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If however corruption has set in the bone, then it is necessary to cut away that bone and extract it: for it will never heal as long as it remains corrupted in that bone
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see the corrosion and corruption advancing in the finger: then cut it off at one of its joints, as has been mentioned previously concerning its reminder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If however there occurs to the nail attrition or percussion: and it brings about pain which is unbearable: then it is necessary to perform a bloodletting in the first instance.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail with sharp Spatumil from above downwards to the end.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And be careful, lest the cutting should reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will thereby cause the addition of further pain to the already existing pain, and will be the cause of the corruption of the flesh in that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the place with that which sits down the pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	Then care for the place with that which sits down the pain.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Then care for the place with that which sits down the pain.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Then care for the place with that which sits down the pain
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	Then care for the place with that which sits down the pain, that is, as you would an Incision with a Spatulum.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	Then care for the place with that which sits down the pain, that is, as you would an Incision with a Spatulum. The care of that which is born in the root of the junction is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Then care for the place with that which sits down the pain. Abstain from its Incision.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	Then care for the place with that which sits down the pain. In that which is born at the end of the fingers, then it is necessary to Incline in the first meat of it by a circular Incision until you reach the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then care for the place with that which sits down the pain. Then saw the bone with one saw compatible with this.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with that which sits down the pain. Then care for the thing itself until it is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	Then care for the place with that which sits down the pain. Consolidation which happens to the fingers because of the wound or by the nature of man himself, that is, because it is born with it, or from the consolidation of the wound, or from burning fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Then care for the place with that which sits down the pain. It is necessary to dissect that consolidation, until the fingers return to their natural form
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then care for the place with that which sits down the pain. Then put between them pins, or soak with infused lead in rose water: so that they do not solidify too quickly, and separate between them: or put between them a thin sheet of lead, until the place is consolidated as it should be
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly, if consolidation has occurred in some fingers with the palm, then dry that consolidation, according to what is prepared and agrees with the figure of the limb.

Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	There are veins which are involved, large and full of melancholic superfluities that happen in various parts of the body: and most frequently in the legs, especially in those of travelers and laborers, and those who bear burdens.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	It is necessary therefore that you manage the exclusion of the body from black bile somewhat forcefully with an expulsion.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then let a bloodletting be made from the patient with ease by means of a balsam.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of these with iron is in two ways
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One is that it be cut through, and the black blood be extracted
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	The other is that the vein be elevated and the whole of it extracted
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The cutting of it is done in this way
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Embalm the ankle at first with warm water much, until the thick blood is resolved
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the ankle of the sick from the upper part of the thigh down to the lower part of the knee with a strap
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then dry the vein in one place, or two, or three wide sections
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then elevate, that is, extract the blood from the lower part of the leg up to the upper part, and from the upper part let the patient bleed in the first place
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then dry the limb until the quantity of blood that has bled out is equal to what is needed for the treatment, and as much as the patient can tolerate
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	After the ligature is made: and command him to abstain from foods that generate black bile: and repeat the enema and phlebotomy when the veins are full, for this will be harmful to the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The elevation of the limb is done in this way.</start_of_turn>
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	If there are many hairs on the limb of the patient, shave them off.</start_of_turn>
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then immerse the limb in a bath: or embroider it in the limb with warm water, until it turns red, and swell the veins: or perform a strong exercise, if there is no bath available, until the limb is warmed.</start_of_turn>
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin along the course of the vein: or at its end near the knee, or at its end near the heel.</start_of_turn
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and scrape the vein from all sides, until sensation is restored: and it is known when sensation returns, that the bile has been evacuated from the vein.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When the blood has gone out of the skin, the surgeon should wipe off the blood as if it were a cord.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then place under it radium, until it rises up and comes out of the skin: suspend the blood with a piece of gauze, soft.</start_of_turn
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry the other side near that three fingers away.</start_of_turn
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein, until sensation appears.</start_of_turn
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then raise the limb with the radium as before, and suspend the blood with another piece of gauze, as you did at the beginning.</start_of_turn
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry the other side, or several other sides, if necessary.</start_of_turn>
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then elevate it, and pierce the last part near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then extract the bone to the part which is above the sole of the foot.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	Do this until you have extracted the bone from the higher sections, until all bones have gone out: then pierce the bone
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If, however, it does not obey you for extracting and elevating: then insert a sharp needle with a strong thread, and bind the bone, and extract it: or insert under it radium: and move your hand over every part, until it comes out
Et caue, ne incidatur.	Take heed, lest you pierce it
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if you pierce it, it becomes difficult to elevate the bone again, and it enters through that wound.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you have extracted the whole bone: then place over the wound a soaked wool bandage in wine and rose oil, or oil: and care for it, until it is healed
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vein is contracted, having a twist which has to do with parts, and is not like what we said according to the straight line: then you must find over the bone to every part of the twist of it, and the place of the twist itself
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend the bone with needles, until you have elevated the whole bone: and take heed at your incision on the bone so that you do not pierce the vein, or wound it: for it is difficult to elevate or extract the bone again
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Be prudent in this matter.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	Make the incision in such a way that the vein heals.
Forma Vncini caeci.	Leave the surrounding area clean
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It has no acute extremity like the rest of the incisions, and is not of a fine character, so as not to wound the vein: and it has a large flexibility, gentle: for if it were fine, it would wound the vein by its slightness: and if it were of a large size, like this, it would be useless
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the vein of the thigh.
Caput XCIII.	On the extraction of the vein of the thigh.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the thighs in warm lands, like Alizegi and Arabia, and in dry and warm lands, few in number, for in them no herb or tree grows.</start_of_turn>
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	It is also perhaps generated in other parts of the body besides the thighs.</start_of_turn
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is from the putrefaction which happens under the skin, like that which happens within the bodies of serpents and worms, and worms generated between the skin and the flesh.</start_of_turn
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the commencement of this vein is inflammation in the thigh which is painful.</start_of_turn
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place is to be dried.</start_of_turn
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein is to be extracted from the place of its drying, like the root of a plant, or an animal.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When it appears from this extremity, then it is necessary to cover over the lead with leaden weights whose weight is from a drachma to two drachmas and a node: and let go of the lead weight from the thigh.</start_of_turn
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever it comes out from that to the exterior, cover it in lead and tie it down.</start_of_turn
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it persists for a long time, then cut off a part of it, and cover the rest.</start_of_turn
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut through the root before it has come out whole.</start_of_turn
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut through it, it contracts and enters the flesh: and causes inflammation, and gangrene in the place, and a bad ulcer.</start_of_turn
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Wherever it is necessary, it should be gently evacuated, and drawn out gradually, until nothing remains within, and that nothing remains in the body: and from this vein, in some men, there comes out that which is equal in length to five palms and ten fingers.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And thus it is with me, because the urine has gone out of twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if it happens to you in the hour of your medication: then insert radium into its cavity, and perforate the cavity with a needle as long as the body, until all that is in it is evacuated: and administer the putrefaction of the place with the physicians for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then care for the aftercare of the wound.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the junction of the foot, or in the foot itself: and it has many outlets, and comes out of every outlet branch.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Care for it in this way, as we said in the previous discourse, and as we have said before

Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called in this land among us the bovine disease: because it often happens to bulls, and is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it goes throughout the body, ascending and descending: and it is seen by the sense when it walks from limb to limb, until it bursts in the place where it bursts through the skin at the location, and comes out
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the decay of some humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As worms and serpents do, so too do lumbrici and ascarides within.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	They are mischievous like serpents and worms.</start_of_turn>
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	For when it itself enters the body, and rises to the head, and proceeds to a place: then it may well burst open there and go out, and destroy the eye: and such an event happens often.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When it is thus to be treated and removed, it is not to be omitted from its walking and its sensation.</start_of_turn>
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	It is necessary therefore to bind that which is above it and that which is below it with a strong ligature.</start_of_turn>
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over it and remove it.</start_of_turn
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it has gone deep into the flesh and you do not find it: then place above the place a burn with fire until it dies.</start_of_turn
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And greater than this is the corruption of its matter, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If however you find it to have gone up to the head near the eye: then bind under it over the eyebrow a good strong ligature.</start_of_turn
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over it and remove it.</start_of_turn
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the sick man should take care of the purification of his body, with doctors who will dissolve harmful humors.</start_of_turn

Caput XCV.	Chapter XCV.</start_of_turn>
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This ailment is known in our land as Nakir: and it is a pain which happens in some members: and then changes from member to member.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	I myself have seen this, as I have told you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a woman who was sick in some village
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And I found her arm swollen, and I saw a swelling in the groin of her arm
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after an hour had passed, I saw that the swelling had increased in size like a worm, ascending towards her shoulder more quickly than is possible: like silver that is running from one place to another
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	The pain thus withdrew from that place and settled in the shoulder
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	And an hour later it had spread throughout the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	And she told me that it had disappeared throughout her whole body, as I saw
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was amazed at the speed of its change from member to member
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I had never seen such an ailment before in my life in the same way as this
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I have heard of many people who suffer from a pain that changes from member to member: but I have never seen anything like this before.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	I do not believe this is possible, except perhaps because of the woman's position in the village: hence it appears that the pain has been transmitted from the lower parts of the body to the upper parts.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	It is necessary that this does not appear in delicate people and those with moist bodies, in whom the hidden veins are more easily affected.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When therefore the physician has finished his treatment and the patient still feels pain, if it be apparent to the physician's eye, as we have said, then he should bind above and below the painful part with greater force: and he should dry above the painful part until the swelling has subsided; and he should cauterize the spot.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If, however, he does not see it with his eyes: then he must treat it with an outward dressing, and with that which drives out the swelling, and he must rub it with unguents of foetid herbs and of serapion, and like things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	(The provided text does not include the continuation of the sentence regarding the extraction of arrows, so I cannot provide a translation for it.)
Caput XCVI.	Chapter XCVI.</start_of_turn>
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are varied according to their kind and according to the place from which they are drawn from the body.</start_of_turn>
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	And their variety is such: because some have large spines and some have small; and some are concave and some are convex.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And some have three angles.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And some have tongues.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And some have stars.</start_of_turn
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	As for those which are according to the limbs in which they are found, there are two ways.</start_of_turn
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or the limbs are from those which are concave in their main parts, such as the brain, and the heart, and the spleen, and the lung, and the kidneys, and the intestines, and the bladder, and things like these.</start_of_turn
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it falls into any of these limbs, and it appears to you that there is a sign of death, as I shall tell you afterwards, then it is necessary to draw out that arrow from the limb, for death follows its wound in many arrangements.</start_of_turn
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	When the signs of illness are not apparent, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the limb, then extract it and care for the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	When the signs are absent and the arrow has penetrated the bone, and comes out upon the brain, it is: because from that there arise vomiting, spasms, swelling, redness of the eyes, diarrhea, redness of the tongue, spasm, and mixture of the intellect, and vomiting of bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood will issue from the nostrils or ears
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech will be severed, and the voice will be destroyed
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And there will issue from the wound a white moisture resembling pus
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And there will come out from it like the discharge from a wound
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If, however, these signs appear, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow that has fallen into the cord are: that it is itself near the left breast: and that it feels as though it is fixed in something hard, not in something soft.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow is in motion like the pulse: and blood flows from the wound black.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And follows this coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	You know therefore that death approaches with doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	The sign of an arrow that has pierced the lung is the discharge of bloody foam from the wound: and the after-effects which follow the collarbone become swollen and change color of the patient.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And the great and high spirit departs: and it seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If an arrow falls into the chest, that is near the flanks: then it is close to the back parts: and it makes a great sigh with pain and aspiration, with a gasp: and it moves all the limbs of the arms.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if an arrow falls into the stomach: then perhaps it will come out through the wound from some undigested food
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow falls into the belly, and it lies there: something of stool, or bile, or intestine which has been broken will come out through the wound
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is no hope in the cure of it, neither in the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If an arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out: and something comes out from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger over the sick person: then you know that it is deadly
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The rest of the limbs, such as the face, and the neck, and the gut, and the palate, and the attendants, and the scapulae, and the ribs, and the shoulder, and the thigh, and the ankle, and the heel, and similar members: when it does not find the arrow an artery or a nerve: and there is no venomous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you that I have heard that there are many such arrows, that you may know about the cure for it
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is, because I take care that the arrow may fall into the tear of his eye, or in the root of his nose
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	I extracted it for him from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no wound remained in his eye
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had fallen into the fat of his eye under his lower eyelid: and the arrow was hidden, and I did not find its tip from it, since it was stuck in its wood: and it was a great arrow of the Turks, with lead, in which there were no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The healed man is indeed a Jew, and no evil thing has befallen his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I have drawn out another arrow from the belly of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	It was an Arab arrow, and this is the one which has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	Behind it [the arrow] on the same side between two ribs: and it was submerged in his belly
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I have been careful with her [the arrow] until I have extracted it: and the Christian is healed
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I have drawn out another arrow which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that it would surely kill him
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	When thirty days had passed by and nothing had changed in his condition from before concerning his disposition, behind the arrow: we considered concerning the arrow, and I drew it out: and he was healed, and no evil thing befell him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man whose arrow had fallen in his back, and his wound was closed over the arrow
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	When seven years had passed by, the arrow was extracted from the root of his hip bone.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman whose arrow had fallen into her belly, and her wound was closed over the arrow, and the arrow remained inside her: and no change occurred in her condition from her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man whose arrow had fallen on his face: and his wound was closed over, and the arrow remained, without causing him much pain: and similar things happened often
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I drew out an arrow from the king's head, which had fallen in the middle of his nose, and it had inclined towards the right side: and the arrow was completely hidden
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I am called therefore to care for him until three days after the case of the arrow.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I find the wound of the arrow strict and swollen upwards
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I questioned him concerning the pain with a subtle touch, and he did not feel it: and even I found that he had a puncture wound and pain on his right side
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I hope that it is the wound of the arrow which is the cause of the puncture
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I plastered the place with a plaster which had an attractive and digestible powder, confident that the wound would dry up, and that I would see a sign of the arrow, that is to say that the tip of the arrow would remain on the surface: and it did not happen in the place of the accident that the arrow had followed the wound to the place.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I remained with the plaster for many days: and it did not happen that there was an accident, and the wound became consolidated in the meantime: and he remained unable to extract the arrow until he felt the arrow enter his nose on a certain day.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I placed above it an acute medicine which was corrosive for many days: and when I finally touched it, and felt the tip of the arrow which was adhering to the wood
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound by that acute medicine until we saw the tip of the arrow clearly: and it passed from us after that for about four months
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then when the wound had healed, and it was possible for me to introduce forceps into the wound, and to move it, and it did not obey my order to go out: then I did not cease to touch it, and I devised various methods for it on the surface of the wound, until on a certain day I put on the wound with forceps that were well-made, following their form at the end of the chapter, until I extracted the arrow.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the limb.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And the physicians say that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I restored it therefore, and the limb was consolidated, and the illness was healed whole: nothing further was required of it.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the manner in which I extracted some arrows: in order that you may know the rule and the signification of this which I have not said
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended by narration: neither does this book comprehend them, and a prudent craftsman compares them with little to much: and with that which is present, with that which is absent: and he finds a new operation and a new instrument among the descent of things extraneous to this art when these occur
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that arrows do not depart from the limbs in which they are fixed, except according to two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by drawing out from the place from which they entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by counter-drawing out a part of the other
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And whatever comes out from where it entered, whether it is an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: it is drawn out and comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not obey the coming out from the hour in which it fell: then it is necessary that you wait a few days, until the carrion which is around it has become putrid: and you will alleviate the drawing out of it, and its going out
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And in like manner if it is fixed in bone, and does not obey you concerning coming out: then you must also wait a few days: and repeat the drawing out and the motion every day, until it comes out
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not obey you concerning coming out after days: then it is necessary that you perforate all around the arrow in the very bone with a fine thread, until the arrow is amplified
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw the loop, and draw it out.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If, however, the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has gone forward into one of the ventricles of the brain, and if any of the accidents which I mentioned appear on the diseased side: then abstain from drawing the arrow, and withdraw the loop, until it is equal to the former state.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow continues until the ear, then the life is not prolonged thereby
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	If the arrow is not fixed in the body of a bone only, but does not penetrate as far as the ear: and if the patient remains sick for some days without any of the accidents having happened to him: then proceed with the drawing of the arrow and its extraction
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If, however, it is fixed firmly and does not obey your drawing: then apply pressure around the arrow as I have told you before: then care for the place, until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If, however, the arrow has gone completely away from the body, and is hidden and covered from the sense: then inquire about the loop with a hook.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel the loop, then draw the loop with some instruments that are suitable for its drawing.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If, however, you are unable to do so because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow in the depth: and there is no bone, no nerve, or blood vessel there: then find over the loop until the wound is enlarged, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If there are ears which hold the flesh fixed in the bone from all sides, all by means which you can think of, and if you can think of nothing which can liberate them except the fracture of the ears and their torsion: then leave them alone
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	When you perform the extraction of the arrow in any place, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps to all parts, until you have made the loop leave: and take away the last little bit slowly, so that the arrow is not broken, and that its drawing and extraction are not difficult.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If it is not possible to complete the procedure within an hour, then defer it for a few days until the surrounding tissues have decayed.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat the procedure: if it is causing excessive bleeding, stop the procedure until the bleeding has ceased. Then perform what we have said in the chapter on wound management. Guard your virtue from the incision of a vein, nerve, or cord.</start_of_turn>
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	Perform the procedure in every way that you can to facilitate healing of the arrow: do so with ease, tranquility, or slowly and steadily, as I have said.</start_of_turn>
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that you draw out the arrow so that the patient remains in the same position as before the arrow was placed, as it is with the case of the arrow itself.</start_of_turn
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For it is more harmful to leave the arrow in than to draw it out.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If it is not possible to draw out the arrow, then perform what you can from the figure.</start_of_turn
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The arrow which comes out from the opposite side of the body, or which proceeds from that to the exterior: or it makes a swelling at the extremity of the arrow in the sense from the upper part of the skin close to it, and raises up the surrounding: dry therefore above the wound, and make an incision according to the amount that can be grasped with the forceps.</start_of_turn
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then draw out the arrow: it will come out easily by itself.</start_of_turn
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If it is retained in the bone, then turn your hand according to the circumference, until you press the arrow into the bone, and expand it: then draw it out.</start_of_turn
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: defer the procedure for a few days: then repeat the procedure until it comes out.</start_of_turn
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the bowwood is in it, then push it out with the same.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If the bowwood has broken, and you wish to give it an impulse: then introduce into the instrument a concave instrument, so that its concavity may fill the cavity of the bowwood: then push out the bowwood with the same.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If the bow is concave, then push out the bow with the instrument that enters it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	The bow will straighten itself by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the bow is poisonous, then it is necessary to cut off the whole flesh in which the poison is: if this is possible
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of the bow with the thing that agrees with it.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the bow has fallen in the chest, or in the belly, or in the groin, or on the side: and it is close to the thing which you touch with your finger, and it is possible to cut above the wound: then cut, and burn from the incision of the vein, or nerve, and take out the bow.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then drain the wound, if there is blood, and take care of it until it is healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	This is the form of forceps by which the bow is extracted
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	The extremities are similar to the beak of a bird, which are made like iron: when they grasp the bow, they do not diminish the bow
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And there are many kinds of forceps, great and small, medium and large, according to the quantity of the magnitude of the bow, and the thinness or thickness of the wound, and the constriction of it
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The shape of the concave impulse.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	The shape of the blunt impulse
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the extremity of the forearm as in the radius, that its entrance into the sagittal bow may be alleviated by it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The proximal part of the forearm resembles the wing of a bird: its entrance into the sagittal bow is alleviated by its concavity
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	(Continuation of the previous translation
Caput XCVII.	(End of translation
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	The veins suitable for phlebotomy, which are found throughout the body, are thirty in number.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	Of these, six are in the head: two pulse- veins, which are behind the ears, two Herbae veins, two Arteriae which appear in two temporal regions, two lachrymal veins of the two eyes, which are called Aspicientes, a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead, and a vein at the tip of the nose
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two Guidegi veins, which are in the neck
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	And two veins which are in the lower lip
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	These are the Algecherich veins.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	And two veins which are under the tongue
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	As for the veins of the arms, there are five in each arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	One of them is the Cephalica vein, which is from the lateral side of the shoulder: and it is called the armpit vein.
Et Fusca.	And the Brachialis.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	And the Median vein, which is composed of the branches of the basilica and the cephalic veins: and it is called the body vein
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	Both Basilica and Titillicaris are situated in the domestic side.
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	The people call it Titillicaris within the house.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	The brachial vein is situated above the elbow: it is in that part from which blood is drawn, and that appears above the thumb when the hand is clenched

¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Of three veins in the cubit.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	There are three veins in the cubit that are commonly bled.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	They are bled in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by means of a broad lancet or by means of an olive oil compress or by cutting with a knife, as is practiced by Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is his method.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is right, as regards the section.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from these two kinds there are broad and subtle kinds according to the amplitude of the veins and the tension of their form. The form of phlebotomy with the lancet is broad like water
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening wide veins that are swollen, distended, apparent, large, and containing thick blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotomy is of smaller breadth and greater fineness of touch
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for bleeding small veins which contain thin yellow blood
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Of the phlebotomy of the basilica.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The basilica is one of these three veins which is used for phlebotomy.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it takes blood from the swellings which are under the jaw and the collarbone, from that which follows to the chest, and the abdomen: and it is suitable for the phlebotomist because of the risk of causing damage to the artery from which blood is not taken
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore he is careless and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will break that artery and the blood flow will cease.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Wherever it is necessary, do not perform a phlebotomy with a phlebotome that is still sharp: rather, make it blunt like Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the condition does not clearly manifest itself, then it is necessary to examine other parts of the body, or to ask about other symptoms: or to perform a phlebotomy in the place of the Funem brachii vein.</start_of_turn>
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For indeed it is evident, and must be made blunt like the phlebotome of Anesil, as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If you wish to perform a phlebotomy on the limb itself, then before you tighten the tourniquet on the limb, touch the area to ascertain the location of the pulse.</start_of_turn>
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then place the sign over the area with the burn, afterwards the arm, and make the vein section concave with the phlebotome like Alnesil, as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	Take care that the incision does not reach the artery.</start_of_turn
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	When you have finished, when you tighten the ligature, the swelling in the place that you marked with the burn, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: you must therefore stop it.</start_of_turn
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If blood spurts out at the phlebotomy, like the urine of a child, and is thin and red: then you know that it is from the artery.</start_of_turn
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then you must be quick, and place your finger on the area that you are working on, and then remove your finger.</start_of_turn
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If blood continues to spurt (since it is likely to have spurted a great deal), then tighten the limb and let go: and beware lest the patient move: and stay calm about the patient's fear.</start_of_turn
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Neither does it move for a few days until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If blood does not clot and the swelling increases: and it is not present to you in this moment of your medicine, then cut the artery if necessary.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities contract and blood clots.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Take off the outer skin of the flesh, and find the bone: take hold of one middle and bind it above the joint with a ligature and strings until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood clots, that is good
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then take care of it as is remembered from the place of the powdered blood which flows out: and the cutting of blood in these things is not difficult because of the smallness of the wound and the possibility of the ligature from the arm
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	Of the phlebotomy of the elbow
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The veins of the elbow for phlebotomy are considered to be those that draw blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: because they are composed of the branch of the basilica and the branch of the cephalic, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	It is necessary for the phlebotomist to be aware of the position of the vein in relation to the phlebotomy, for under it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore the puncture of the phlebotomy adds to the injury of the nerve, and it finds the nerve, it will result in that stupor, and the healing of it will be difficult, and it may not heal at all
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve is perceived by many sensations
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	If however it is hidden in some people, and is faint, and is not visible: then you must take care that you make the phlebotomy as low as possible, sectioning with Alnesil, and cutting the nerve with your skill
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If there is a bone between two nerves, then find the bone in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	If there is a bone between two nerves, then find the bone along its length.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	Phlebotomies of the cephalic bone are useful because they draw blood from the head and supply it to the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	It is necessary to perform incisions on the proper bone only, if necessary, as when performing phlebotomy with olive oil, or with myrtle: for it is safer for all veins than for arteries or nerves.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	It is appropriate to join together with the phlebotomy, that is to say, to make an opening only as large as necessary, and to seek a softer place: and it does not harm if it is not found at the first blow, as it will return with subsequent phlebotomies
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	Indeed, sometimes a swelling appears in some people when no phlebotomy is performed at the first blow, but it does not harm them in any way
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Of the usefulness of phlebotomy, and precautions to be observed in its practice.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of phlebotomy, and the accidents which arise from it, in whose rectification you must think carefully
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Firstly, you must know that phlebotomy is not administered except in the conservation of health, and for the maintenance of well-being, and for the prevention of ailments.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And for the three veins which are in the cubit, namely the cephalic, the cubital, and the basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And for phlebotomy in the beginning of spring over fasting, in summer, and autumn, and in winter after the harvest, when there are signs of repletion
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And let the phlebotomy be done on the first or third day after three hours have passed.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Phlebotomy is done in ailments whenever convenience and need dictate, whether at night or day, at any hour, in any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	It is not to be done on children until they are fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Neither should it be done to a pregnant woman except from the fourth month until the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor to old people who have passed their sixty-fifth year
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When anyone wishes to undergo phlebotomy for whatever reason: it is necessary beforehand to cleanse the intestines with mild laxatives, if there is much retained stool in the intestines: in order that they do not draw out harmful pus from the intestines to the principal parts during the phlebotomy
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Neither should it be done to a patient suffering from acute vomiting, nor to a drunkard or someone suffering from excessive drunkenness until these conditions have subsided from the body
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor to a patient with dropsy
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And care should be taken that phlebotomy is not repeated too soon after a bout of colics, vomiting, flux of the bowels, multiplication of sexual intercourse, laborious work, exercise, joy, fasting, or any other thing that dissolves strength from the body or animal
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider in the subtlity of humors before this, if the blood is thick with food and drink, and the physicians: if possible do this for him
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let a bath be taken, if it does not forbid this: or some exercise be performed, in order to lighten the blood.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And make an incision in the belly, about the third of the day, as we have said: and strive that he may evacuate his belly from all the harmful accidents of animals, such as constriction, and wrath, and fear: and from all the accidental misfortunes of the body, such as toil, and pain, and luxury, and like those.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let its juices be present with things which customarily accompany human use of aromatic substances, and fragrance, and delight, and like those in quantity as is possible.</start_of_turn>
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then sit the phlebotomist above the elbow, which is higher than the elbow of the phlebotomist: then extract his arm, and rub it with his hand twice, or thrice.</start_of_turn>
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then tighten the ligament with forceps, and bind it twice.</start_of_turn
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the tightening be moderate, for when the tightening is unequal, or through excess in the tightening, it hinders the course of the blood: or in softening, and even then it hinders the course of the blood.</start_of_turn
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the tightening, it is necessary to rub the phlebotomized hand with the palm of the hand towards the inside, until the veins are engorged, and the sensation returns.</start_of_turn>
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist will withdraw the phlebotome with a little oil, as before.</start_of_turn
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he places his index finger of his left hand over the vein at the place where he wishes to make the incision, slightly: so that it does not escape the vein, and to prevent bruising.</start_of_turn
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For from the veins is as from a flying chord at the phlebotomy: and from these is what is filled with wind: and when you put the phlebotome on it, it contracts under the phlebotomy, and the phlebotomist is thrown down, and the phlebotomy is not opened by the vein: and if it is opened, it is tight: because of this it is necessary to strengthen the phlebotomist, and to take care of him in all these things.</start_of_turn>
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then the phlebotomist lays it down.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If ever an opening appears from the belly of the belly, then that is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat that vein again under that place slightly, or above it with a constriction: if the place does not yield
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	For if it yields, or the patient grows faint, then let him go on the first or second day: and do not tighten the ligament.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps then the clot will be drawn out by the drawing-out.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Neither should a poultice be introduced
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	For if the opening is small, or blood runs slowly: and take care that it does not go outside the blood quantity that you wish: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same place according to the rule, and add a little to the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do that with constriction, before the place yields, for the clot is often in many people in the surrounding area at the time of the operation itself
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you see that the clot has already gone, then do not repeat over it altogether, for that will not excuse you before God
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put over it something from the fat of oil: because it will soothe the running of the blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than pure oil, and than the rest of the oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And do the same with the fat of oil in all your phlebotomies, which you do against the running of the blood: and make that it be like tyriaca alfarach and sage, when it is put on one of them over the place
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	Blood thickens and resolves when it is gross.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	When blood is thick, it thickens and resolves itself
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has gone out of the vein itself, with its complement, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If anything black or yellow remains in the place after a few days, it does not harm: and if it does, place upon it some aloe, or balm of resolvers, or something of the juice of mint, that is, camomile or something like that.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And many times indeed are there apostemata and swellings at the phlebotomy of the basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Put your hand upon it therefore, then if you find softness in the compression of your hand over it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore put upon it something of what we have said
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps the blood will flow from that artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster of it with that which has astringency, so that the place may be bound up.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that you draw out of every man his blood according to the quantity of his virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the color of the stain on the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For blood is black when it is going out, then let it go out until it turns red: and in the same way if you see it thick, let it go out until it thickens: and in the same way if it is sharp, let it go out until the sharpness is gone
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	He who is full, strong, and in need of bloodletting should take one, so that the phlebotomy may be ample: and he who is bilious should be on the opposite side.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	He should draw it out in veins, and the opening should be tight: and it is better that it should be administered in the phlebotomy of the vein, than by puncture
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	This method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, and from the nerves: and it is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And he who has suffered from syncope during phlebotomy should before phlebotomy give the patient some bread soaked in pomegranate juice: or vinegar, if he is hot: and let him draw from the blood in three or four veins.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if the complexion is pale, then he should take before phlebotomy bread soaked in honey syrup, or in scented honey syrup with spices, or in scented syrup with a strong odor
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If there should be syncope during phlebotomy, and the cause of this is too much blood drawn: then he should take in the drink water with meat, and fragrant syrup under the tongue: and he should mix aromatic things with algae, and fill his chest with these: and he should do the rest of what we said in the chapter on syncope from evacuation
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wants to make his arm well, and to dissolve his blood in the second degree: he must take the one who has phlebotomy because of a great evacuation, and who is bilious, so that he may gradually dissolve the blood according to the quantity of bile in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Whoever wants to make his arm well, and to dissolve his blood in the second degree, and who is strong in his body: then let him do this after seven hours, or nine from his first phlebotomy
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it declines: it is necessary for him to do so on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it declines: it is necessary for him to do so on the second or third day.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it declines: it is necessary for him to do so on the second or third day.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it declines: it is necessary for him to do so on the second or third day
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it declines: it is necessary for him to do so on the second or third day
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it declines: it is necessary for him to do so on the second or third day
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it declines: it is necessary for him to do so on the second or third day.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it declines: it is necessary for him to do so on the second or third day
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it declines: it is necessary for him to do so on the second or third day
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it declines: it is necessary for him to do so on the second or third day
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is that it allows the sickly hand to immerse itself in warm water until the flesh reddens, and then the vein reappears manifest.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	And then it is bound over itself with a slight median constriction
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	And the phlebotomy is performed according to a cross-section gradually, not latitudinally, neither in length: and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be such that it is as little as possible over the joint of the hand
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If it is forbidden for blood to issue, then immerse the hand once more in the warm water, and allow the blood to flow in the water until you reach your need
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if you are in the summer days, then you are excused from the immersion of the hand in the warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And mostly blood flow in warm water is set in the wintertime.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all other veins, because there is no pulsating vein under it, neither nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Phlebotomy of the right hand of Salvatella is beneficial for the ailments of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is that you bind the hand with the ligature or your hand after you have immersed your hand in the warm water until the vein swells and appears to the touch.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	And the phlebotomy is performed by a cross-section
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut the vein completely, it will not cause any damage to it in any way
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And be careful not to lose your hand with the phlebotomy.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Under these nerves are exposed the nerves of the fingers denuded of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then again, move the hand to the warm water, and let the blood flow out into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	If you do not move the hand into the warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and will be prohibited from running.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you have drawn out the quantity of blood necessary, then put on the vein oil and salt: that it may not solidify too quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And in like manner it is necessary to make with every limb strict.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The dressing of a phlebotomy of the left hand is: because it is connected with the spleen: and in like manner do it in a phlebotomy of the right hand, as you did in the second equal to the first.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	As for the veins of the phlebotomy, the dressing is for the ailments which are in the lower part of the body, such as the ailments of the belly, and retention of the monthly blood, and weakness of the kidneys, and ulcers of the buttocks and of the ancient thighs, and similar ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is that it lets the sick foot enter the warm water: and makes on it friction above, until the veins become swollen: and ties above the joining of the foot with a bandage
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the veins are located at the heel, appearing under the thumb: and are pulled out from it on the face of the foot of many fingers.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	The phlebotomy is therefore better in a wider limb, or at the heel in its gathering: because it is better and safer
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If you do the phlebotomy on the face of the foot, then take care from the nerves which are under it over the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And put your phlebotomy as it comes out from across, like the one you wish to make: and be the phlebotomist Nestles
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If blood flow is prohibited, then repeat the foot in hot water: and allow the blood to cease its flow in the limb until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the vein has slipped from the first position, then repeat the procedure with phlebotomy above the lower part, for the place is safe and not liable to cause harm, as we have said
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	Similarly with the other foot's saphenous vein equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The veins of the sciatic nerve are located at the heel on the outside of the ankle
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	Its support in phlebotomy is for the pain of the ankle when it is caused by warm blood
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	Its quality is that it should include a diseased bath and must hurry: and tighten the limb from the ankle up to four fingers above the heel, with a fine thread that does not show except by this.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it appears, then phlebotomy must be performed as well as possible, or by displacement: and it is better either to cut the vein with a knife, or to ligate it by section
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For the place is safer, and it is hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it and do not perceive it at all: then phlebotomy should be performed on some branch of it, for it is that which appears in the back of the foot and below the heel: and cause the blood to flow out in the quantity you wish
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the tightening, and place over the place of phlebotomy the skin, and tighten the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	It heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	(The text continues with further instructions on wound care and treatment of various ailments.)
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 105.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	The sources of wounds are from bones, air, and blood vessels.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	The aetiology of wounds is in two ways
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	By incision and extraction of blood, or by contamination without incision
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	This contamination which is without incision is in two ways
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or with fire
Aut est absque igne.	Or without fire
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the wounds which are made with incision and extraction of blood are in fourteen parts of the body
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	These are the wounds which are made with incision and extraction of blood: Alnocrati is the most posterior wound of the head; Alkehel is the middle wound of the neck; Alhagdahim are two wounds of the neck from two parts at once; menti is under the mandible in the lower part of the mouth; the two wounds of the lips; Alachosos is over the end of the tail of the scapula; the two wounds of the elbows are in the middle of the two arms; the two wounds of the knees are in the middle of the two thighs; and the two wounds of the ankles are below the two calves
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	Wounds do not draw out blood from small scattered veins in the flesh, and for this reason does not cause the loss of blood like phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Neither is it necessary to administer wounds with fire, or without fire in any bodily illness which originates from congestion, until the whole body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	When necessity compels us to perform a wound for the purpose of treatment, or by custom, we must administer it at the beginning, middle, and end of the month, and at any other time as needed
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	When blood multiplies within a human being, until it requires extraction through incisions, it accumulates in the head, causing swelling and pain.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	It also results in swelling and redness of the face, head, and neck
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	It also causes itching of the face, forehead, eyebrows, and darkness under the eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And from this blood there results the place of incision for its extraction
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	From this blood laughter multiplies
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	From this blood there results a taste of blood in the mouth: either the tongue swells and expels blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	From this blood sleep multiplies
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	From this blood there results vomiting of blood, redness, and frothing, and similar things occur
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When we see this in the third part of the month, we order an incision to be made immediately, after two or three days have passed.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The ointment of the night is: because it itself contributes to swelling in the head, and what drips to the eyes
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	Therefore it is necessary that after the evacuation of the whole body
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	These are the wounds of cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	It is not permitted to perform this operation on those who are pale in complexion or in whom there is catarrh
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings great danger
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	Neither should it be performed on the elderly, in whom the head is cold and brittle
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	Whoever is very diligent beyond his limit will generate against himself an aversion.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	He must therefore take precautions, like the winds of the south, to throw his hand down with the lower part towards the ground, fearing the generation of aversion.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	The winds of the south or the Galen, is the place of the puncture of the veins of the Fusca, and the veins of the Basilica, and by this means he brings on asthma, constriction of the chest, swelling of the instruments, spitting, and distension.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	He must therefore take precautions like the winds of the Galen, which must be thrown down towards the lower parts, because if it is put below, it generates weakness in the chest and the stomach
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	The winds of the Galen cause pain in the head, vomiting, headache, perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and this is the place of the puncture of the veins of the Basilica.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	He must therefore take precautions like the winds of the south, do not bring your hand forward with the scarification: so that you do not cut the artery and cause the flow of blood to increase
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	The winds of the south under the chin cause swelling of the saliva in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar evils which are in the mouth: and this is the place of the puncture of the veins of the jaw, which are in two layers
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	The winds of the south cause spitting, which brings on vomiting, which is caused by reflection and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	The winds of the south cause the attraction of the inner parts of the two cavities towards the three veins, Basilica, Fusca, and Cephalic: because these veins attract blood from all these small veins that are in the flesh: and they attract these small veins from other large veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	It is necessary, therefore, that the surgeon take heed, not to perform too great a scarification: for in this place the flesh is stripped bare, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The winds which are blown upon the ulcers above the thighs cause hemorrhoids of the Ani and ulcers below.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	It is necessary, therefore, that the surgeon take heed, so that the winds may be great and open to the air: for in this place the skin requires strong suction, and the subtle winds may perhaps be broken by the scarification; and a great scarification is required
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	The winds of the thighs diminish somewhat in their manifestation: for they draw blood from the whole body, and cause ancient pains in the buttocks, thighs, and belly: they cause menstruation, and bring swelling, and stiffness: and they are in the place of two saphenous veins and the groin bone.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	Indeed, they weaken the body much, and cause syncope in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	The winds of the groin are close to the winds of the two thighs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The position of the winds is such that you should place the greatest suction at the first wound, and temper the suction: do not prolong the position of the wound, but place the hand quickly and remove it quickly, so that the humors may reach their place in an even manner: and do not cease doing this until the place is red and swollen, and the blood appears red: then indeed you may scarify, and perform the suction gradually
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Consider also the disposition of the body.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For one who has a thin body, little hair, should make the incision once, not more: so as not to damage the place
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And command the Wind-worker to increase the sharpness of the incision, and make it slight: and temper the suction to facilitate, and speed, and the movement of the blood.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is any thickness in the blood, it is necessary to make the incision twice.</start_of_turn>
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first incision, a narrow opening is made under the thickness of the blood, and its moisture is taken away: and in the second incision, the fine extraction of the thick blood is made.</start_of_turn>
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is dark or purulent, then a third incision is made: to achieve the most effective result.</start_of_turn
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	Finally, when we wish to extract the blood slowly or in small amounts, a single incision suffices.</start_of_turn
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	When we wish to extract a large amount of blood, we make multiple incisions.</start_of_turn>
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it is necessary to make a deep incision: and the equal end of the incision is the depth of the skin.</start_of_turn
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is to be done with the oils at the position of the Wind-workers, and what is their purpose?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In such a case where the skin is thick, hard, rough, and has close pores, it is necessary to anoint the area of the Wind-workers with opened, softened, and resolving oils: such as almond oil, or olive oil, or sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil.</start_of_turn
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or camomile oil, or mastic: and such like.</start_of_turn
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If the superfluousness is great, cold: then let olive oil be amaranth, or balsam oil or white oil, or anatine oil: and like these.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If the swelling is great, cold: then let olive oil be amaranth, or balsam oil or white oil, or anatine oil: and like these.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	If the swelling is great, cold: then let olive oil be amaranth, or balsam oil or white oil, or anatine oil: and like these
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	If the swelling is great, cold: then let olive oil be amaranth, or balsam oil or white oil, or anatine oil: and like these.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	If the swelling is great, cold: then let olive oil be amaranth, or balsam oil or white oil, or anatine oil: and like these
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	If the swelling is great, cold: then let olive oil be amaranth, or balsam oil or white oil, or anatine oil: and like these
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	If the swelling is great, cold: then let olive oil be amaranth, or balsam oil or white oil, or anatine oil: and like these.
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	If the swelling is great, cold: then let olive oil be amaranth, or balsam oil or white oil, or anatine oil: and like these
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	If the swelling is great, cold: then let olive oil be amaranth, or balsam oil or white oil, or anatine oil: and like these
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	If the swelling is great, cold: then let olive oil be amaranth, or balsam oil or white oil, or anatine oil: and like these
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And place the meat of the beast upon the wings of the dogs, and the birds: and the parrots, that is, the feathered wings: and the meat of the doves shall be placed upon the buttocks.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the liquid of the day of vomiting and bleeding should be more than the food: and it is necessary that it be given in liquid in some man in the hours of the Tyrian calf, or medicine of musk, that is, muskroot, or alehoof before vomiting: and before bleeding, or afterwards: in order to comfort the principal parts and temper the blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary that they take warm food in liquid.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	Of Vomiting without Scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	But those vomits which are without scarification are those which are placed upon the spleen, and the loin, and the heel, and upon the belly, the navel, and the place of the kidney: because these members do not suffer scarification over themselves
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not necessary to ask for ease, except for a pulling from a vein to a limb: as we place vomiting upon the nipples in the flux of blood of the nose
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we fear that the ice may make the vomiting cold and hurtful in the limb: as we place vomiting upon the belly and the navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	It itself dilates the limb, and warms it, and removes the pain thereby, because it resolves it
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed upon the kidneys, when it happens in ice-cold water, or urine.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	The urine perhaps opens the swelling, or eliminates the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And in the same way it does when it is placed upon the spleen and the loin alongside the vomiting in both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	The winds of the belly are administered with a section only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	When they are administered with fire as well.</start_of_turn>
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered with lukewarm water in the abscesses of phlegmas: and thus the wind of the belly is to be made great, only with lukewarm water alone, or with water in which herbs have been boiled that are suitable.</start_of_turn>
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of the wind of the belly when administered with fire.</start_of_turn
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	It shall be the breadth of two outstretched fingers wide, as we have formed it: and its quantity in depth shall be half a palm, and its lateral position shall be in the middle of it, at the small opening: let it be made of air alone, or of citrine, of coarse edges, soft, equal, fine: so that it does not harm the limb in its position above it: and there shall be a transverse bar of gut or iron in the middle, upon which is placed the candle with fire.</start_of_turn
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And thus this wind is made great, greater than we have said, and a little less than that, according to the abscesses and the age of the one who uses it.</start_of_turn>
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	The winds of children are different from those of young men, and those of old men.</start_of_turn
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of placing this wind with fire upon the limb is that you must kindle the tinder from the middle of the liniment, or a splinter from a candle: and place it upon the middle of the transverse bar which is in the middle of the wind: so that the fire is kindled around the lower part of the wind, so that the limb is not burned.</start_of_turn
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then put it upon the limb: and the finger shall be placed upon the small opening which I mentioned, until we have finished with the wind: when we have finished, we shall remove the finger, and the vapor will escape through that small opening, and the wind will be immediately cured.</start_of_turn
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then let the fire be kindled according to its manner, and repeat the process until the matter is digested.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In Ventosa, which is administered in the case of pleural effusion with water, there is neither a foreign body nor a hole: it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and is placed only on the part of the body affected
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	The larger the dose of Ventosa, the more water it will absorb, the better
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Of the suspension of blood-sugar.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter XCIX
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Blood-sugars are not administered in multiple parts, except in those parts of the body where the position of the intestines is not possible due to their density, such as the lip and the tongue, and things of a similar nature.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a limb stripped of flesh, such as the finger and the nose, and things of a similar nature
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of the powder is: as of blood-sugars which are in sweet waters, far from putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are discharged day and night in sweet water, until the pain has disappeared, and nothing remains of them in the belly
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is evacuated at first with a phlebotomy, and with a purge.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then cleanse the affected limb, until it turns red
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then apply something over it
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they have been placed and have fallen, and it is possible to suck out the place with a purge, then that is the best; and if not, then remove the place with vinegar
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then when water is much, and the wound is wet, and it is squeezed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	When the flow of blood is prolonged after the wound of the blood vessels, and that is that which is sweating: then pour on a linen cloth into cold water, and put it over it, until the sweating is stopped.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	When blood is multiplied, then powder over it charcoal, or lead, and things like that from the styptics: until the blood is stopped.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or put over the place middle things of scraped bark: and they are released, until the cloths adhere to the place, for the blood is stopped.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if necessary to repeat the bleeding, when it is possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if bleeding is prohibited from suspension, then the place is washed out with blood fresh
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or hold the point in the places, until something comes out of the blood
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then put on it, for when they feel something out of the blood, they adhere immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you wish that they fall, powder over them something out of burnt aloe, or salt, or ash: and they fall immediately
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	End of the Second Part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	Book of Surgery by Albucasis, Part III.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	Universal discourse on restoration, dislocation, and treatment of torsion, and similar things.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also very necessary in the art of Medicine, and is the restoration of fracture, and dislocation of the accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Listen, my sons, for those who speak of this Chapter carelessly of the doctors and the fools, and who have never read any of the ancient books, and who have not learned from them by heart.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	Because of this, it is like this that this method is hidden among our learned men.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	I have never learned of anything like this from anyone before, and I am not skilled in this regard. However, I have learned it from the great books of the ancients, and from studying their intellect, until I was able to extract this science from their pages.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Therefore, I have adhered to experiment and the length of my life in this matter
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And I have described all of this for you in this chapter concerning the science which I have mentioned: and beyond the experiment which I have mentioned, after I had abbreviated it for you, I have published it from my laborious work on the subject, and I have abbreviated it in order to abbreviate it, and I have declared that in order to decline it: and I have formed in it various forms of the instruments which are administered in this case, as well as by adding the decline, as I did in the two preceding chapters
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	In summary, and collection of the essence of bone fractures, from which the preparation is necessary before we begin the remembrance of fractured limbs and their various forms, if any.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary, as we say in the prologue to this chapter, to summarize the discourse and chapters which precede this one, in order that those who are attentive and those who are prompt may know, or learn, or add to this noble art, and that others may depart from you
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when anything happens to a man, whether a fracture, dislocation, twisting, or any other mishap: then it is necessary immediately to attend to draining him and resolving him, or both at the same time: if nothing hinders, such as the weakness of the spirit: or because of some other infirmity, such as a young man or an old decrepit person: or because of the time of the year, or the heat or cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content with his food, with cold herbs, and with birds' flesh, and blood-vessels: and let him abstain from drink, and from fatty meats, and restore himself from food and from all food which fills the veins.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	When he is secure from the heat of the after-meal, and does not fear an effusion of the material to the limb, then let the patient return to his first regimen as soon as he can with the habit which is accustomed to him.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the fracture of the bone is beginning to recover, then it is necessary that the patient should eat nourishing foods in great quantity, solid and fatty, in which there is viscosity: such as barley bread cooked with water, and barley meal, and heads, and feet, and entrails of cocks, and fish, and fresh eggs: and strong wine, and things like these
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	With this regimen the coagulation of the fracture is made more rapid and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that broken bones, when they are in the parts which are in their first old age, and decrepit, it is not possible that they should continue and consolidate according to their natural course, because of the drying up of the parts: and they consolidate and continue only what is in the end of softness, like bones that are in their infancy
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	But nature adds upon the broken bone from every side something like glue, in which is thickness, wherewith it adheres and binds it, until it is consolidated into one, and is bound into one, until it comes in the end to fortitude and firmness, like it was in the beginning, until it is not hindered by any of its operations: and for this reason it is necessary that you should give the patient nourishing food which contains coarseness, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the species of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of the parts: for as the fracture of the leg is diverse from the fracture of the head: and the fracture of the breast is diverse from the fracture of the back: and in the same way all the other members are diverse one from another: and I come with the recollection of the exposure of each species of fracture mentioned in his book distinguished from the others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	Diverse are the kinds of fracture of a bone even within itself.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For the bone fracture is crooked, besides that it happens in the marrow
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	When it happens in the length of the bone: there are fractures of the bone with displacement, that is, as in the marrow, as in a pen, when a knife is applied to write.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	Not from outside: but from a wound and disruption at the head: and it is a small fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And in every kind there is an ingenuity, or its own instrument for restoration, according to which the recollection of its matter will be distinguished in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	From which it is known that a fracture of a bone is its crookedness, and its prominence: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you press on it with your hand
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore no crookedness appears in the place, neither is there any sound under your touch when you touch the bone with agitation, neither does a great pain appear: then it is not a fracture, but it is possible that it is a crookedness or a small fracture: it is not necessary therefore to move the limb completely with the hand and to compress it entirely, but rather to place above it a physician who knows the remedy, after which the stricture will be tied with a fine string
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you know that when a bone is crooked and breaks into two, besides that it happens in the marrow: truly all the parts are moved from their place: then you must immediately start to rectify it from the very beginning, equalizing it before any callus forms on it
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if a callus has already formed on it, then defer it for a few days, until the callus has rested
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equal it with the like according to whatever method you like from lenity and ingenuity.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	You also know that the restoration of it and its equalization are easier than bones in which wounds have occurred from cuts.</start_of_turn>
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it up according to what you remember of its nature.</start_of_turn>
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If, however, there are cuts in the bone, then extension of this fractured limb from two parts is necessary: if it is the hand, or the foot: or with the hand, if it is a small limb: or with two strings, or with a strap and a hand.</start_of_turn
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such as you place the limb in a place equal to its figure, natural to it, until when the parts of the fractured limb are extended: then try to bring back their additions with all your ingenuity, and according to whatever method you can in their places: and be careful according to your strength, lest you cause greater pain or damage through your operation than before, and try according to your strength that you may apply one of the two bones with its partner, according to better forms.</start_of_turn
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary in this hour to try and touch your hand.</start_of_turn
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If there is anything diverse there, correct it and equal it with the quantity of your skill.</start_of_turn
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And be careful of excessive extension and compression, as many soliders do.</start_of_turn
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	Many of them indeed cause this to happen through their surgery after the swelling has gone down, or contraction in the limb: as we have seen this happen from their surgeries many times.</start_of_turn
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then bind up after equalization, and calm the operation, and strengthen that limb, and rest, and tranquility: and take care of the infirm person over that.</start_of_turn
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him lie down, that he move not in the hour of his sleeplessness, and that he rest his sleep at its revolution, and that he rest his agitation, and at his evacuation, and all his movements lastly with his will.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And let him lie so that his limbs be not in a position which follows pain
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	For when he feels pain in a position of a limb, or an injury: then it is necessary to change it to another position from that in which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And make him lie so that his position be equal and straight: that no stiffness should arise in his limb when he is restored
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the fracture of the limb is known by me
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You know that fractured limbs are diverse in their parts, in their magnitude, and in their form.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	As for the small ones, such as the arm, the finger, the heel, and things like them, then it is necessary to apply soft dressing, fine.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	As for the large ones, such as the thigh and the leg, it is necessary to apply a wide and hard dressing
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the broad ligament connects the great limb and tightens it from all parts equally, so that it does not bulge out.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	And then after you have evacuated it, from the equilibrium put on a bandage that is convenient for this, on the swelling above the fractured place
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	And then bind the ligament above the fractured place three or four times, according to what is necessary for the limb: and hold the hand firmly with the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then draw over with it to the upper part beyond the fractured place, and tighten less than the tightening you made at the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then draw over with it to the upper part beyond the fractured place, and soften the tightening gradually, until you have restored the great part of the limb to its natural position.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take hold of it again and draw it over the fractured place once more with more sutures.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then draw over with it to the lower part beyond the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the tightening of the suture and the softening of it, as we mentioned in the first upper suture
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then put between the sutures some soft material, or a cloth, with which the fracture is even; or if there is no twist in it, do not put anything in it
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then draw over the first suture again.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then make the other sutures even over the two sutures already made as soon as they are finished, if there is no swelling or hardness in the place.</start_of_turn>
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	But if there is swelling or hardness in that place: then put on that which sits over that hardness, and remove the swelling: and keep it quiet for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tighten over it once more the sutures which you have made
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the sutures be of moderate width, neither too thick nor too thin, formed with skill: or they may be of wood from which cribra are made, or of willow shoots, or ramis palmae, or nails: and let the width of every suture be according to this form, and have the same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	It is indeed necessary that the suture which is placed over the tract should be thicker and wider than the rest of the sutures: and the length of the suture should be according to the size and position of the limb
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then string over Astellas with another, according to the first stricture.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind above with strings as before, according to what has been said concerning the stricture: and that is, that the stricture should be greater over the place of the fracture: and the more distant from the fracture the stricture is, the smaller it should be
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that there be medium-sized and soft threads between the strictures.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are large, like the intestines from the cutting of solid bodies, it is a great error: for the stricture will fall from the bowels of the cord that is twisted.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And fine threads are again not suitable: for you do not follow through with the stricture with that which you wish
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not right that there should be less than a finger between the Astellas.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	For if the patient is injured between the Astellas after the stricture in healthy places: then put under the bowels from the staple a soft cushion, or carded wool, until nothing is injured from that
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When however there is a fracture with a wound, and a disruption has occurred in the skin, I will speak of it in the second chapter concerning the singularity
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And you know that not every fractured limb needs to be strung with Astellas from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	For when the limb is large, it is not necessary to string it with Astellas immediately, but after five or seven or more days, according to your security concerning the after-effects of the heat
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the way of plastering which the ancient people used to restore fractures and dislocations.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The common method of applying the plaster is to restore a fracture, suitable for various physical types, especially women and children: because neither heat nor cold hinders its effect.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	Take from the flour of wheat a moderate quantity, and let the barley straw which hangs in the belly of the mill remain in the mill: and make it as much as possible, without making it thick or thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it as desired.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another method of applying the plaster is to restore a fracture, dislocation or twist
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Honey, laudanum, acacia, enula, mugath: and wine, all together 10 myrrh, and aloes 5 and alethil 20 are measured out, and pounded, and mixed with warm water: or with albumin if the patient's complexion is hot
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is a good composition, restores fractured bones quickly, and is suitable for many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of applying the plaster, which also strengthens fractures and twists
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Mugath, mess, white alum, all together 10 myrrh, and aloes 5 acacia 6 pounds of barley and 20 parts of vinegar are measured out, pounded together with many other ingredients, and pounded, and made with water, or with albumin.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	Method of applying the plaster for joints, and bones separated from their places: and it will soothe the pain of an accident, and cut the scissura of the bone, and the fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take flaxseed, and soak it in vinegar, and dip it in decocted oil: and put it on the place
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	Neither in this plaster is there any restoration, but it is good in calming the after-effects of a hot abscess: and it drives away pain on its own.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	The plaster does not restore the fracture, but is good in calming the after-effects of a hot abscess: and it drives away pain on its own.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take coarse leaves of fennel and leaves of sycamore fig: and mix them all together, and make plaster from both of them.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	The plaster is abbreviated for administration in the restoration of the fracture of a bone: and when you desire the resolution of the remaining after-effects of an abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Recipe for the root of artemisia, and chamomile, and flowers of violets, and barley flour, take one part each: mix them all together, and boil them with wine, if the limb is not warmed
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If the limb is warmed, then mix it with wet coriander water, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another plaster that is stronger for the resolution, than the first one, when there is a hard abscess at the restoration of the limb
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recipe for the root of artemisia, and flaxseed, and barley, and honey, and sesame, and violets, and chamomile, take one part each: mix them all together, and boil them with salt water, or with sweet water, or with wine
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	The whole thing according to the heat of the limb, and the quietness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates himself did not say in his book that anything should be placed upon the fractured limb during its restoration, except for lead or wax: nothing else. He says that there should be a medium between the thickness and thinness
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 Galen, however, thinks it is useful to place upon the fractured limb during its restoration things which are excretors of heat, such as myrrh, and aloes and incense, and things of that kind
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The manner of applying the plaster which pertains to the lesion and the pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	A mixture of honey, wax, hair of a man's teeth, or feathers of a bird, alum, and salt, in equal parts: they are pounded, crushed, and formed together: and from this is made the plaster.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity, however, according to what is needed, so that the bandage remains intact, then it is dissolved, that is to say, as you see, if it does not happen to the sick person that he feels no pain, neither itching, neither movement of the fractured bone from its place: then do not dissolve it for many days.</start_of_turn>
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If it happens to him in the place of itching or pain, or swelling: then it must be remedied, and dissolve it in an hour, and remove the plaster from it: and take a soft bandage, or a sponge of marine linen, softened: and immerse it in warm water, and remove it with it from the place, until the itching ceases, and the pain is gone.</start_of_turn>
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then put upon it dry wool, immersed in vinegar and oil, or oil of roses: and bind it over it at night once, until you are secure from a hot afterbirth, and the swelling of the limb is quietened, and the pain is removed.</start_of_turn
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat it to a slight tightening, and a little plaster: and do not bind it too tightly at the first, but gradually with it, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	When you see that the swelling, the redness, the pain, and all the other accidents have passed away, and that the plaster and the tightening are unnecessary, then repeat it in the same way as you did at the beginning equally.</start_of_turn>
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If the limb has not recovered anything from the ailment we mentioned within three, four, five or seven days, do not treat it any further.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	When the whole limb has recovered within twenty days, as appears from the resolution of the limb, as we have mentioned, until the fracture has united and the blood-clotting has approximated over the bone: then add further support to the limb beyond the first stricture you put on it: and also add further restriction of food for the sick person, as before remembering the convalescence of the limb.</start_of_turn>
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If, however, the place of the fracture has already disappeared and the limb has been stretched more than is necessary: then you know that nutrition must be withheld from it.</start_of_turn>
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Treat the limb with lukewarm water at every change of the dressing and keep it in this way for three days, and reduce the stricture slightly.</start_of_turn>
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	By this treatment, the limb will quickly recover its nourishment and heal more quickly.</start_of_turn>
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	What those who restore fractured limbs often do with the limb is not right at first, but afterwards according to the necessity: this is an error in their operation, and a great fear: for if it should be right, the ancients have said so in their books, and they have operated with it.</start_of_turn
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	I have never seen anyone do this in this way, and it is right to avoid doing it.</start_of_turn
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	From the injury of the head.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.</start_of_turn>
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	There are various kinds of fractures, and their figures are numerous: and their causes are diverse.</start_of_turn
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For from a fracture is that which is made by percussion with a hand: and percussion raises the whole bone until it reaches the marrow, which is under the bone, as does an axe in wood: and for this reason this kind of fracture is called Axialis.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or a hand strikes something of the bone, and strikes its face, and does not penetrate to the end of it: and this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, Complete fracture
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there are two kinds of fractures, or a great one, or a small one.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And a fracture is a break, or crack: and its cause is percussion with a stone, or falling from a height, or something similar.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also penetrating, which approaches the marrow, which is under the bone: or it is in the face of the bone: and this is a wound of both these kinds of fractures, whether great or small
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And a fracture is also hidden in the bone in the subtlety of a hair: and it is a small break, and for this reason this kind of fracture is called Capillaris.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And a wound is a fracture which is made by a case, or by percussion of a stone, or things of a similar kind, which makes the inner part of the bone split, and makes a concavity: as it happens with bubbles of air when there is percussion of things, and some of them enter the inside
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And most of all this happens in the heads of soft bones, as are the heads of children
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these kinds of fractures are separated by a fracture of the bone, and I will remind you of all of them in their place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these kinds of fractures by their location on the surface, and by their touch, and by the excision of corrupt tissue that is on them
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The hair-growth on the scalp is recognized by this [instrument], as it is detected on the bone, is plucked out, and is bound upon itself with cautery: a fracture thus appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, first consider the signs of the infirmity: when these signs signify a serious condition over fear, such as vomiting of bile, swelling, loss of consciousness, vomiting of blood, fainting, and acute fever, and discharge of urine, redness of the skin, and similar symptoms in various positions, it is unlikely that it will recover: if you do not treat the serious signs, and hope for recovery, then begin the treatment of it.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	If a wound comes to you at first with the wound: and if this is in the cold days, then it is necessary that you should study in the elimination of bone from the fourteenth day following every position
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	If it is in the summer days, then it is necessary that you should speed up the removal of the bone before the seventh day before it is corrupted which is under the skin from the cartilage, and these are the accidents which we have mentioned
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If a fracture of the bone has gone right up to the cartilage touching the brain, and is with small pieces, and attraction: then it is necessary that you should cut away the fractured part and the attached part, according to what I have told you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is fitting that you should grasp the head of the wounded person: and detect on the bone according to whatever way is possible for you: and according to the figure of the wound, and what lies above the infirmity.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If there should happen to be a flow of blood from the bone, or a soft swelling: then oppose it with that which is necessary
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is fitting that you should place the area with soaked sponges in wine, and wet plaster: and make the wound quiet, until the swelling subsides, and be secure from the flow of blood
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then commence with the treatment of the bone, and its excision.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	It is done according to two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	The first method is as follows: you cut the bone with a straight chisel and a keen edge: this is its form.</start_of_turn>
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then you apply another chisel after the wider one has gone past: this is its form.</start_of_turn>
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then you also apply a wider chisel than the last one.</start_of_turn
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	The second method is as follows: you have several chisels of different widths: some are wider than others, and some are narrower than others: and they are at the ends of the chisels, and they are made of iron or steel: and use the ease in striking over the chisel, so that it does not break the head and damages it.</start_of_turn>
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If the bone is strong and hard: then it is necessary to perforate its circumference before you apply the chisels, with needles which are called non-penetrating needles: and they are not called thus except when they do not penetrate the end of the bone which is covered with flesh to that extent: because the needle is a rounded extremity above that which is under the acute head, like a margin, and a small circle prevents it from submerging, and from penetrating the thickness of the bone.</start_of_turn
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting that you take many of these needles, the number of which will be equal to the thickness of the bone, until it is present throughout the circumference of the bone: the quantity of the acute extremity of the needle in length and width is equal to the quantity of the thickness of that circumference.</start_of_turn
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of the three species of needles, or trephines.</start_of_turn
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of the perforation in the circumference of a fractured bone is: to place the thumb over the bone and move it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then move the thumb to another place and place something between every hole as much as the quantity of the radius, or around that
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then with the incisor between every hole of the bone: make it finer than the thickness of the limb from its end, as we have said, until you have pierced the bone, or your hand, or something else which you are using for this purpose, such as tweezers or fine forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary to beware of every caution, that you do not touch the thumb or the cutting instrument with anything.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have completed the perforation of the bone and it is separated from the surrounding tissue, if it is still connected to something, you must remove it and join the ends together with something like an instrument similar to the incisor
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it must be thin and fine like other incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If anything small remains of the bones and soft parts: grasp them easily with the help of what is beside you among your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound afterwards according to the rules and unguents which we have mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of operation is easy, especially far from fear: which Galenus said and praised highly: and this is his saying.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is not necessary at first to remove the fractured part of the bone from the place where the fracture is most prominent and obvious: until you have recognized that part and placed under it the tip of this lens-shaped incisor which has this shape
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the blunt part of the lens does not yield anything: and the acute part of it extends in its two flanks as far as its length, like water: so that the blunt part of the lens is close to the sac, its acute part being incident on the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	And thus pierce through the Incisorium from one side with a small hammer, until you have cleft the whole bone easily, as it is turned over: and you will be safe from the fracture, which does not happen in this accident, which you fear beforehand.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And even if the physician is not stupid among men, and is more ignorant than them, or if he is asleep, then if anything remains attached to the bone from the fracture in some place, he will cut it away from that with the extremity of the lens itself, and will deliver it easily from that
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It is delivered from that without any damage, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate the sac, and that which is broken off from the bone is its surface, and remains in the same with its roughness and slight elevations: then it is necessary to remove that roughness, and grind away those elevations with fine files of various sizes, so that it is possible to administer from them in every place where it is convenient, and to make them straight again, according to what is necessary for the operation, and for the fractured bone and its figure
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And you must administer with your reason, that in the first place you should make the files wider than those of the bone.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	And then use the finer ones afterwards.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease doing this until you have reached the point of administering the finest and most delicate of them all
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	And in every small opening or slight fracture of the bone, where the fracture is delicate, you must take care, according to what is necessary for its rectification.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	It is a thing which is not hidden over all, concerning which in this art there is anything to be studied, and which stands over that which we have written, and which we shall demonstrate in great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If, however, a swelling has been detected to remain when the bone is fractured: then it is necessary that you take hold of the swelling with a bandage, according to the quantity of the wound, and immerse it in oil of roses, and place it over the wound opening.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another bandage, either doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and oil of roses, and place it over the first bandage: and make it as easy as possible for him to bear it, so that it does not cause him to shiver
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer above it a broad ligament: and do not tighten it, except for the quantity which will suffice to hold the wound only: and let it go when it has healed for one or two days, until it is secure from the heat of the after-pain.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then heal it, and afterwards administer such medicines as are useful for excessive moisture: such as the roots of lilies, and herbs of barley, and the dust of thorn, and belladonna, and the like of these: and it is necessary that you make from these medicines a powder, which will be scattered over the wound like dry things.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And generally administer in that all medicine which has the property of drying, and does not bite
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And take care according to your skill, so that the wound be limp in your care: neither soft nor dry, neither moist nor dry.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Neither let the moisture gather in that altogether: for when the moisture gathers on the swelling of the brain, it corrupts it, and putsrefies it, and brings about great harm afterwards: and this happens in the case of the head, when it is neglected, blackens on its surface because of it.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Consider therefore at this time, if any accidents befall a patient which we have mentioned, you know that it is perilous to linger far from the patient.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	If it does not happen, unless there is a medicine which is placed upon him, and it is in the benefit of that medicine that it should happen: then it is necessary, that you take from the honey a portion one, from the rose-hip a third, and lines like those of a bandage
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it upon the wound: afterwards take care of it with the species of cure which are suitable, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	When the restoration of the nose is fractured.
Caput IIII.	Chapter III
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You know that the nose is not fractured except for two of its upper parts together, or one of them: because they are two bones: for the lower one of them is cartilaginous, it is not fractured, and it does not happen to it except for attrition, and twisting, and similarities
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts is fractured, then it is necessary that you introduce the little finger into the opening of the nose, and equal the fracture with your index finger and thumb, until the nose returns to its natural shape: and do this with art, with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware, that you do not cause additional pain to the patient by your operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and it does not reach the tip: then it is necessary that you equal the extremities of the radius, where there is little thickness
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If however the fracture is in both parts: do the same: and keep the restoration of the first day of the fracture.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	If not, then after the seventh or tenth day from the setting of the wound
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	If there is a fracture in one part of the nose, insert one clip; if in two parts, insert two clips. Make the clips as large as possible, so that they may obstruct the nose.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	Some of the ancient restorers say that they pour the clips into butter, and change them every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	It is not seen by me that this is useful; it is better to pour the clips into flour or meal, and mix them with fine powder of the mill
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then remove the clip when the bone has healed, and insert cartilage.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	When you insert the clip into the nose in the place of the licinum penna, after covering it with a soft pad: and it makes that the nose itself holds the fracture more firmly, and that it does not prevent the patient from breathing
Et non est haec res necessaria.	This is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do this; if you wish, do the clips.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If the nose happens again while you are working after the operation, plaster the nose with gypsum, or with fat smeared on the wax, or with some of the ointment from the diaquilon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	But if it does not happen after the operation, then it is necessary to plaster it with fine flour mixed with poppyseed and meal made with barley flour and butter
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then put on the soft pad, and do not bind the nose with anything whatsoever
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If the bones of the nose are fractured by a small fracture or split, or if they are comminuted, then it is necessary to break through them with instruments and extract them themselves
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then cut through, and care for it with that which is appropriate, and consolidate with the things that are useful for this, or with unguents.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If a wound occurs between the nose and the ear, then it is necessary to administer lead ointment and apply a lead tube until the wound heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	In the restoration of the lower jaw when it is fractured
Caput V.	Regarding the restoration of the lower jaw when it is fractured
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is fractured and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound: look then if the fracture is only from the outside and not broken into two parts, and that it is healed inwards: in this case its knowledge is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	It is necessary therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, to insert the left index finger into the bone: similarly if the fracture is on the left side, then insert the right index finger: and press with it the swelling of the fracture inwards until it is even with the surrounding parts of the bone
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jaw has already been separated into two parts, then it is necessary to administer an extension from both parts, according to the straight line: until it is possible to equalize it
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If however a displacement or fracture should happen in the teeth: then string those which you hope to keep with a thread of gold, silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then put over the fractured jaw a plaster cast.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then put over it a doubled pad, and put over the pad a large sponge made hollow: or a piece of skin of the sole of the foot equal in length to the jaw
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it up above, according to what is prepared for its ligation, and agree to its application, until it is not destroyed: and command the patient to rest quietly: and give him food of soft consistency
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If, however, you think that something has altered with regard to some figure or mode: then be proper and solve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	If therefore it has been altered from that which it was, mend it again from the meal, with alum or with ground barley, after you have removed the tumor: and put over the dressing a soft wool blanket.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While that dressing remains attached to it, and the disposition of the bone does not change, leave it alone, do not solve it, until it is healed: or bind the fracture
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	It is bound up many times in seven days.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If in the meantime a proud swelling should arise, then manage it as we have said many times in its mitigation, until that swelling is removed
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	If the fracture is with a wound, consider it carefully
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	For if the bone is fractured from the flesh, or from the socket: then be attentive in this matter, so that you may restore the flesh of the fracture to the bone with that which is appropriate for the evacuation of these instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If indeed the opening of the wound is narrow: then enlarge it with a lancet according to the quantity of necessity.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed the fracture, and there is nothing remaining of the bone, seal the wound, if it is large: or put over it such patches as are appropriate for it, and bind it, until it is healed
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the furcula when it is fractured.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Indeed the furcula is most often fractured from the anterior part towards the humerus, and the fracture of it is done in two thirds of the way
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or else it breaks and separates into two, besides that they happen in their sitting: and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or else, because they happen in their sitting: and it is more difficult to restore it.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or else, because of fracture with wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in this case when the fracture is without wound, that is, you make two assistants present, that one hold the fractured fragment, and the other extend the limb over the part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equalize the fracture of your fingers, until it forms like this, according to what is necessary: and let it not be prominent, neither hollow
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	Which if it does not suffice by extension, then it is necessary, that you put under the thumb of the patient a sphere of cloth or wool: and let the size of it be according to the quantity of necessity: and extend and lift the fracture, and cover the sphere of the hand, until the fracture is equal, according to what is necessary
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	Which if you are not able to draw out the extremity of the fracture to the outside: because it has gone deep: then it is necessary, that the patient recline over his cushion: and put under his arm the middle finger of his hand in magnitude, and bring the minister of the arm to the lower part, until you elevate the bone of the fracture which is in the depth up to the surface: and then straighten the fracture, and equalize the fingers of your hands.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	But if you feel swelling from the fracture, and movement: then it is necessary, that you find over that, and extract it easily.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	But if it is retained in the bone, then think in incision of it with one of your surgical instruments which you have prepared for this, after you have placed under the fracture an instrument which will retain the blood: and it is an instrument of wood, or of iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	The shape of this is like that of a cockle shell which has no cavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	Its width is such as that which is equal to the breadth of the bone from which it is taken, and its height is such as that which is equal to its breadth
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length is also such as that which is possible for you in the operation
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	It has two extremities like a pair of tongs: one extremity is wide, and the other is narrow
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If however the rupture of the wound which you cut when you extracted the sathayatum of the bone is wide, secure it from the surrounding tissue with a hot cautery: then join the two lips of the wound with sutures.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	If the rupture is small, or there is a little bleeding: then close the wound with stitches and sponges according to the quantity of the wound
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If there is bleeding, then pour in rose-water, aceto, wine and oil above it
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The structure of the bone when there is no wound and no section, is as if you put on the bone a plaster made of ground wheat with barley or almonds
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And put on a soft cushion above it
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then put a sphere under its head if you think it is necessary
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a bandage, which is the kind which the Saracens use, which is long and wide: and its width is like the palm of one hand, or somewhat less
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then put on two layers of wool over the cushion and the plaster
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a bandage from a thin board whose width is equal to three fingers, and in length somewhat similar
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then soak the wound in the cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then soak the wound in the cloth with the stars in the place of the injury that falls over the fracture and the place of the break
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then put the dressing over the fracture as if to roll it up, and soak the cloth over the head of the limb and under the healthy nail and under the unhealthy nail: and reduce the cloth over every part, and as much as the surrounding structure allows the fracture to relax: and that is that which is not hidden over you, and all, so that the star does not fall from the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason it is necessary to wash the wound every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Every time therefore the ligament is softened, and the star is removed from it: then make it straight again, and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then put the patient to sleep on their back, and put under their nail near their sleep the small nails of the night, so that when they rise up, they will support their helper from their side
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	The fracture of the collarbone is elevated by the elevation of the arm
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind the arm to the limb: and do not relax the ligament, if it does not happen in the place of the accident from the itching, or from the swelling, until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the dressing, if you have washed its face to that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add in the structure, and let it go, until it is restored and coagulates again.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fracture of the collarbone is bound and comforted according to many people in eighty days: and when it is in some people in less time.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	¶ On the restoration of the fracture of the collarbone.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	Rarely does the spatula break; and in its wide place: and they do not break from that side of the margins of it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore it breaks from that place, and breaks in the middle of it, and is not known except by touch: then according to the figure of the fracture to try its preparation
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it above the natural figure in every way of skill, which is possible.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then put upon the place the flour of barley with alum, and a soft poultice, and put on top of it a little piece of cloth doubled.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then put on the top a wide bandage from a thin board according to the quantity of the spatula, or a little more.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If indeed under the bandage is a concavity in some place of the spatula, then equalize that concavity with a soft poultice, until the bandage descends according to equality
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind up above with long strips of aloes, gentle tightening, and firmness of the bandage, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligament in every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Every time therefore it is softened, bind it up, and equalize the bandage if it moves from its place: and let the patient lie upon his sound side
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula is restored in ninety days, or in ninety-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When therefore this number is completed, then loosen the ligament: and you will be secure.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from the bones whose connection does not fear time, neither is its solution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however it proceeds from a bone that is fractured under the skin, then you must cut above it and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	Do as we have said concerning the fracture of a bone from the loosening of the posterior process of the calvarium, if anything should happen from this.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the breastbone.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.</start_of_turn>
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breastbone sometimes fractures in the middle, and this is rare.</start_of_turn>
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	The extremities of it (the breastbone) are most often fractured and broken by its accidents.</start_of_turn
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When it fractures in the middle, which inclines towards the lower parts, and pain, difficulty in swallowing, and coughing result: and perhaps blood is omitted, and displacement of the fractured bone is discerned by the sense. The restoration of it is that the infirm person be put back upon his back: and put between the two spatulas put in the pulp.</start_of_turn
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press down the humeri (upper arms) and bind the ribs from two parts or from two sides with hands: and smooth out its shape, according to every possible way and to what is convenient, until the figure of the bone is restored, according to what is necessary.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then put upon it a dressing and a pad, and place above it a small star made of a thin board of cypress, or of lead, or of something similar in lightness, after you have bound up the wound in cloth.</start_of_turn
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then smooth out the binding of the wound above the fractured bone, so that it does not move: and keep it with a bandage that is round about the back of the body, and tighten it loosely.</start_of_turn
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Consider the ligature at all times, and whenever it is softened, tighten it: and if its necessity compels its solution at the site of purulent discharge, or corrosion which occurs in the place, or pain, or swelling: then remedy it, and solve it, and remove the dressing, and rectify what has occurred in the manner of its treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Remove the dressing if it is to the face: and bind it tightly, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	In the restoration of fractures, when they are fractured.</start_of_turn>
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.</start_of_turn
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You know that a fracture of the Costarum does not occur except in great places which follow the backbone, and from the extremities of them from the anterior part.</start_of_turn
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not occur except by chance, because they are cartilaginous.</start_of_turn
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And its knowledge is not hidden from sense in its investigation with the fingers.</start_of_turn
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done in such a way that it equals the fracture with the fingers according to the possible mode, until the figure is equal, according to what is necessary.</start_of_turn
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then bandage it, and bind the fractured bone with a pin if necessary.</start_of_turn
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the Costarum is sloping inwards: then there occurs with it weak pain which endures, and swelling, like that which occurs in a wound which has pleura: because the bone pierces the lung, and there also occurs with it difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and blood-stained urine: and this is a difficult cure.</start_of_turn>
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients were learned in this with many crafts: and among them are those who say that you should place under the limb of the sick man some substances which generate inflammation and swelling, so that the belly inflates, and expands, and drives the fracture outwards.</start_of_turn
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We must indeed avoid that there be any casual connection between the making of the incision and the occurrence of swelling.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If, however, it should happen, then it is added to this.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some say: let us place over the swelling a compress, then draw it out with force, for it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	Indeed, time will tell that it attracts swelling to the place by the arrangement of the tissues.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some say: it must be so that the place should cooperate with the wool which is immersed in hot fat: and we will put in between the ribs some wool until it is firm: so that there will be an even ligation when we bind up the wound according to its circumference
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the sick man is cured by food and medicine for pleurisis.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If, however, we bind up the sick man too tightly, what he cannot tolerate, and the bone is punctured with a pointed instrument, and we fear over the sick man: then we must split open over the place and remove the fractured rib
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we put over this an instrument which maintains the bowels, whose memory precedes it: and we break the bone easily, and break the bone itself.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we will gather together two lips of the wound, if it is large with suture: and we will treat it with compresses until it is healed.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If, however, swelling should happen in the meantime, then be careful, and pour some powdered wool over the fat and put over it: and treat the sick man with this which is suitable for the swelling
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	He also rests on the side upon which he sleeps until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	Of the restoration of fractures of the rib and neck bones.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Bones of the neck sometimes accompany fracture, and rarely happens without attrition: and similarly with the bones of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When this occurs to anyone, and you know whether he is healed or not: then keep silence.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For indeed if you touch his hand, when it is softened, stupefied and dead: neither can you move it, nor extend it, nor constrict it: and when you do constrict it with your fingers and nails, when you touch it with an awl, he does not feel any pain: then you know that he will not be healed, and that death is at hand
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	When he moves it and feels constriction in it with your fingers and needle: then you know that the bone is not fractured, and that he will be healed with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If also with the bones of the back it is like this, and you know whether he is healed or not: then look at his feet: then if you see that they are softened and that this happens in the hands: then when he lies over his back, the swelling and discharge go out without his will: and when he lies over his belly, the discharge goes out without his will: and when he lies over his back and wants to drink, and he cannot: then you know that it is deadly
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	It is not in vain that you labour in his cure.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If indeed nothing else happens to him from this, things are easier for him.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And his treatment from this is that you apply a warm compress after the fracture: thus, when you put on the splinter of lead on the bone which is drawn towards the bone, alone: or with some sponges or wool soaked in oil.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Put over it again and again every day until the swelling has subsided: then put on one of the cushions mentioned above, and bind up the other with a bandage: and command the patient to rest quietly and peacefully
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	Sleep not over the part where pain is found, until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If it happens at a fracture of a bone, or anything that is separated from its place: then it is necessary to strip over the skin, and elevate it
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	And then join together two lips of the wound, if it is large, with sutures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	And then care for it with some nourishment, from unguents, until it is healed
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If indeed the bone of the heel has fractured, and the end of the bone is towards the heel: then it is necessary to insert the little finger of the left hand into the hole, and equalize the fractured bone, as much as is possible, and with the other hand.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place above it, and lift it up: and care for the wound with the care which preceded it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	Of the restoration of the ankle
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Rarely do bones of the ankle fracture
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they fracture, then the fracture of them is not, except for a comminution at the extremities: and they are split in length, and lean inwards: and there is severe pain in the place, and swelling: and the leg which fractures is stiffened
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it, until you are over the fracture as well as its figure
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at the extremities: then equalize it, according as it is prepared for you, until its figure is restored to its natural state
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If however the fracture is in length, or leans inwards: then make the patient lie upon his belly, until the restoration of the fracture is prepared
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have equalized the surrounding area, place above it a patch: then place above it a star of wood or skin: and tighten the surrounding structure more than you fear the displacement of the fracture, nor the removal of the star.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	When you have equalized the swelling of these with that which is to be bound, do not cease binding until the surrounding area has attained an equal level: and command the patient to rest upon his back or side, facing upwards
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if there should happen to be a hard swelling: then cease from the extension of the limb, and restore it to its original position, until the hard swelling has subsided: and place above it what has subsided, as before, and tighten it as seems appropriate.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If indeed it has happened in the bone that it has fractured, or is broken, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured bone.
Caput XII.	This is the twelfth chapter concerning restoration of a fractured bone
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The assistant is that which is from the elbow down to the head of the scapula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If indeed it has fractured, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	The first of these is: take a plane piece of wood of middle thickness, according to this shape which follows
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two ligatures are bound at the two extremities
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is suspended from a raised place: and the patient sits upon it
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he throws his fractured arm over the wood, until it reaches the level of its elbow, in which there is a bundle of nerves
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then suspend from above something heavy, in order to extend it to the lower parts
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician must set the fracture with his own hands until it heals, as required.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is that the patient should rest upon his bed: and suspend his hand from his neck with a ligament.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two attendants, that one should hold that which is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other should hold the lower part, and extend each of them to their own part
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish, that the extension should be stronger, then string under the fracture with a ligament, and above with another ligament: and extend each of them by two attendants to their two parts
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is close to the elbow, then it is necessary to put on one ligament under the olecranon and another under the fracture towards the cubitus
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And in the same way if the fracture is close to the elbow: then it is necessary to put on a ligament above the place and above the cubitus itself
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then keep the fracture still with ease without work, until the fracture is equal according to what is required, and apply a good application: then string it if the swelling has not subsided
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If indeed swelling has subsided, then loosen the tightening until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place above it a soaked bandage in vinegar and rose oil, until the swelling has subsided: then string it. And the method of stringing is that you place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a covering of new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then fix the arm over the aid, and put the hand open over the arm.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a pad, and bind over the aid-arm, so that the arm rests in the place of the nails: if it does not prevent you from doing anything else, do not alter anything over you from a fractured bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If anything is altered over you from a fractured bone, then use nails: that is, place over the fracture the nail which is broader and stronger than the others.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between every nail a breadth of a finger: and let the length of the nails be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers from every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	And bind over the nails tightly as I said at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is, that your binding over the fracture should be tighter
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	The longer the fracture is, the tighter the binding should be
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you have placed the nails and binding as we have said, when you restore the limb immediately, do this: and if there is swelling, remove the binding and nails until the seventh day, as we have said
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament in all three days, that it does not happen in the place of itching, or swelling, or that it should be prevented food from passing to the limb, because of the arrangement of the excess binding.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Do this therefore completely, as we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If however you are over confident, that nothing will happen: do not loosen the ligament, except after three days, or more
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient rest on his back, and his hand on his stomach: and put under the aid-arm a full pad of wool equally
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at all times of the night or day, that the fractured limb is not loosened, or the ligament is not softened
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Straighten out all that is crooked in your wound.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And place food for the patient according to the order we have prescribed, so that the food is soft at first, until the bone starts to knit: then it is necessary to reduce the food again.</start_of_turn>
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	In the case of a wound of the thigh or knee, it is necessary to keep it bound for forty days: then it is necessary to loosen the binding and apply a poultice, and to administer unguents which will straighten out the wound.</start_of_turn>
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If there is a fracture in the wound, the edges must be approximated: then do not dissolve the ligament and the fragments for fifty days, and until two months.</start_of_turn>
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	Regarding the restoration of a fractured bone of the arm.</start_of_turn
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.</start_of_turn>
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The bone of the arm is composed of two bones, which are named the two heads.</start_of_turn
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of them is the forearm: and that which follows the thumb.</start_of_turn
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is the upper one, and that which is placed under the forearm from the lower part.</start_of_turn
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore the larger head is fractured alone, or the forearm: or both together.</start_of_turn
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the upper head of the forearm is fractured, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is more favourable.</start_of_turn
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower head is fractured, the fracture is bad, and the healing is difficult.</start_of_turn
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when both bones are fractured together.</start_of_turn
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If any bone which is fractured lies somewhat above the socket, the doctor must be present at its restoration, in order that he may place the extension of the socket with ease, until it be equal to itself.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If indeed the fracture is large: then it is necessary to place a stronger dressing above
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	It is necessary to place the hand in its original position at the restoration of the limb, and to extend the extension above the joints.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	The thumb should be placed above the fingers, and the lower joint should be placed over the rest of the fingers or their remnants: and the limb should be placed sitting squarely on its own, with the palm facing outwards or directly above it, in elevation, so that the limb does not suffer from excessive tension.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then extend the limb from the lower part, or by means of the hand or with the ligament.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And the other limb extends in the same way from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the doctor must equalize the bone until it is reduced to a better position than before
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are protrusions in the fracture of the bone, then attempt to reduce everything to its place by your means
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If indeed there appears to be a separated fracture, and the skin is torn, and there is no hope of restoring it: then find above it, and remove it according to the method which we have mentioned above.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If however the fracture is with a wound, I have made for this the separate head, therefore take charge of the cure from here on.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If indeed at the beginning of your restoration you find the bone callous: then stretch the skin with a rough cloth made of rose oil, and white earth, and keep the middle between the thickness and thinness: and bind the skin over it with a fine dressing, until when the bone is set: then remove the cloth and place an ointment prepared from pounded barley with white of egg.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place sponges, and let the sponge which is placed over the fracture be wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of sponges for the arm is six in various positions: if the fracture is in one cavity, or in two cavities together
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place a strong dressing over the fracture, more firm and tight, and somewhat more with the dressing above the fracture, or below it: or place a softer dressing under the former dressing, as the case may be remembered at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths that cover the fracture be soft, moist: and not hard, rough
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread which is tied from the linen be medium between fine and coarse, as we have narrated.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and the ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	For if anything happens requiring rectification, such as itching which occurs in the limb: then it is necessary to bathe the limb with warm water, until the itching ceases, and then loosen the limb, until it rests, and then repeat the dressing
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the dressing is now softened, and the bone is now removed, and things are like these: then rectify all this with your might, and consider again
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if the nourishment is hindered from reaching the limb, because of the excess of the dressing, then it is necessary to soften it somewhat, and remove it for a few days, until the nourishment reaches it, and then bind it again
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if no harm befalls the sick person anything of what we have said, then it is not necessary to dissolve it, except after eighty days, or thereabouts.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the hand of the patient is suspended at his collar.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	The collar should be even, and the patient's body should be protected from any violent movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	Let him sleep on his back
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	Know that this fracture will heal in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and it may possibly heal in eighty days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All this is in accordance with the temperaments of the complexion and the virtue of the patient.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	On the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 123.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fractures of the bones of the hand and the knuckles of the fingers are rare.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	They do not happen to them except from great attrition
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When such a fracture does happen to the palm of the hand, or to the attrition: then it is necessary that the patient sit square: and before him be placed a seat even with the ground
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then put his hand over his extended forearm
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	And extend his fractured bones, and the doctor must keep them even until the junction is restored to its natural condition
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary to place a plaster and a bandage, if there is no swelling
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	And put a support above in accordance with the quantity of the place: and I am covering the hand in linen cloth
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If however the fracture is near the lower part of the palm of the hand, then make like a sphere of linen: and command the patient to rest his hand over his fractured bone: then bind with long linen cloth
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the stars be excised from the skin, where there is softness, so that the skin may be applied to the root of the plant: and string them up, according as it is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	And if the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary: that you place the star above and the star below in the root: and let the hand be open straight
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then put on a bandage, as it is turned: and extend between the fingers with the ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	And if it happens that the fracture is of any of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it is equal according as it is necessary
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	And string it up with the root: and if there is swelling, put upon it a straight star, firm: so that the fracture is elevated and does not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	And if the fracture is of the remaining fingers, such as the middle, and index, or ring, and little, then it is equal, and it is bound up with the healthy finger which follows it: or they are bound up altogether: and that is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or put upon it a second star firm, as we said concerning the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in the restoration of it, and after the application of the warm compress: and oppose with it what is necessary, when anything of this happens, according as its narration is repeated.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	Of the restoration of the fracture of the thigh bone.
Caput XV.	(The provided text does not include the content of Chapter 15, so I am unable to translate it.)
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The thigh bone is fractured in many places, and is declared by sense: because it is turned towards the inside and the outside parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done thus, that the ligament above the fracture is strung up, and the ligament below the fracture is strung up.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the sickly man returns over his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then extend all the ligaments around the part to its side in accordance with equality: and this is when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If however the fracture is close to the root of the coxae, then let the ligament be at the part of the pelvis, so that the extension rests above: and let the other ligament be under the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And thus in the same way if there is a fracture close to the knee, then let the ligament be close to the knee, so that the extension rests below
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the doctor must unite the two bones with his hands, until he has reduced it according to the likeness of a natural figure: and he must join the bones with a good suture
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to put on a dressing and a bandage, if it does not happen spontaneously to the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	And if it happens in this way spontaneously: then let it be left for a few days, until the swelling subsides, then return to your care.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The tightening of it must be like this
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to cover over the fracture with a strong bandage, that is, a bandage: and to bind it twice or thrice: and to leave out of this excess
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then bind the limb, until the heel reaches the root of the nail
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And introduce a long thread between the coxae and the limb near the knee towards the lower parts, and lead the extremities of the thread from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	And roll over the limb and the coxae what was superfluous from the rest.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	And put over the coxae in the place of the fracture itself little cushions, and put over them a single cushion on the bone of the thigh
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill up the spaces between the knee and the hip with soft cloths, so as to equalize the tension.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then commence from the middle above the fractured area with three or four layers of bandage
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	The longer you extend beyond the fractured area, the smaller and softer your tension should be
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then go to the two extremities of the thread which you have introduced between the hip and the knee.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Tie it thus with three knots on each side.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then pull down with two threads of the thread to the bottom, until you reach the heel of the foot
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And when you have bound both threads of the thread from the other side: so that the ligament does not slip from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then release the tension above it, while it remains, so that it does not cause bending of the limb, swelling, or inflation, or similar things
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	Which if these things happen.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Thus also with the solution of the problem, and correct that which happened earlier, as we said many times before
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If there is a projection from the bone which is causing pain: then it is necessary to equalize it, if this is possible
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find over that, and remove it: and care for it with that which went before, until it is healed
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture of the hip is bound, besides the addition of bandages, as we said in the treatise and the arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	But in the restoration of it like this fracture, no stiffness should occur
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides what is applied to the other limb, then it is necessary that the limb which is always closed must close.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the coxae are strung out in fifty days, or are added a little, or diminished a little: all this is according to the difference of temperaments, and the remaining conditions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the knee-joint
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that the knee-joint rarely suffers from fracture, but it frequently suffers from multiple abrasions.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If however it does suffer from fracture, then it is not without a split or a hole in its parts
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And this is with a wound, and without a wound
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And remains over this whole thing with sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is thus, that it be made equal to what was disrupted from its parts with the fingers, until it is joined together, and united according to what is possible from equality and facility, and fabrication.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place a plaster of meal from wheat or barley, with egg white or glue: and place upon it a round cushion, if you please: and bind up from above with a suitable bandage
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the conditions which we have narrated in the other fractures: thus as the swelling of the limb, and similar things: thus, that you oppose all accidents with what is convenient for it, until it is healed
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the leg
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the leg has two bones, of which one is thick and is called the Cruris: and the other is thin and is called the Focile
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	Both bones of the forearm fractured in the same way as when two bones of the arm fracture: and because of this, its restoration is made in the same way as that of the arm, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If two bones break together, the limb curves toward all sides
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	If a small bone breaks, the limb curves toward the front part
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	If a thick bone breaks, its fracture is found beneath: and this is from that which does not appear on the surface of the limb
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then perform extension, and equalization, and ligation of the ligaments according to that which is equal
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the limb is bad, having many wrinkles: in this case the extension must be small and the relief must be gentle
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the limb there is something from the operation which surpasses the arm: and that is, when you have equaled the bones and completed all your work, then grasp two boards of pine, which are administered in the making of sandals that are placed under the boards: and they are made from the palm leaves: choose from those which have a small thickness, and let them not be from the smallest: and let their length be according to the length of the limb from the knee downwards
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then bind over one and a half turns with two bands according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And put one part of the limb from one side, and the other from the other side: and let them be from the knee downwards to the foot
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind two bands in three places from two extremities and middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	When the binding is finished, the limb bends to the right and left, and remains in a good position
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And immediately thereafter, it is administered to him a cubulum of wood according to the length of the Cruris, and it is placed in that Cruris, so as to preserve it from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And it is for the most part necessary, that thou do this in the fracture when it is with its own bone.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the Cruris every day, and study with care its latest from apostemate, or inflation, or anything else.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If anything happens of these things to it, then oppose to it with what is necessary, until it be healed, if God wills it.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of the fracture of the bones of the Foot and Fingers.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	The Calcaneus never happens to be fractured through
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	The bones of the Foot indeed happen to be fractured sometimes, and the Fingers little also; and it does not happen to them except through attrition in many positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If it happens that the bones of the Foot are fractured, and thou dost wish to elevate that bone above the other, then thou dost place the sick Foot upon the earth prepared as a walker
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand thou, and place thy Foot upon that which thou dost elevate from those bones: afterwards press, or touch the heel: and keep it even, until it returns to its place
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then place a dressing, and bind it up: and place under the Foot a board having two flat heads
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind up the Foot with a tight bandage, after thou hast enclosed it with cloths and the like things
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When three or four days have passed, or four, then loosen the ligamentum
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	Your hand finds bones equally whole, whether they are fractured or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation therefore lies in the bone, just as with water
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If, however, any finger is fractured, then restore the limb and equalize them as I have said in the restoration of the fingers of the hand
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place your finger upon the support, according to the length of the finger: make it wider than the other. Then place under the foot the board that I have mentioned above, and tighten the bandage with a descending knot.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If, however, two, or three, or more bones are fractured, then place upon each finger a support of its own quantity, enclosed in linen: and tighten the board under the foot: and place one head of the board outside the foot so that it will hold the retention well
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you to remember that you must consider all that I have said concerning the other fractures from which I have spoken: and oppose every accident with that which is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Concerning the fracture of the forearm of a woman, and the bones of the forearm of a man, and the swelling of a woman.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the forearm of a woman is fractured, then make her sit in a square position.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her hand towards the back of her shoulder, and support it behind her
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the midwife take hold of her forearm, until she grasps it: and make the forearm like a sphere from this
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then bind the woman, and lift her back gradually
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	This will cause the swelling to go down, until the fractured bone returns to its place
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then put the poullain on his back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When he wants to eat, remove the swelling with ease, then let him eat: and reduce it according to the way in which you introduced it at the beginning. Then return to his poullain first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Do this for seven days, or thereabouts, and the swelling will restore itself
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a saffron poullain and string it over the opening of the wound with a rush of Arundis, and introduce the whole saffron into the cavity of his wound
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the cannula with force until the saffron fills the cavity of the wound, and the fracture will return
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then it is done with the swelling, and let it rest for a few days, as we have said, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the Pectus breaks, whether in a man or a woman, then administer in the restoration of its equilibrium, and the same as we have said concerning the bone of the Anchae
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And do not conceal the rectum in its nearby fractures, which happen rarely, especially in those who have something to study or who are learned.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book well, for the fracture itself signifies to you in many circumstances the right way to restore and strengthen itself: understand therefore.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	In the twig of a man when it breaks, grasp the tongue of the lizard: and introduce the lizard into itself.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then put upon it a covering of linen cloth, and cover it, and let it rest for three days, or thereabouts, and it will heal, God willing
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	Concerning the restoration of fractures of bones when there is an ulcer
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is suitable for him on whom it has happened that a fracture has occurred with a wound, especially if it is great, as for example the bones of the thigh or the ribs or the like of them, that he should be immediately given support, and that a bloodletting should be performed: if these conditions of bloodletting are attested to.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If blood flows from the wound, then it is necessary to support the wound so that the edges are drawn together: so that the blood is powdered over the surrounding area: if nothing else is present
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on the same day: and do not delay this, if there is no sign of swelling.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed swelling occurs, then defer the restoration until the ninth day, until the swelling has subsided.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach him on the third or fourth day, for you will cause him to suffer further pain.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If however the fractured bone is prominent above the surface of the skin, then it is necessary to reduce it and equalize it with your hands with ease and slight extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If he is not prepared for extension of his limb, and its equalization with your hands: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And the instrument is made of iron, the length of seven fingers, or eight: and the width according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for this reason it is necessary for the physician to take from him three, or four according to the quantity that is required for the care of every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round: and let its size be small, so that it does not double under compression in the hour of operation: and let its sharp edges be blunted at the extremities, which have a margin at their extremities
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And above it to the breadth from the middle to the lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.</start_of_turn>
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in the operation that one should place the acute edge of the instrument curved over the prominence of the bone: and drive it in with the thumb until the bone returns to its original position and is equal on all sides.</start_of_turn>
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore to make equal the extremities of the fracture inwards.</start_of_turn
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If its extremities are slightly fractured and do not grip the instrument well, then one can cut off a small piece of that bone until the instrument can hold it.</start_of_turn
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If indeed it is not possible to reduce them as we have said before, then cut it with the knife which we mentioned earlier: or saw it with a saw in any way possible.</start_of_turn>
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then grind that which remains of the bone from its asperities and small chips.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone has been reduced, and when it has been found that the limb after reduction still feels pain, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.</start_of_turn
Fac ergo illud.	Do this.</start_of_turn>
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer great pain on the patient when you complete your restoration of the bone.</start_of_turn
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse the limb in wine vinegar, black.</start_of_turn
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And indeed if it is in summer.</start_of_turn
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place upon the wound a greasy dressing, nor anything containing oil: so that it does not cause the wound to become infected and corrupt.</start_of_turn
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then manage the stars at the hour of completion of your restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	Discharge the wound: thus, that you may cut with scissors a hole in the swelling according to the quantity of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	Be cautious and take care, lest you tighten the wound with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Many have done this carelessly, and they have caused their patients to become lame or to die, or corrosion, or suppuration, that is, illness.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your treatment be soft, gentle, diverse in the strictures of the remaining fractures
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is bad, or is large, or the time is great of some other mishap which we have mentioned, and if you find pain in the suspended part: then it is not fitting that you should put upon it stars (stitches).
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	Make for it incisions from tough papers in the place of the stitches, and string it with thread.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When however it is after one or two days, and the wound has begun to swell, so that pus is generated in it: then take away the paper which you put upon it with the wine
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then manage the plaster, and ointment as is customary with us, in order to heal the wound: such as ointment of belladonna, and the like
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	It is convenient for you to dissolve the ligament.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	Consider the wound every day in the morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the limb be prepared in this way, so that the pus comes out from under with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If the wound passes many days, and is not consolidated, neither does the pus depart from it: then you know that there is an injury of the small bones there
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Why should one inquire about a wound with tentacles?
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of these tentacles are separated from the wound, remove them and extract them themselves.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And what remains of these is not separated, and penetrates the limb, and causes pain, attempt to cut them out, and remove them in every way possible for you
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If it happens that a wound is swollen or blackened, that is, bruising, or any other corruption or decay: then it is necessary to oppose each of these things with that which is appropriate for its cure, of which mention has been made in its chapter
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And concerning that in which it is necessary to state my opinion, and to which you should pay attention when a bone is fractured, and it protrudes above the limb, like the thigh bone, and its attendants, and similar things to large limbs, that you should not presume its attraction, for much harm often arises from this, even to the point of letting go of it, until it decays
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps indeed it falls away by itself after eighty days, or a hundred.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then indeed care for the wound if you see it: and otherwise, let it go
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	Note: The provided text does not include any information regarding the care of nodation in a fractured bone, so I am unable to translate this segment.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.</start_of_turn>
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	Many times this nodulation occurs in the healing of a fracture.</start_of_turn
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially that which is close to the joints: and is caused by that figure of the limb.</start_of_turn
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps hinders the limb from its natural operation.</start_of_turn
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Consider therefore at this time, if swelling is present: administer in it medicines which have styptic properties, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar things.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Consider therefore at this time, if swelling is present: administer in it medicines which have styptic properties, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar things.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	Consider therefore at this time, if swelling is present: administer in it medicines which have styptic properties, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar things. And loosen the stricture, do not keep it tight for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	And then loosen the stricture, and repeat it until the swelling is gone.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or tighten over the middle of the leaden plate
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	Lead has the property of removing everything that threatens the limbs
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If, however, the swelling has already penetrated the stone, and is tightly closed, and produces pain: then find above the said part of it, and cut off the superabundance: or break the swelling with some instruments, until it is removed: and take care of the wound, until it has healed
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	And as for the care when the limb has been restored, and remains under the skin, not according to its natural order: do not neglect it, but keep it under control.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When the fracture of a bone has been restored, and remains under the skin, weak: then it is not done except for great causes
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Such as the multitude of solution of the ligament and its ligation which is not according to what is necessary: or because of the excessive tension of the ligaments, until the nutrition of the limb is hindered: or because of the excessive amount of superfluous embrocation which is not in its proper time: or because of the scarcity of blood in the body of the patient, and its weakness
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And its care is to nourish the sick person and strengthen the body, until the blood multiplies in it.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and gladness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place plaster on the limb: so that it attracts much nourishment to itself
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And diligently anoint it with warm water, until the nourishment has recovered and returned to its natural shape
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	When restoring fractured bones, care for the restoration of the curve
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When the limb has been restored after healing, after a fracture, and the bone has protruded, or there is a bulge: and it is being made to bend by that shape of the limb, although the limb is not forbidden from its natural action: then it is not necessary to break the limb again
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there are many sturdy doctors and restorers of limbs in our land who have done this thing.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is very dangerous, bringing about death or great fear, as indeed it is mortal
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the swelling and bulge are recent: then it is necessary to anoint with warm water, in which decoctions of soothing herbs are boiled, such as rue leaves, and the root of it, and honey, and the like of these
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And make for him a plaster with a soothing plaster, such as gypsum made in the center
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or take the mucus of rue root, and mix it with pork fat, or fat from fish: and plaster it with that.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	The ficus of the belly swells, and it is to be treated with colocynth seed and other substances which the physicians call for in order to diminish consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	When the swelling has gone down with repeated rubbing, as is done with wet hands, the old and soft adhesion will disappear.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	Motion of the limb is administered at every part at all times
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If, however, a swelling has preceded the stiffness, and has become strong, and has become converted to stone, and has proceeded to necessitate its cutting: then it is necessary to cut above it, to dissolve the continuation of the bone, and to remove what is superfluous from the adhesion or from the bone with fine forceps: and this must be done with care and attention
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	Regarding the dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the displacement of any articulation from its normal place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Because it hinders its motion and deforms the limb
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And causes great pain and wounds that bleed.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When, therefore, any dislocation has happened, then it is necessary to hasten its restoration: and do it without delay
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place is stiffened and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation will become more difficult.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore it is not to be moved or extended at the time of its restoration
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because it causes many spasms and painful sensations
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when this has happened, then it is necessary to perform phlebotomy on the patient.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be discharged, until the swelling subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then let the limb be bound with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then let it be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And care for all the limb with that which its memory will return to its place
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I command you to order the head of dislocation, also according to what has preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body down to the lower part of it.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Concerning the care of dislocation of the lower jaw
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	Rarely do two mandibles dislocate except for a little while.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both is done according to one of two methods
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they are moved from their places with slight removal, and they are softened gently
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated completely, that is, until they reach the middle of the breast, until the soft parts are softened, and it is not able to hold itself, neither is it able to close its own bone, and the tongue is involved with the speech
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When however the dislocation is slight, then it returns by itself in several positions with little exertion
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If however the dislocation is complete, entire: then it is necessary that it be managed immediately, and not be delayed: and it is necessary that the minister of the patient keep hold of the thumb of his hand with one hand at the root of the dislocation of the mandible between its bones, if the dislocation is from one side
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he introduces two fingers of his hand together, if the dislocation is from both sides
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining fingers of his hand are outside, equal.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And command the patient to loosen his teeth, and clench them towards the biting portions
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	The physician must equal the jaw, and push the jaw until it returns to its place
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are together: then administer an evaporation with warm water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy: and do not attempt to reduce them both at once, as we have said
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they have returned and are equal, and the patient's jaw is closed, and not softened: then place over the teeth of the patient, with wool which has been made from wax: and wet butter.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	And it is bound with ease with soft bands.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the patient sleep on his back: and his head is placed between two cushions, so that he does not move his head to the right and left: neither force him, nor cause him to chew anything: but rather put a soft food in his mouth, until when he moves his pain has ceased, and the jaw has settled: then he may eat what he wants, and that is given with ease
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He does not work on the operation of his mouth during eating and drinking, and chewing, until the jaw has settled and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of both jaws is difficult, when they are dislocated at some time, and do not return to their places: then many times there follow from this fever, and bitter soda: and perhaps the patient's belly becomes relaxed, and perhaps bile is omitted pure
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When you have done thus: then you know that it is lost, and many times he dies from it in ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the reduction of dislocation of the Furcula and the extremity of the humerus.
Caput XXVI.	On the reduction of dislocation of the Furcula and the extremity of the humerus.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The Furcula does not dislocate from the inside outwards, because of its continuation with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	It dislocates sometimes outwards: and this is recognized by sense.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its reduction is that the patient lies with the sore side upwards, and extends his arms
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then cover the place with your hand and with a strong bandage, for it will return by itself
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place over it a bandage, and sponges, and bind them tightly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities following the elbow do not dislocate with it, except rarely
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it dislocates on some other day: then it must be reduced and equated as we have said, and which is prepared for you
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place over it a bandage, and sponges, and bind them tightly
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And command the patient to adhere to tranquility and quiet, until he is healed
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And when the extremity of the humerus is reduced thus, when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	And on the reduction of dislocation of the humerus
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the humerus does not dislocate, except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	The first is that it dislocates to the lower part of the elbow
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is that it dislocates to the part of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is displaced to the upper part of the Humerus: and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it does not move to the back, because of the spatheum.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it does not move to the front, because of the nerves
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And most often it is displaced and comes down to the lower part towards the armpit: especially in those in whom the flesh is little
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	For it comes out in flesh quickly and enters quickly
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	In those in whom the flesh is much, it is contrary to this, for it comes out with difficulty and enters with difficulty
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some people by blow or falling, and the Humerus is displaced by a hot swelling, and it is thought because of this that it is displaced
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	It is necessary therefore to experience this until you are certain of its extent, and then you may proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	It is recognized that it is displaced when it comes down towards the armpit: and you must distinguish between a displaced Humerus and a sound one
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will find among them a manifest difference, and you will find in the head of the Humerus a concavity, and under the armpit at the touch of the head of the Humerus as though it were a bone: and it is not possible to reduce the limb with the hand at the wrist, nor to move it in any way.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is displaced towards the chest, or upwards: then you will find a clear sensation, neither hidden
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And in such a displacement there is a simple reduction when it is recent, or when the limb is weak
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is that it elevates the minister's hand to the upper parts.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under the nail of his thumb, and elevate the joint with strength upwards to its place: and the minister will elevate his hand and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then place the lower part below, itself returning quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If however it does not return by that which we have said, and it has been displaced from the beginning for several days: then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water, and that an embolus be administered which softens and soothes, like those which are extracted from elder roots, and rue, and meadowsweet in water, and an embolus be administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the patient is laid on his back: and under his thumb a sphere and wool are placed, which should be equal between softness and tension.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician places his heel on the sphere, and elevates the upper arm with force, and attracts the patient's hand downwards
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another minister holds the patient's head, so that it does not move downwards: himself returning immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: and it is that you make the strong hand which is longer than the patient's hand to stand at the side, and insert the arm under the thumb of the patient: and elevate the thumb to the upper parts, until the patient is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another minister grasps the patient's hand downwards towards his belly
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If however the patient is limp: then it is necessary that he be suspended with something else, so that it relaxes him: for it returns quickly.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced in another way: that it appears like a long stick which is embedded in the earth, with a rounded head: like the sleeve of a shroud: for it is neither thick nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then it is placed under the lower part after the upper part of the stick has been covered with soft wool: and the lower part remains fixed according to the length of the stick
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then extend the hand downwards from the other side, and extend the body downwards from the other side with force: for the suture returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If its reduction is difficult by all that we have said, then take care of it thus: take a stick whose length is equal to the distance of two arms, and whose width is equal to the distance of four fingers, and whose thickness is equal to the distance of two fingers: and let its head be rounded, so that it may fill the opening downwards to the bottom of the wound, according to this shape
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then bind on the rounded head of the stick soft wool, so that it does not harm the wounded limb.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then place under the wound the lower part of the limb, so that the hand or arm extends over the stick down to the lower part: and bind the stick to the aid and the hand and the extremity of the hand
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then place the arm over the step of the ladder for the width, and extend the hand downwards, and let the rest of the body hang loose from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The suture enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When it has therefore completed its passage through it in whatever way is possible: then it is necessary to place under the wound a sphere equal in quantity from wool
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then put on a prepared dressing of ground flour with oil, and white of egg over the whole arm, as it is turned outwards
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tighten the string under the nipple: and restore the ligament above the swelling: and connect its hand to the neck of itself, and let it go, neither move its hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	It is necessary to give the patient food, until the limb is comfortable: because it is quicker for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then put on a larger dressing after seven days, or five, and keep it until movement returns.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If it is firm and does not soften, then it is healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If the ligature has been displaced many times, because of the moisture which has happened to it, or for another cause: then it is necessary to administer cautery with three holes, according to what is stated in the chapter on cautery
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If you do all this, and the ligament is dissolved after seven days, and the ligature is not confirmed, and the swelling and stricture above it are reduced, and it does not firm, and it falls off, and it is not possible to elevate it to the upper parts: then you know that the nerves which are at the head of the humerus are cut, or extended, or softened: and you know that the ligature has never been fixed in its place
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	As for a dislocation which happens towards the breast and the nipple, or backwards, it is reduced by impulse and extension with the hands: until it returns, and the remaining stricture and care are administered until it is healed
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If after healing there is still a degree of stiffness in the limb, and tardiness in its movement: then the patient is bathed many times, until the stiffness is softened, and it returns to its natural state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	(The text following this section is not included in the request and is therefore not translated.)
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the dislocation of the cubital bone is difficult, and returns with difficulty: and it dislocates to all parts, especially forward or backward.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	Its dislocation is not concealed: because it hangs down under the skin and under the touch, according to whatever position it is dislocated in
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated cubital bone with the sound one, it is declared to be firm
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	The join must be firm, and the arm must not be doubled over, nor touched with the other arm
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary to act promptly, and reduce the dislocation immediately, before swelling occurs
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if swelling occurs, its reduction becomes difficult: and it may not heal at all, especially if it is at the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	There is great pain of all kinds of dislocations, and of fear of it: and it descends with great violence.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration when it is possible to reduce it, is that you extend your hand with both hands: and extend your arm, and place the hands of the physician above the elbow and under it, and he himself drives the join together with his thumbs together, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or else the dislocation is forward: then it returns so that you bend your hand with your hand, until it touches with the root of your palm the dislocated cubital bone
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If it does not yield to reduction, then administer strong extension, force: and that you extend the arm with two assistants: and they must hold it still even when extending
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is returned to its entirety after it has been encompassed over the hand by a doubled long bandage or a wide ligament.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	When the doctor grasps the hand with his grasp, let him moisten it with oil: that it may be from that which assists in the lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he drives the grasp forward with force until it returns
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it is necessary to place upon it a compress where there is styptic action and drying with alum: and it should be bound firmly enough.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	The arm should be suspended from the collar of the bed: and let it rest for a few days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it will be cured.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If the joint remains closed in its place, then solve the ligament from it and let it go
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if the joint is not well bound, then repeat the compress and the ligament, and let it rest for a few days until it is bound
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then it will be cured
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If, however, there should happen to him a great degree of pain after the reduction of the joint, and the limb be stiff: then give lubrication in the bath, and gentle friction, and compression, until the pain subsides, or place over the joint a poultice, that is, a piece of fat from a sheep's belly
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it is bound, and let it rest upon the bed day and night
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then take away the bandage, and put it into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When it is wet, then gently friction the joint.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat upon it oil once, twice, and thrice with the entrance of the bath, until it is softened
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	If necessary, place above the rectum a cushion filled with fat, moist and warmed with butter, and bind over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	If necessary. Place above the rectum a cushion filled with fat, moist and warmed with butter, and bind over it.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	It itself [the cushion] will soften, and returns to its original position.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	From the treatment of dislocation of Almahassem.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The limb of Mahassem is much displaced, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand is dislocated
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of this dislocation is easy
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Contrary to the rest of the joints
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	Indeed it is necessary to take care that the speed of reduction of this dislocation does not exceed the hour in which it was displaced, before the place is set: or else it will happen in that setting a callous fracture.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of this dislocation is like this: place the lower limb of Mahassem on a board and extend the hand: and the physician puts his palm on the prominence of the joint and urges it until it returns
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	Indeed it is necessary to take care, if the palm should slip inside the limb: then the infirm person puts the back of his hand on the board at the extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then let the position of the hand be inside the board, that is, the inner part of the hand is placed on the board, so that the physician's hand rests on the prominence of the joint itself
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If therefore it returns immediately, that is good: and if not, then bind the limb with a dressing while it is at rest: and let it go, and do not attempt it again
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	If he does not tolerate it, neither can the flesh above the reduction remain firm after a few days: for truly the joint will remain joined according to its nature. And it does not harm the patient anything, except that the hand is softened, and nothing can be bound: then you know that the nerves are cut, or injured.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is no wit in that, except that it be bound with cautery near the case of it
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	Perhaps it does not matter at all.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When the Almahassem does not return, then put upon it a dressing as we have said.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then bind it, and let it remain for five days: afterwards loosen it and let it go, and exercise the hand.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If however its motion be retarded, and anything weighty occur in it: then soften it with warm water and gentle friction until it is softened
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	(End of excerpt
Caput XXX.	(Chapter 30.)
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When the Digit is dislocated from its place towards the whole of its part, or from the palm of the hand towards the wrist, or from the bone towards the wrist: then extend the Digit and drive out the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the Digit, and suspend it against the part from which it is dislocated, and let it go in two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it, and extend it, until it is straight on that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When night comes, bind it as we have said: and do not cease to loosen it daily: and exercise it with motion: and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do that for a few days until it is strung together.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	Do the same with it for a few days until it is joined together.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	Do the same with it for a few days until it is connected together again.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	Do the same for a few days until it is strung together.
Caput XXXI.	Do the same for a few days until it is connected together again.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to anyone's neck or back, or a displacement of many vertebrae from their places: then it is not in that case necessary to do anything, for the poison is sufficient for the sick man.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And a sign of that is that the patient's limbs depart from him without his will, and that he cannot hold them together: and many times they soften some limb of him, or two arms or two legs, or one of his members: or they move a vertebra from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	Many times they move it because many times the removal is made from four sides
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	That which is moved to the back is called gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment of that is, that he should rest in bed until the gibbosity has happened from infancy: then there is no healing from that at all
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in whatever case it happens, whether by chance, or by blow, or in any similar way, as the ancients said in their long discourse on the modes of treatment.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which the greatest part does not return when it has gone out with success
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I myself, however, have abridged it from that, because of the great number of things which I have omitted from it on account of their proximity to my intention: and because I have set out the matter in a different form from that in which it was shown, and have exposed it in a different way
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say therefore, that which occurs in the abdomen from the front part, is neither an ailment nor is it curable from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And in like manner that which happens to the two sides also.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from that which happens except that which happens in the back part, as I have said: and it is that the patient be extended upon his face above a level platform near the wall: and let an oily dressing be applied under that, so that his chest is not injured thereby.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then let a fixed stool be placed in the fire in the earth, near the head: and let another stool be placed near the feet in the other foot: and let the minister hold the stool, and let it not be firm in the fire.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And let the other minister hold the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	And then draw over the head of the patient, and under his armpits a soft ligament, firm: and extend the extremity of the ligament to the limb which is at the head of him: and bind it in that.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	And then bind another ligament above his shoulders and above his knees and at his buttocks
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	And then gather up all the ligaments and bind them in the other limb which is at the feet of him.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	And then let all the ministers extend to the part of the limb of the ligaments, and do not move the two stools from the places where they are fixed: indeed they are not to be fixed, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician puts his palms upon the spine with force, until he is restored: or puts upon him a board
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	And then he binds upon the board his feet until he is restored
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	But if he does not recover by this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And the cavity in the wall from which we said is close to the patient, the place where the edge of the board enters.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board over the Spondilem.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the doctor place his feet on the other extremity
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And tighten well, until the Spondilem is taut, and then return to his place
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	And if you wish, work with the ankle that is involved with your hand: and that is, as two nails are placed at the foot of the patient at the end of the two thighs, and their length is that of one forearm: and at their head at the end of the two thighs.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length be that which is between every two nails be one palm: and when it is made in every place where there is a hole through which the screw runs: and fix every nail firmly in the earth very much, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And insert the round nail: and it is the screw in which the ligament is wound in two holes of the two nails.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its extremity is a hole in which the nail is fixed, whose length is one palm with that which is wound: and in two other nails is like that
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	And tighten the ligaments which you strained in the chest of the patient around the ankle which is at his head: and the ligaments which you strained in the thighs around the ankle which is at his feet
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	And stay at every screw minister, who twists his hand with a wrench, as the screw is wound: and the doctor will equal the Spondilem, as we said before.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the screw that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then, when Spondilis has returned and the place is evened, it is necessary to apply an ointment of desiccated plaster with albumin.
Deinde stuppam.	Then, plaster.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then place above the plaster a bandage of three fingers' breadth, or somewhat less
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length should be equal to the extent of the Gibbositas, and over the sound part of Spondilis.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is bound with the ligament which we mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And the patient should be nourished with light food until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If anything remains prominent in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary to administer medicines which soften and soothe, with the administration of the plaster which we mentioned previously for a long time
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And they are administered in that layer of lead
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes it happens that the prominence appears at the end of Spondilis dorsi: and it is thought to be dislocation, and that is the bone which is now prominent
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not right to assume for it any medicine: for perhaps it will happen that thereby it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	Of the treatment of dislocated Anchae.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You know that dislocations of the Anchae and of the humerus do not occur except for a complete dislocation: and that they do not occur except for a slight displacement and a concavity
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the dislocation of the Anchae is divided into four parts
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, because it is displaced forward and backward
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Most frequently it is displaced inwards: little is displaced outwards, and towards the rear.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	The treatment of such displacement inwards is: for when you unite the limb of the diseased with the limb of the healthy, it is longer: and the knee of the diseased limb is prominent more than that of the healthy limb, and the diseased limb cannot double its foot at the ankle: and the place which follows the ankle after displacement is the heel of the foot, because the head of the tibia has gone there.</start_of_turn>
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	The sign of such displacement outwards is that these are the opposite of the signs of the displacement inwards.</start_of_turn>
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	The sign of such displacement forwards is that it expands the healthy limb according to the complement: but it does not double itself without pain at the knee: and if it attempts to walk, it cannot go beyond that forwards: and it retains its urine, and its ankle is displaced, and during walking there is a swelling of the foot over the heel.</start_of_turn
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	The sign of such displacement backwards is that it does not expand the knee, and cannot double itself before it doubles the ankle: and the limb is also shorter than the other: and the ankle is softened, and the head of the tibia is at the level of the hip.</start_of_turn
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this displacement is of various kinds, so that as soon as possible, if the displacement is old, which has already become chronic, it should be abandoned with the one which has it.</start_of_turn>
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer the reduction and it remains according to its position: then there is no longer any treatment in that.</start_of_turn>
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	It is not necessary that there should be suspicion of a fracture.</start_of_turn>
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	But in that case in which the displacement is confirmed, and is of one of the four kinds of displacement: then it is proper for you to attempt to unite them, and to extend it inwards and outwards, and to move the limb from right to left: perhaps therefore it will return, and no other treatment will be necessary.</start_of_turn
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If it does not return in this way, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant and extend his leg from the lower part: either with your hands or with a ligature which is bound above his knee: and another assistant shall extend his hand above, so that he may insert his hand under his toes.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then bind with a soft ligature over the root of the thigh, and hold the end of the other ligature.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And keep the extension either from the front of the groin to the hip bone, or from the back to the loin.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And keep the extension firm until the patient raises himself with his body from the earth, and remains suspended.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this is indeed a common method of extension of four kinds.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If it returns therefore from the dislocation as we have said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary in every case to make use of the proper treatment.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In reduction, however, of its own when the dislocation is inwards, it is necessary that the patient rest on his sound side
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then lay the ligament over the root of the thigh, under the hip-bone, and under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligament upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the hip bone
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then take another strong assistant who grasps his arm, and presses the lower part of the thigh firmly, and extends it outwards with force.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	And thus it returns to its place
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	This is an easier method than the others for reducing this limb.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If, however, he excuses himself from you, and does not obey your order to enter with this sort of treatment: then it is necessary that two feet of the patient be bound together with strong, soft ligament, over two calcanei, and over two knees: and let the length of each be equal to four fingers. And let the affected limb be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	The affected limb is suspended over the head of the limb which is in the bed: and let its length from the earth be equal to the quantity of two arms
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command the young man to be strong, that he may support the hip: and suspend him with the patient: and let the young man push with force, supporting the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	But in its return, when the dislocation is outward, it is necessary that the patient lie upon a board, as we have said in the case of gibbosity.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And bind the ligament over his thigh, the patient himself, and over his breast
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	And put two boards, one at his feet and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	And place a board added in the middle of the foot, well fixed: over which are wet cloths, that it does not hurt the patient: and let the board be between his thighs, that it does not be drawn downwards during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then extend all the limbs towards their part, and the physician will equal the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore he obeys the reduction, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, put upon him another board, and press it down, just as we said in the case of gibbosity, equally
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	The patient must remain still, so that the sick person lies over the sound limb.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	When the dislocation is forward, then it is necessary to extend the limb of the patient quickly: and it is in accordance with this that the physician places his right palm over the knee of the sick person.</start_of_turn>
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he tightens the limb with the other hand, and with that tightening he brings the limb down to the foot.</start_of_turn>
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	If the dislocation is backward: then it is not necessary to extend the limb downwards, but rather to keep it elevated above the ground: for it is necessary to place it upon a firm support, just as it is necessary when the dislocation is wide in front, according to what we have said concerning its recumbency over two cushions: and it is upon its face and the ligaments extended: just as we said before.</start_of_turn>
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary to apply pressure with a board also over the place from which the joint has been extruded, when the reduction has been completed according to what is necessary.</start_of_turn>
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is that you extend both legs of the patient: and when you take them away equal, and the patient tightens his limb and expands it without groaning: then you know that the limb has returned, according to what is necessary: then join the two thighs together, and put on a bandage, and bind with a twist: so that it does not move to any part: and the patient must rest quietly for three days, or four.</start_of_turn>
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the ligament and the bandage, and compare the limb with the other: then if you take them away equal in position, then you know that the dislocation is fixed: absolutely therefore the patient can walk.</start_of_turn
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	If there is anything that softens: then return it, and plaster it, and bind it according to your first measure: and discharge it in three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then dissolve it and make it walk slowly on both sides for a few days, until it is comfortable.</start_of_turn>
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	(This sentence is not included in the translation request.)</start_of_turn>
Caput XXXIII.	(This section of the text is not included in the translation request.)</start_of_turn>
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The joint is dislocated in three ways.</start_of_turn
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is displaced outwards, inwards, and downwards, that is, backwards.</start_of_turn
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	It is not displaced forwards.</start_of_turn
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that the limb hangs limply from the limb.</start_of_turn
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	But if it does not adhere to the hip: then you know that the joint is dislocated.</start_of_turn
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all these ways of dislocation is that you make the patient sit upright, so that he can extend his limb as much as possible over it, and that he joins his back to his front: and place his foot between his feet.</start>
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then join his limb to your palms, and make it straight between his fingers over his joint.</start_of_turn
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm two sides of the joint with force.</start_of_turn
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another attendant extends his foot until the joint returns to its place.</start_of_turn
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of its return is that the limb adheres to the hip easily, not painfully.</start_of_turn
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then apply the plaster firmly, and secure the thigh to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind it thus for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ea.	Then loosen it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And do not permit the patient to walk for a few days, until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If, however, he resists reduction, then administer an extension of force with ligatures, as has been mentioned in the treatment of fracture, until it returns
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	(The text continues with instructions for treating a dislocation of the calcaneus.)
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The calcaneus is sometimes displaced by a small fracture, and sometimes by a dislocation of the fragment.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	It is displaced either inwards or outwards
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of dislocation is that the calcaneus is swollen and displaced towards the part which is displaced
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment for its removal is simple restoration: it is to extend it easily with the hands, and to reduce it, until it returns
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	When it is dislocated by the fragment, it is necessary to keep the patient sitting upright: and to hold it firmly from behind the back of his ankle, in the middle of it
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then take hold with your right hand the upper part of his foot, and with your left hand the lower part of his foot at the ankle joint
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	And pull the foot towards you with your right hand
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	And with your left hand support his ankle joint with two fingers
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend it with your left hand, and push the ankle joint with your right hand without straining.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do it twice, as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then drive the thumb of the foot against the thigh in the hollow of the third digit, and you grasp the heel.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If it returns once, or twice according to this method, and you have equated the foot, it is good: and if not, repeat the operation above itself: for it will return itself
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if it is hindered by you from reduction as we have said: then make the patient lie upon his back upon the earth, and fix the heel firmly to the ground, so that it lies between the patient's thighs: and you shall grasp above it, so that it does not hurt the patient.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then take hold of the knee: afterwards extend the other limb of the foot, either with the hands or with a strap that binds over the ankle bone
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then extend all the limbs against the extension of each other: and the heel shall be stable between the two thighs of the patient holding it back, so that it does not draw the body downwards with the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician must equate the dislocation with his hands, and the other limb must hold the sound limb downwards.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When it has returned, and the soundness of the reduction is declared: then put on a bandage and plaster, and bind up the limb firmly with ligaments, and bind the foot to the ankle bone
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary to beware of the nerves which are above the heel behind, so that there is no tension on the ligaments above them, and that it does not hurt them
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let it go in two or three days
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the ligament is softened, string it up: then dissolve it on the third or fourth day. And restrain the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If he attempts to walk before that space has healed, there will be no security that it will be dissolved without causing displacement, corruption, and not recovering after that
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If there is a swelling there: then it is necessary to manage it in calm in that place where our account precedes concerning treatment, and bandage, until it is removed
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	About the dislocation of the toes, and treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 5.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary to restore what is dislocated from the bone with little extension without labor: and this is not difficult, indeed it is easy
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If, however, the dislocation is in some part of the ankle: then it is necessary to make the patient sit down and rest his foot on the same level as the earth, or on a board: and he should be in the same position as if he were walking
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then stay still, and put your foot on that which projects from these joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then bandage your foot with your foot with force, until it returns, and that it is even and does not appear in the eminence.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then put under the foot of him a board that can grasp the whole foot, which has two heads
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then string it up with a tight bandage for three days
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then dissolve it, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is bound up and secured from reduction
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	About the kinds of dislocation with wound or fracture
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When anything of this sort happens, and you know the cure for it, and its restoration, many times follows after: and because of that it does not befit you to be proud over the cure of it, which is like this, except that he who is prudent in the art of long usage, merciful, pious, tardy, not audacious, and not proud: and that he should be content with the advice of the physicians who sit beside the calida apostemata.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Except that you are stupid, or hope for health from the gentleness of the disease, and in which there appears something of hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Try therefore to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before the calida apostema appears
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If therefore the limb returns, as we would wish, then administer a regimen which will settle the apostema: and care for the wound with what agrees with it from the desiccation.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If it is a dislocation with fracture, and they are separated from the bone in the sitting posture, then try to effect their ablation, and do in that which we said in the simple ailments from that which preceded them in those places
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And be careful according to your ability, and keep yourself away from the entrance of fear: according as I have foretold to you beforehand.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For it is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more health for your body with them in your time.
