Many times, a bone or fish spine or something else gets stuck in the throat; so you must try to extract what you can see, and press down the tongue in the sunlight with an instrument, so you can see the object; and what you cannot see and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach; perhaps the object will come out through vomiting; or the patient can swallow a piece of sponge, or a piece of turnip, or a lettuce root, or a morsel of dry bread; and tie a thread to the sponge, and then have him swallow it; and when it reaches the spot, it will stick, and then you will pull it out; and if it does not come out with what we have said, then take an instrument of lead in this form:
And let the instrument be curved at the end so that it can more easily enter the throat, and have the end raised; and be careful not to touch the epiglottis, so the cough does not occur, nor push the bone in; and better that the patient inserts the instrument, as he knows where the object is; then push it down, or pull it out evenly with the instrument, until it is out.
