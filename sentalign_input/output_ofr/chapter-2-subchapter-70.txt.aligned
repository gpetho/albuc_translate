of hermaphrodites	On the treatment of the hermaphrodite.	0.44413206
Hermaphroditism exists in two ways in humans: one is that between the two testicles appears something like the form of a woman's nature, where there is hair, and sometimes urine flows there.	There are two kinds of male hermaphrodite: one has the appearance as of female pudenda with hair in the region of the perineum; the other has the same in the skin of the scrotum between the testes. Sometimes also urine is excreted through that which is in the skin of the scrotum.	0.7917815
And the other type is in women, and they have above the pubis something like a penis and two testicles.	There is also one kind among women, in which there is, above the female pudenda, on the pubes, what resembles the male organs.	0.7132319
And the treatment for the man and the woman is that you cut away all the added flesh and treat them like other wounds;	This is the treatment of all three kinds, that is, two male and one female: the superfluous growths must be cut away so that every trace is destroyed; then the usual treatment for wounds should be applied until they are healed.	0.58313
in the second type, for men whose urine spurts through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.	As to the second kind, in man, where the opening is in the scrotum and the urine runs out of it, there is no operation for this, and no cure.	0.7484868
