Of the foul-smelling pustules
Sometimes, stinking pustules appear on the surface of the body, which come from large corrupted matters. It is necessary at first, when they appear, to make a cautery on the head of each pustule: a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, with the point heated in fire, or of the long root of aristolochia, or with the lenticular cautery. And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, in this manner, and they cannot grow from then on, but the excess from which they come is disrupted, and they are healed; but it is necessary that this be done after blood evacuation.
