The eighth chapter on cauterizing forgetfulness that is caused by phlegm.
The patient should first be given to drink from the major electuaries and brain-purifying pills.
Then his entire head should be shaved.
And the mustard poultice described in the chapter on poultices should be applied to his posterior.
Apply it several times, for it is a kind of cautery.
And do that in the same order that I mentioned there.
If he is cured by that, then fine, otherwise cauterize him with three cauterizations on the back of his head, aligned from the top of the head to the bottom of the neck.
And make the distance between each cauterization the width of a finger.
Then treat the cautery with what was mentioned previously.
If you want to increase it, and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle cauterization.
If you want to increase it further, cauterize him on the two temples.
Then treat him until he recovers.
And the cautery iron should be olive-shaped, in the form that was described before.
